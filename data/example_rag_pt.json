It's okay for users to use an escape hatch and invoke TF/CDK on specific clouds\n\nBuild features fast now, optimize cost later\n\nWe must have a culture of cost optimization which will lead to insights for building FinOps features for customers\n\nAcorn is optimized for remote development\n\nAcorn is a multi\\-cloud dev and ops tool\n\nAcorn is an AWS dev and ops tool\n\nAcorn enables truly portable development experience across laptops and clouds\n\nWe spend a lot of effort to make things work with AWSxa0IAM and VPC\n\nDon’t do anything special for AWS that we wouldn’t do for Azure and GCP\n\nApply our learnings\n\nTeams users primarily invoke AWS service acorns directly\n\nSame experience for Teams and Pro users, other than BYO cloud credentials\n\nTakeaways\n\nHigh priority: Ship Acorn GA\n\nFocus on developers, delay enterprise edition\n\nAcorn manager will stay closed source for now\n\nOnly AWS matters \\=\\> Equal treatment of AWS, Azure, GCP, private cloud, edge, and

Update\n\nShannon Williams\n\nAcorn Beta Launch\n\nAcorn Beta is live!\n\nMessaging focusedxa0onxa0Sandbox use case – launch an Acorn, free cloud sandbox,xa0tutorials, training.\n\nGood initial wave of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running specific workloads in the cloud.\n\nBuild Acorns for users to evaluate new projects with native momentum.\n\nFocus on popular tools with strong search volume that users want to evaluate/self\\-host.xa0 (CMS, DBs,xa0Tools, Apps, etc.)\n\nwww.acorn.io\n\nThank you\n\nWhat is a \"Cloud Native Developer Platform\"\n\nIt is a software platform that developers use to build and run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage17\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage18\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage19\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage20\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage21\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage22\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage23\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage24\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage25\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage33\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage34\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage26\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage27\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage28\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage29\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage30\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage31\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage32\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage35\\.jpeg\n\n=============\n\nimage36\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage37\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage38\\.png\n\n============"},{"text":"All

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running specific workloads in the cloud.\n\nBuild Acorns for users to evaluate new projects with native momentum.\n\nFocus on popular tools with strong search volume that users want to

developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models,

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All

of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n\nCurrently at 630 accounts and 2700 Acorns launched\n\nNear\\-term goal isxa01000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\nLaunch Coverage\n\nSecured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and techxa0tradexa0publications, which put the news in front of potentialxa0users, buyersxa0and investors.\n\n6 pieces of coverage were features stories, sharing morexa0informationxa0about Acorn than a standard press releasexa0posting.\n\nKubecon Feedback\n\n900\\+ booth scans, was excellent.\n\nConsistent agreement from users about our problem statement.xa0 Companies like Adobe, Pfizer and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n\nUser reaction to Acorn was mixed.xa0 xa0Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day\\-to\\-day experience with k8s.\n\nWe have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees.xa0 The \"Ah\\-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n\nOverall show enthusiasm was moderate.xa0 Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\nUser Acquisition Programs\n\nPromote Acorn development experience for Languagexa0workloads – Catalog, tutorials, SEO, advertising, influencer marketing around building and running

extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can

Production deals with YAML and Helm charts. Acorn introduces a new application artifact called Acorn images. Developers build the exact same Acorn images that are deployed in production. Acorn brings improved team productivity, operational efficiency, and software development agility. |\n\n| What is in an Acorn image? | An Acorn Image contains one or more Docker images, application configuration files, and deployment specifications. Acorn images are by default secure and can be signed. |\n\nAcorn open source launch\n\nExpectations of the initial open source launch\n\nThe Acorn open source project is just the beginning. It lays the foundation for many more exciting future developments to come from Acorn Labs. The key innovation is for the first time, development and production can work with the same application artifact.\n\n### Our realistic expectations:\n\nAcorn will not appeal to Kubernetes experts who already learned how to deploy containerized apps using YAML or Helm charts.\n\nAcorn will appeal to developers and DevOps engineers who work with Docker containers but have not mastered Kubernetes operations.\n\nAcorn will also appeal to Kubernetes cluster operators looking for ways to onboard more application workload to their clusters.\n\nThere'll bexa0more to come! AcornHub will be scopedxa0shortly after the initial open source launch.\n\nAdministrative Update\n\nMatt Cunningham\n\n[This Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicholas_t/9660710884/) by Unknown author is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n\nAdministrative Update 1/2\n\n### Post Series Seed have kicked off a number of items to get Acorn Labs up and running operationally:\n\n| YTD Implementation Updates |\n\n| --- |\n\n| Upwork |\n\n| 2\\.

run cloud native workloads/software/applications.\n\nThe platform provides developers with an unopinionated language for describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n\nIt ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud native security best practices.\n\nIt provides access toxa0the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud native application.\n\nIt can be extended to encompass the provisioning andxa0management of external cloud services.\n\nIt allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n\nIt allows developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\nHow is it different than a traditional PaaS.​\n\nDoes notxa0try to subsume CI, because of this it seems much less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.​\n\nIt is designed for maximum architecturalxa0flexibility;xa0andxa0can deploy any type of cloud native application.xa0​\n\nIs cloud agnostic, because it is built on Kubernetes, and can runxa0anywhere that is available.xa0​\n\nIt can provision and manage external cloud\\-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.​\n\nimage4\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage3\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage2\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage1\\.png\n\n===========\n\nimage11\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage12\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage13\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage14\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage15\\.png\n\n============\n\nimage16\\.png\n\n============\n\n/docProps/thumbnail.jpeg"},{"text":"All
