It's okay for users to use an escape hatch and invoke TF/CDK on specific clouds\n- Build features fast now, optimize cost later\n- We must have a culture of cost optimization which will lead to insights for building FinOps features for customers\n\n### Acorn Capabilities\n\n- Acorn is optimized for remote development\n- Acorn is a multi-cloud dev and ops tool\n- Acorn is an AWS dev and ops tool\n- Acorn enables truly portable development experience across laptops and clouds\n- We spend a lot of effort to make things work with AWS IAM and VPC\n- Don’t do anything special for AWS that we wouldn’t do for Azure and GCP\n- Apply our learnings\n- Teams users primarily invoke AWS service acorns directly\n- Same experience for Teams and Pro users, other than BYO cloud credentials\n\n### Takeaways\n\n- **High priority:** Ship Acorn GA\n- Focus on developers, delay enterprise edition\n- Acorn manager will stay closed source for now\n- Only AWS matters ⇒ Equal treatment of AWS, Azure, GCP, private cloud, edge, and laptop\n- Remote development ⇒ Local laptop development\n- A culture of cloud cost optimization\n\n---\n\n## Admin Update\n\n### Matt Cunningham\n\n**Admin Update & Q3 Financial Snapshot**\n\n- Priorities for the next few weeks:\n  - Chargebee integration with Acorn\n  - HubSpot / ServiceHub integration with Chargebee\n- **Company Holidays:**\n  - November 23 & 24 are Acorn Company holidays next week!\n- **W2s:**\n  - Will be sent out in January through the Rippling user portal\n  - Depending on the state, you may have two W2s (one for Acorn and one for Rippling PEO)\n\n### Q3 Financial Update\n\n| Quarter Ended Sept 30, 2023 | Metric    |\n| -------------------------- | --------- |\n| Cash Burn                  | $1.2M     |\n| Ending Cash                | $29.7M    |\n\n**Admin Items**\n\n- Q3 Financial Update\n  - Continued focus on profitable growth\n  - Efficient Business = Long Term Value\n\n---\n\n## Company Offsite at re:Invent\n\n### Will Chan\n\n**Company Offsite Agenda**\n\n- **Purpose:**\n  - Engineering team to get together a couple of times a year.\n  - Opportunity to learn AI and understand what AWS users and developers want as part of their development and deployment toolkit.\n- **Schedule:**\n  - **Sun 11/26**\n    - Engineering team and early arrival setup for booth if available\n  - **Mon 11/27**\n    - 11am – 3pm: Engineering outing at AREA51\n    - 3:30pm: Engineering meet at re:Invent booth with rest of company\n    - 4pm – 7pm: Expo opens\n    - 8pm – 9:30pm: Acorn team dinner at Fogo de Chao\n  - **Tue 11/28**\n    - 7pm: Acorn team dinner at the Wynn buffet\n\n---\n\n## GTM Update\n\n### Shannon Williams\n\n**Acorn Beta Launch**\n\n- Acorn Beta is live!\n- **Messaging focused on Sandbox use case:**\n  - Launch an Acorn\n  - Free cloud sandbox\n  - Tutorials\n  - Training\n- **Current Status:**\n  - Good initial wave of new accounts, but daily adoption is still low.\n  - Currently at 630 accounts and 2,700 Acorns launched\n  - **Near-term goal:** 1,000 accounts and 10,000 Acorns by end of year.\n\n### Launch Coverage\n\n- Secured 12 pieces of coverage in target DevOps and tech trade publications, which put the news in front of potential users, buyers, and investors.\n- 6 pieces of coverage were feature stories, sharing more information about Acorn than a standard press release posting.\n\n### Kubecon Feedback\n\n- 900+ booth scans, was excellent.\n- Consistent agreement from users about our problem statement. Companies like Adobe, Pfizer, and Discover validated that they are struggling with figuring out the \"operating system\" for Kubernetes.\n- User reaction to Acorn was mixed. Some people came back the second day having downloaded it and tried it out, but many didn't seem to see how it would change their day-to-day experience with k8s.\n- We have work to do to delight regular Kubecon attendees. The \"Ah-ha!\" is still hard to generate.\n- Overall show enthusiasm was moderate. Lots of people asking about work, and anticipating layoffs, especially at large vendors.\n\n### User Acquisition Programs\n\n- Promote Acorn development experience for Language workloads:\n  - Catalog\n  - Tutorials\n  - SEO\n  - Advertising\n  - Influencer marketing around building and running specific workloads in the cloud.\n- Build Acorns for users to evaluate new projects with native momentum.\n- Focus on popular tools with strong search volume that users want to evaluate/self-host (CMS, DBs, Tools, Apps, etc.)\n\n[www.acorn.io](https://www.acorn.io)\n\n---\n\n## What is a \"Cloud Native Developer Platform\"\n\nA **Cloud Native Developer Platform** is a software platform that developers use to build and run cloud-native workloads/software/applications. It offers the following features:\n\n- **Unopinionated Language:** For describing services, their relationships, and requirements.\n- **Security:** Ensures developers only deploy services that meet cloud-native security best practices.\n- **Infrastructure Access:** Provides access to the infrastructure capabilities necessary to run a cloud-native application.\n- **Extensibility:** Can be extended to encompass the provisioning and management of external cloud services.\n- **Troubleshooting:** Allows developers to troubleshoot running applications.\n- **Packaging & Sharing:** Enables developers to package and share services and deployment logic with one another.\n\n### How is it Different Than a Traditional PaaS?\n\n- **CI Integration:** Does not try to subsume CI, making it less opinionated about the software development lifecycle.\n- **Architectural Flexibility:** Designed for maximum architectural flexibility and can deploy any type of cloud-native application.\n- **Cloud Agnostic:** Built on Kubernetes and can run anywhere that is available.\n- **External Services Management:** Can provision and manage external cloud-based platform services, such as databases, queuing services, AI models, etc.\n\n---\n\n## Images\n\n![Image 1](image1.png)\n---\n![Image 2](image2.png)\n---\n![Image 3](image3.png)\n---\n![Image 4](image4.png)\n---\n![Image 11](image11.png)\n---\n![Image 12](image12.png)\n---\n![Image 13](image13.png)\n---\n![Image 14](image14.png)\n---\n![Image 15](image15.png)\n---\n![Image 16](image16.png)\n---\n![Image 17](image17.png)\n---\n![Image 18](image18.png)\n---\n![Image 19](image19.png)\n---\n![Image 20](image20.png)\n---\n![Image 21](image21.png)\n---\n![Image 22](image22.png)\n---\n![Image 23](image23.png)\n---\n![Image 24](image24.png)\n---\n![Image 25](image25.png)\n---\n![Image 26](image26.png)\n---\n![Image 27](image27.png)\n---\n![Image 28](image28.png)\n---\n![Image 29](image29.png)\n---\n![Image 30](image30.png)\n---\n![Image 31](image31.png)\n---\n![Image 32](image32.png)\n---\n![Image 33](image33.png)\n---\n![Image 34](image34.png)\n---\n![Image 35](image35.jpeg)\n---\n![Image 36](image36.png)\n---\n![Image 37](image37.png)\n---\n![Image 38](image38.png)\n---\n```\n"}]
