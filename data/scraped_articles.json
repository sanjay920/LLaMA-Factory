        "content": "Around the world, sewage pollutes oceans, harms coral reefs, and threatens our health. But it doesn’t have to.  By connecting homes, businesses, and tourist facilities to community-supported wastewater treatment plants, we can significantly reduce the amount of harmful pollutants discharged into the ocean.  These systems remove contaminants that contribute to coral bleaching, disease, and reef degradation.   Additionally, community education and government collaboration play crucial roles in maintaining these systems and promoting sustainable practices. Through these combined efforts, we can protect and preserve coral reefs for future generations.    will have outsized impacts on our precious ocean ecosystems. Saving coral reefs with wastewater solutions has clear, tangible impacts, which is why we’re focusing our efforts on expanding this work. Keep reading for ten ways properly treated wastewater can revolutionize reef and community health. This may seem obvious, but it’s worth overstating.  Science tells us corals can adapt to a warmer ocean if they have clean water and healthy fish populations. Contaminants and pathogens in untreated wastewater can lead to increased stress and susceptibility to disease in corals. Wastewater infrastructure helps reduce or even eliminate pollutants and contaminants in the ocean, improving overall water quality. Providing clean water to these areas can help prevent coral bleaching and disease, allowing corals to grow and thrive. Clean water ensures a healthier environment for coral growth and resilience, and the benefits of this are invaluable. Not only does supporting a diverse range of marine species enhance the entire ecosystem, but it’s also a major pillar in climate adaptation. Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine life, and clean water helps maintain the delicate balance required for these ecosystems to flourish. Healthier reefs lead to more abundant fish populations, benefiting corals and local fishing industries. Coral reefs provide essential habitats for many fish species, and cleaner water supports their breeding and feeding grounds. Who wants to swim in dirty water? No one.  Pristine reefs attract more tourists to coastal communities, boosting local economies reliant on diving, snorkeling, and beach activities. Clean water ensures that coral reefs remain vibrant and appealing to visitors, promoting sustainable tourism. Cleaner water means safer, more enjoyable beaches for swimming and recreation. Reducing the contaminants that reach coastal areas ensures that beaches remain inviting and free from health hazards. Reducing exposure to waterborne diseases drastically improves public health in coastal communities. Proper wastewater treatment prevents the spread of pathogens that can cause serious illnesses in humans.Did we mention 80% of coastal communities don’t have properly treated wastewater?  Sustaining livelihoods dependent on marine resources and tourism promotes economic resilience. Healthy coral reefs support industries such as fishing and tourism, which are vital to the economies of many coastal communities. They also act as natural barriers against storm surges and erosion, preventing the destruction of coastal properties and loss of land and saving money on coastal defense measures. Healthy reefs play a crucial role in carbon sequestration by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide through calcification. Corals and other reef-building organisms use carbon to form calcium carbonate structures, which make up the reef. This process helps mitigate the impacts of climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Additionally, the dense and diverse ecosystems supported by coral reefs contribute to the overall carbon storage capacity of marine environments, enhancing their role in global carbon cycling and climate regulation. Wastewater treatment plants and processes create avenues for environmental education and awareness to help foster a culture of conservation and sustainable practices. Clean water initiatives provide opportunities to educate the public about the importance of protecting coral reefs and the role of wastewater treatment in maintaining ocean health. Clean water is essential for the survival of all things, especially coral reefs and the overall health of our oceans. By addressing wastewater issues, we directly impact the preservation of these vital ecosystems. Join us on our journey to better wastewater management by supporting our Clean Water for Reefs campaign and help us protect the future of coral reefs.   and be a part of the solution."

        "content": "How do we decide where to focus our efforts in saving coral reefs? It’s a question we get asked a lot, and the answer is both strategic and deeply rooted in our mission.  So let’s get into it!   – climate adaptation needs, local leadership and partnerships, and the resource needs of communities. First and foremost,   Coral reefs are more than just beautiful underwater landscapes; they are interconnected ecosystems that rely on ocean currents to transport coral larvae from one reef to another. This natural process creates resilient networks capable of adapting to climate change. Take the islands of   (Maui, Lanai, and Molokai) in Hawaii, for example. These islands are connected by ocean currents that allow coral, fish, and invertebrate larvae to travel between them, seeding neighboring reefs. This interconnectedness is the backbone of our strategy, helping us design marine protected areas that support each other and enhance overall coral reef conservation. Our second consideration is the presence of local leaders who are willing to partner with us. Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We work with community leaders, non-profits, and local governments who understand the importance of coral reef conservation and are eager to implement sustainable practices. These partnerships are essential for promoting  and ensuring the long-term success of our conservation efforts. When communities invite us to the table and seek our expertise, it creates a powerful synergy. Together, we can develop and implement strategies that protect marine environments while benefiting local populations. It’s about working hand-in-hand with those who know and love their reefs best, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in conservation efforts. Finally, we focus on areas where coral reefs are in urgent need of intervention and the communities lack the necessary resources to protect them. Many regions around the world struggle with limited infrastructure and funding to effectively manage their marine ecosystems. By concentrating our efforts on these under-resourced areas, we provide the   needed to restore and preserve vulnerable coral reefs.

        "content": "Say hello to our adventurous addition to the leadership team! When she isn’t exploring in her overland Jeep, Kristy Ives is working tirelessly to protect the beautiful planet she loves to explore. With over 25 years of experience in non-profit finance management, Kristy brings a unique blend of expertise and passion to CORAL.  Kristy’s love for the ocean began early. Growing up in Miami, Florida, just a stone’s throw from the Florida Keys, she spent her childhood exploring the underwater world. “I grew up boating, snorkeling, and diving in Biscayne National Park,” she recalls. This early connection to the sea sparked a lifelong passion for marine conservation. Her journey took her to the University of West Florida in Pensacola, where she majored in environmental resources. “I chose this university because it had a 1,000-acre wildlife preserve, much of which was beachfront—ideal for my studies.” Now, she lives on a serene lake just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, but her heart remains tethered to the ocean. Kristy’s journey into non-profit finance was an unexpected yet fortunate turn of events. After graduating, she landed a job at the National Audubon Society. “The Director needed someone to help with the budget, and I volunteered. It quickly became apparent that I had a natural talent for finances and budgeting,” she explains. This newfound talent led her to earn a degree in finance, blending her passion for the environment with her financial skills. Her innovative approach at Audubon, where she transformed the budget model and improved fundraising strategies, set the stage for her role at CORAL.  When she’s not working, Kristy and her partner, Sam, spend three months a year overlanding in their Jeep, exploring remote and stunning landscapes. “We take our Jeep, which pulls a small off-road trailer, out into the wilderness. We’re talking public lands where there aren’t people for miles. We actually work on the road, using Starlink for internet,” she says. Kristy is also a passionate diver. One of her favorite dive experiences was when she swam through a massive school of moon jellies and came face-to-face with a manta ray. “It was enormous and absolutely amazing.

        "category": null,
        "content": "As we mark one year since the devastating wildfires that swept through Lahaina, Maui, I want to share a personal reflection on the impact of this tragedy and our ongoing journey of recovery. My name is Makayla Rickard, and as the Maui Nui Program Manager at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), both my work and my life are deeply intertwined with this community and its vibrant ecosystems. The fires that tore through Lahaina not only ravaged homes and landscapes but also shattered the fabric of our community. For me, this event was more than a professional challenge—it was a deeply personal one. My family and I lost our home, and in the aftermath, we found ourselves displaced, moving multiple times and facing significant hurdles. Finding stable housing has been a continuous struggle, especially with the added challenge of having a beloved pet.  In the year since the fires, our island has been on a journey of recovery—one that is as complex as it is hopeful. The fires left a deep scar on Maui, with over 1,399 homes destroyed and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble.   Iconic places like Banyan Tree Park and the Lahaina public library are back open to residents, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the recovery efforts. The beloved Banyan tree, which was heavily damaged, has shown remarkable signs of regrowth, a symbol of our resilience.   Affordable housing is still a critical issue, and many in our community remain displaced, grappling with the ongoing emotional toll of the tragedy. In response to the fires, CORAL launched the   to provide unrestricted support to local environmental organizations and initiatives. The aim was to empower those who know Maui best—our local leaders, community members, and grassroots organizations—to address the most urgent environmental needs during this time of crisis. Over the past year, this fund has supported a wide range of environmental recovery efforts. One of the organizations supported by the fund is  , which has potted 3,500 trees in 14 grow hubs across Maui and is partnering with master carver Dale Zarella on a series of carvings called “Rising from the Ashes; Spirits of Lāhainā.” These creations, crafted from burned trees, symbolize the resilience and regeneration of our land. Another organization supported by the fund is the  , a grassroots coalition formed to address the environmental damage caused by the fires in Maui. Their mission is to heal the burn scars on the island using bioremediation—natural mitigation methods involving native plants, fungi, and locally-made compost. Their work focuses on making the soil safer for future planting, improving water quality, and protecting the ocean from toxic runoff. The outpouring of support from across the globe has been overwhelming, and I’m deeply moved by the generosity of those who have contributed. When the wildfire swept through Lahaina last August, it left behind a trail of toxic ash, laced with contaminants like arsenic, lead, and copper. These pollutants now pose a serious threat to nearshore health, which are vital to both our community’s economic stability and our cultural identity. Our regional program director, Manuel Mejia, often reminds us of the Hawaiian proverb, “E ola ke kai, E ola kākou,” meaning “As the sea thrives, so do we.” This connection between our well-being and the health of our reefs is deeply rooted in our lives here. In the immediate aftermath, barriers were installed around storm drains to filter out debris, but much of the ash still makes its way into the ocean.   are working tirelessly to monitor the situation. Citizen scientists are using drones to film runoff, and researchers are collecting soil and water samples to understand the extent of the contamination. For example, Dr. Andrea Kealoha from the University of Hawaii has been deploying water sensors that capture data on everything from oxygen levels to water movement, providing a clearer picture of how our reefs are responding.  In the short term, fewer human stressors like tourism might offer some temporary relief, but the long-term effects remain uncertain. There’s also concern about potential toxins building up in fish, threatening food security for many who rely on the reef for their sustenance. As we continue to navigate these challenges, we’re committed to protecting and restoring our precious marine ecosystems, ensuring that they can thrive once again. There’s still so much to be done, but the resilience and determination of the Maui community give me hope. Every day, I’m inspired by the people around me—the neighbors who’ve turned their homes into makeshift shelters, the volunteers who’ve shown up day after day, and the donors who’ve contributed to our recovery efforts. This past year has been the most challenging of my life, but it has also been a testament to the power of community. To everyone who has supported us—whether through donations, volunteer work, or simply keeping us in your thoughts—mahalo. Your support means the world to us as we continue the long road to rebuilding and restoring our island home."

        "content": "Coral reefs are under constant threat from human impacts, and sometimes destruction comes from the people who spend the most time underwater enjoying these beautiful ecosystems up close. For many years, the CORAL team has worked to more deeply understand the tourism impacts from scuba diving and snorkeling so we can use our learnings to inform people across the globe about best practices. Our latest study, published in  , focused on scuba diving in Roatan, Honduras. We looked at the number of divers that different sites can sustainably handle (known as carrying capacity) and how diver behavior affects the reefs. We paid special attention to certification levels and the use of lionfish spears, which are used to control invasive species. After monitoring 180 divers across several sites, we found big differences in how many divers each site could handle—some sites could support 13,000 more divers per year than others.  So, what does this mean for reef conservation? Dr. Antonella Rivera, one of our researchers, explains: “This study shows how important it is to understand how many divers each reef can handle to avoid damaging it. Many factors affect this, including the skill level of divers and how they use spearfishing tools. To protect reefs, we need to regularly assess and adjust these numbers and use this information to guide our decisions.”   The study highlighted substantial variation in the number of divers that different sites could sustainably support. This finding tells a story of the importance of site-specific management strategies to prevent overuse and degradation.   Divers’ behaviors, especially those related to their certification levels, significantly affect the physical integrity of the reefs. Less experienced divers tend to cause more damage, often unintentionally, due to poor buoyancy control and lack of awareness.   While lionfish, an invasive species, pose a serious threat to Caribbean reefs, the study suggests that the method of spearfishing, if not properly managed, can inadvertently harm the coral reefs. This calls for a reassessment of current spearfishing practices and the implementation of more controlled and informed methods. The findings from Roatan indicate a clear need for educational programs, especially for newer divers. Workshops and courses focusing on the ecological impacts of diving can significantly mitigate damage to coral reefs. Educating divers about proper  , the importance of  , and the   can lead to more sustainable diving practices. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of  . The way CORAL incorporates this into our work is by ensuring   use these results and replicate these types of assessments to inform their local management strategies. By regularly monitoring and adjusting the number of divers allowed at specific sites, based on the health and resilience of the reefs, long-term sustainability can be achieved. The study conducted in Roatan offers valuable insights into the complex relationship between tourism and coral reef health. It’s also a clear example of CORAL’s strategies.  We focus on actionable science – deepening the collective understanding of the many aspects of coral reef conservation. By understanding the carrying capacities of different sites and the impacts of diver behavior, we can develop more effective management practices.  Roatan’s reefs, like many around the world, require our attention and care to thrive amidst growing tourism pressures. Through informed and adaptive management, we can ensure that the beauty and biodiversity of these underwater worlds remain intact."

        "content": "For over 30 years, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) has been at the forefront of coral reef conservation. What began as a small group of SCUBA divers passionate about protecting these ecosystems has grown into a global alliance, dedicated to saving coral reefs through innovative partnerships, global conservation science, and community-driven action. Our mission centers around the holistic approach that assesses, protects, and restores coral reefs, allowing them to adapt to the threats of climate change. Guided by NOAA’s definition of coral reef restoration as the “process of assisting the recovery of coral reefs that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed,” our   efforts focus on nurturing ecosystems back to health and resilience by reducing threats. This means our team works threats to coral ecosystems by improving water quality and promoting sustainable fishing practices, while also supporting community-led, climate-smart conservation efforts, resulting in long-lasting stewardship of coral reef ecosystems Coral reefs are critical to marine biodiversity, support coastal communities, and act as natural barriers against storm surges. However, they are under severe threat from pollution, unsustainable fishing, and climate change, with predictions that almost all coral reefs could be lost by 2050 if current trends continue. CORAL recognizes that while climate change is a profound challenge, coral reefs can still adapt—if we reduce local pressures. Through threat reduction in the form of clean water and sustainable fisheries initiatives, we are actively working to restore coral resilience, biodiversity, and community support for long-term reef health. Healthy coral reefs require clean water, but pollution from land-based sources, such as untreated or improperly treated wastewater and sediment runoff, often disrupts this balance. Polluted water causes stress, disease, and degradation in marine ecosystems, making it harder for corals to survive. CORAL’s Clean Water for Reefs initiative tackles this issue head-on by working with local communities to assess water quality, advocate for laws supporting wastewater and watershed management, and operationalize pollution-control infrastructure. Our efforts in clean water management include: CORAL collaborates with community partners to build and manage wastewater treatment plants in critical areas, ensuring that sewage is kept out of the ocean.  For example, in West End, Roatan, CORAL’s support of a local wastewater treatment plant has prevented 29 million gallons of sewage from reaching the reefs each year. In Coxen Hole, we’re advancing efforts to expand this capacity and expect to prevent an additional 49 million gallons of wastewater pollution by the end of 2025. The restoration work happening here is essential for the recovery of our coasts and the survival of marine life. We are enhancing the reef’s ability to withstand climate-related stress. There has been a restoration of the reef because of our wastewater treatment facility as well as a restoration of hope for the community. Sediment runoff from erosion and land development smothers coral reefs, blocking sunlight and hindering coral growth. Through watershed restoration and fishpond rehabilitation projects, particularly in Hawai’i, we’re preventing large amounts of sediment from reaching reefs and preserving these essential marine habitats. In 2025, we’ll begin assessing how this work in Hawai’i can influence other areas in the Pacific Islands with the same threats. Hand-in-hand with our Protect work, CORAL is improving water quality by advocating for strong environmental policies and engaging local communities in stewardship. In Hawai’i, for instance, we introduced legislation to expedite cesspool conversion, a necessary step to reduce sewage pollution and protect both coral reefs and public health. These initiatives are grounded in actionable science, allowing CORAL to measure progress and make evidence-based adjustments to our strategies. Over time, our Clean Water for Reefs efforts have led to measurable reductions in fecal bacteria levels in coastal waters, improvements in water quality, and decreased harmful macro algae that threaten coral habitats. Overfishing is another major threat to coral reefs, as it disrupts the delicate balance of reef ecosystems. CORAL’s sustainable fisheries programs work to restore fish populations and reef biodiversity by collaborating with local communities to establish protected areas and enforce sustainable fishing practices. With community partners, CORAL has established and improved the management of protected areas across marine ecosystems in the Western Caribbean, Fiji, the Coral Triangle (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines),  and Hawai’i. These protected areas serve as safe havens for fish populations, allowing them to grow and contribute to the overall health of the coral reefs. In partnership with coastal communities, CORAL’s fisheries projects aim to enhance fish biomass—by as much as 200% in some regions—thus benefiting both the reef and local livelihoods. Healthier reefs provide a more stable habitat for fish, allowing fishers to harvest higher-quality catches, which helps build a sustainable economy around responsible fishing. Our most recent sustainable fisheries work includes two fishpond restoration projects on the island of  . These ancient Hawaiian fishponds, unique to the Pacific Islands, once supported local communities by maintaining abundant and sustainable fish populations. CORAL has joined forces with community nonprofit Ka Honua Momona in Molokai to restore these ponds, which removes sediment buildup, controls invasive species, and promotes sustainable fishing practices. By reviving these traditional systems, we not only help protect the local reefs from harmful sediment but also honor and support local culture and livelihoods. This work enhances the resilience of reef ecosystems around Molokai and preserves a heritage practice that strengthens both community and ecological health. Our sustainable fisheries work is essential to restoring balance in reef ecosystems, helping them recover from past pressures and adapt to changing conditions. CORAL’s Restore efforts—centered around threat reduction in the form of clean water and sustainable fisheries—are critical to the health and resilience of coral reefs worldwide.  By addressing pollution and overfishing, we’re creating the conditions that allow coral reefs to adapt and survive in a rapidly changing world. Our commitment to science-based action, community engagement, and policy advocacy continues to yield meaningful results, with cleaner waters, healthier fish populations, and stronger reefs that support both biodiversity and coastal communities. Through our partnerships with local stakeholders and our dedication to long-term conservation solutions, CORAL is not only working to save coral reefs but also to foster a global community united by a common goal: to protect and restore one of our planet’s most valuable and life-giving ecosystems. Together, we can ensure that coral reefs—and the communities that depend on them—continue to thrive for generations to come."

        "content": "Nestled within the Gulf of Honduras, the Cayman Crown reef is a unique and critical component of the   system. Recently designated as a protected area, Cayman Crown boasts some of the highest coral cover within the MAR region, featuring live coral cover at an impressive 60% (Giro, 2019). This extraordinary reef serves as a central hub for marine biodiversity, connectivity, and resilience, making it vital for marine life and the surrounding communities that rely on it. The ecological significance of the Cayman Crown goes beyond its coral health. Its distinctive bathymetry supports fish spawning aggregations (FSAs), a process crucial for maintaining healthy fish populations throughout the Gulf of Honduras. With its strategic location, Cayman Crown plays a pivotal role in connecting marine species across various life stages, ensuring the continuity and health of commercially significant fish stocks (Giró, 2019; Pérez Murcia, 2020). The high biomass of fish and other species supported by this reef is essential for the livelihoods of local communities, many of whom depend on these resources for their economic well-being. With generous support from the  , through the MAR Fish Project, CORAL and MAR Fund have partnered to formally understand and mitigate the impact of the closure of the  Cayman Crown Reef as a key Fish Spawning Aggregation site. By legally protecting this reef and the livelihoods that depend on it, we are working to safeguard its biodiversity and the crucial fish stocks it supports, reducing pressures on the ecosystem and fostering sustainable fishing practices in nearby communities. This pilot project has been built upon CORAL’s ongoing efforts to support fishers and coastal communities throughout the Honduran Caribbean. Our team has accumulated a valuable socio-economic database across 33 fishing communities in the region, enabling us to develop tools that promote sustainable fisheries management and livelihood diversification strategies. These insights, combined with CORAL and MAR Fund’s establishment of a socioeconomic baseline for Honduran fishers at Cayman Crown, set a robust foundation for crafting sustainable solutions for both the reef and the communities that rely on it. One of our biggest learnings during the implementation of the project was to know the willingness of fishing communities to learn and change. The communities are understanding the importance of developing projects to diversify their livelihoods that implement sustainable practices to conserve and recover marine ecosystems. They know that the sustainable use of natural resources is a legacy that transcends generations and shapes a future in which both people and the planet can thrive. The Cayman Crown initiative is structured around strengthening local fishers by equipping them with the resources and knowledge needed to diversify their income sources beyond fishing. We recognize that effective conservation requires addressing the economic needs of local communities. To this end, our project prioritizes capacity strengthening and the development of alternative livelihoods that support both marine conservation and economic resilience. Through these focused efforts, we have successfully strengthened fishers’ associations in two key Honduran communities, equipping them with leadership skills, fund management expertise, and sustainable tourism practices. This achievement has laid the foundation for a network of legally recognized fishers’ associations, now poised to drive forward livelihood diversification strategies. By enhancing their resilience, these communities are better prepared to move beyond fishing as their only source of income. CORAL has worked hand-in-hand with local fishers to develop and launch three livelihood diversification projects, complete with technical, logistical, and financial backing. These projects are creating sustainable economic avenues that benefit both the reef ecosystem and local communities. As these initiatives take hold, fishers are transitioning to resilient economic models that promise to lessen their dependence on fishing, helping to safeguard marine biodiversity while supporting local prosperity. With transparency and community connection at our core, we’ve documented each phase of our work, sharing stories, visuals, and infographics that capture the impact of these efforts on local livelihoods and conservation. Our multi-language communication strategy—offered in English, Spanish, and Garifuna—ensures that every community member, as well as global supporters, can appreciate the meaningful outcomes of these projects. Together, through collaboration, capacity strengthening, and innovative livelihood strategies, we are working to ensure that Cayman Crown continues to thrive as a vital marine habitat—and a source of opportunity for generations to come."

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "In the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR), one of the world’s most diverse and vital reef systems, dedicated local communities, fishers, government agencies, scientists, and nonprofits are achieving measurable improvements in reef health. Although challenges remain, the recent   shows a slight yet encouraging increase in reef health across the region due to an increase in fish biomass likely resulting from improved enforcement. This marks the first reported improvement in five years, thanks largely to the collaborative conservation efforts among coastal communities and organizations like CORAL.  Our data-driven approach is supporting these communities in building lasting resilience for coral reefs and strengthening our understanding of how to manage these ecosystems effectively in the face of climate change. Using data collected from almost 300 monitoring sites spanning 1,000 kilometers and four countries, the HRI Report Card serves as a crucial health assessment for reefs in the MAR region. Data is collected using the Atlantic Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) reef monitoring methodology and assesses coral health based on four key indicators: live coral cover, fleshy macroalgal cover, herbivorous fish biomass, and commercially important fish biomass. Instead of simply reviewing the data, CORAL uses the findings to inform and adjust our strategies in ways that support and build the capacity of coastal communities. These data help us measure what’s working and what needs further action, allowing us to take targeted steps that enhance reef resilience and community benefits. The 2024 HRI report highlights improvements in herbivorous fish populations, like parrotfish and surgeonfish, in the Bay Islands of Honduras (except Guanaja), where these crucial species thrive in MPAs protected from overfishing. However, herbivore biomass dipped in coastal Honduras, where they are not yet fully safeguarded. CORAL is collaborating with the Fisheries Directorate and local partners to push for a nationwide legal decree to protect herbivorous fish across all of Honduras. By supporting community-led initiatives, sustainable fishing practices, and improved water quality, we aim to create a resilient reef ecosystem for future report cards. This connection between community-driven fisheries management and ecological resilience is at the core of CORAL’s approach. CORAL uses the findings from the HRI Report Card to validate our current strategies and refine and adapt our methods alongside our community partners.  With each report, we can track shifts in reef health, fish populations, and water quality, giving local leaders and fishers a clearer picture of the outcomes of their efforts. This insight allows us to support communities in real time, helping them implement targeted solutions proven to enhance reef health, such as expanded MPA networks and refined water treatment projects under our   initiative. For example, in 2024, Coxen Hole saw a dramatic increase in wastewater treatment investment and will continue to see more in 2025. This is desperately needed after seeing the impacts of untreated/poorly treated wastewater on the area’s beloved reef, Cordelia Banks, which was unable to recover from a devastating bleaching event. The severe mortality of this magnificent reef occurred just after the data collection period ended for this report card. The recent data underscore the impact of collaborative action and reinforce the importance of sustained community engagement and data transparency. As our understanding of these ecosystems grows, we can offer increasingly precise and effective tools to local organizations, amplifying their capacity to maintain resilient reef ecosystems. The HRI Report Card highlights the strength of collaborative conservation and informed action. By pairing community-driven MPA management with conservation science, we are creating a future where reefs and coastal communities can thrive together. The road to reef resilience is challenging, but each bit of data shows us the way forward, with communities and organizations like CORAL united in purpose and action.  With our shared dedication and a commitment to adaptive, community-led strategies, the MAR is on a promising path towards sustained reef health, biodiversity, and resilience. This year’s report encourages us all to continue strengthening these partnerships, knowing that together, we can create a future where coral reefs and the communities that depend on them can thrive side by side."

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Coral reefs are powerful yet vulnerable ecosystems, rich in biodiversity but increasingly at risk in a changing world. Here at the Coral Reef Alliance, our team advances science to assess the adaptive capacity of corals, protect diverse reef networks, and restore marine ecosystems by influencing management and policy decisions.  Through scientific research, we work to understand how coral reefs can adapt in the face of climate change and translate our findings into data-driven solutions. Coral reefs support coastal communities, act as natural barriers against storm surges, and are critical to marine biodiversity. However, they are severely threatened by pollution, unsustainable fishing, and climate change, with predictions that almost all coral reefs could be lost by 2050 if current trends continue.  CORAL recognizes that climate change is a profound challenge for reefs and that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be key to their survival.  However, though climate change is a global problem, strategic local protection is still critical to maximizing the probability of coral reef survival and recovery.    Over almost a decade of scientific research, CORAL and its partners have shown that protecting connected networks of genetically diverse reefs is critical to ensuring their survival and recovery.   Organisms with genes that are best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, sending their unique genetic code on to the next generation. This process is known as natural selection. Over multiple generations of natural selection, species can evolve, displaying new traits and characteristics. And the more genetically diverse a population of organisms is, the more likely some of those individuals will be able to adapt to whatever circumstances arise. It’s this idea that is essential to coral reefs surviving the heat stress created by climate change.  Through simulating coral reef survival under different climate scenarios, we’ve shown that genetically diverse coral reef networks are much more likely to survive warming waters than their less diverse counterparts. Our research has also found that genetic connections between coral reefs (e.g. via currents that carry coral larvae) are crucial to their prospects because genetic exchange, especially from reefs that are already adapted to high temperatures, can enhance the odds of resilience. First, we must reduce carbon emissions and slow the rate of climate change to give corals a fighting chance. Second, we must protect a diversity of reefs that are themselves genetically diverse. Doing so increases the odds that heat-adapted individuals will be present and naturally selected. Third, we can’t just protect individual patches of reef; we must ensure that reefs are protected in connected networks to allow the exchange of genes. And finally, we must pay particular attention to the presence of hot reefs in these networks, which should allow heat-adapted larvae to spread to other reefs. Despite the importance of genetic variation in coral reef resilience, approaches to reef management often fail to account for evolutionary criteria. This is because assessing coral reef genetic diversity is costly and requires expertise that many practitioners do not have available.  CORAL is working closely with partners to evaluate whether we can estimate coral reef genetic diversity and adaptive capacity from remotely sensed data. As we develop adequate proxies, we can then scale these up, creating a globally applicable tool, which we’re aiming to launch in 2025. Making this information easily and freely accessible worldwide would catalyze its incorporation into coral reef management and marine spatial planning processes as part of countries’ 30×30 commitments. Our Global Conservation Science team’s goal is to influence and leverage partners, fieldwork, and technology to drive adaptation-focused conservation solutions that will rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change.  This biodiversity hotspot is home to 76% of the world’s coral species and supports the livelihoods of millions through fishing, tourism, and coastal protection services. As part of the Climate REEFS initiative (Integrating Risks, Evolution, and socio-Economics for Fisheries Sustainability)—a multi-million dollar collaboration of partners in the USA, UK, Indonesia, and the Philippines—CORAL is working to develop techniques to identify adaptive reefs using remote sensing technologies. The ultimate goal of this effort is to develop a freely available, online tool that can identify genetically diverse reefs across the globe. In-country Climate REEFS partners hope to work with relevant government bodies in Indonesia and the Philippines to co-create revised provincial and national-level marine management plans that reflect our findings. CORAL also developed an international consortium of conservationists, ecologists, and computer scientists with a shared interest in evaluating whether we can measure coral reef diversity and adaptive capacity from space. Through examining relationships between measures of diversity (e.g. species diversity, genetic diversity, and others) and remotely sensed metrics at a series of pilot sites, this group strives to identify the best proxies for reef measures of adaptive potential—work that complements the research undertaken by Climate REEFS.  Our members’ research encompasses a range of approaches and spans three oceans: the Pacific, including sites in the North (e.g., Hawai’i, Palau, and Republic of the Marshall Islands), South (e.g., Fiji), and Indo-west Pacific (e.g., Indonesia and the Philippines), the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean (Mozambique), and the Atlantic (e.g., Honduras and the Turks and Caicos Islands). Last year, for instance, CORAL contributed to the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Target 3 Partnership Meeting in Cambridge, which aimed to coordinate implementation efforts of the Post-2020 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and build technical capacity. The guidelines developed at this meeting and ones like it will inform conservation approaches for diverse ecosystems everywhere on Earth.  CORAL has also recently been accredited by the UN Environment Programme, co-published seven high-impact scientific papers over the last seven years, and shared its findings at multiple high-profile conferences and events.  Notably, in 2023, CORAL further expanded its reach by securing two CORAL Fellows, one of whom is supporting Pacific Coral Triangle countries, based in Honiara, and one of whom is supporting Southeast Asian countries in the Coral Triangle, based in Manado at the Regional Secretariat of the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security. These locally-based consultants are contributing to a climate risk assessment for Coral Triangle reefs as well as a policy analysis that aims to inform fisheries management by reviewing gendered climate vulnerability and climate risks. By working to create readily available tools and resources that enable practitioners in under-resourced settings to incorporate genetic diversity into their coral reef conservation approaches, we’re working to improve the odds that coral reefs will survive and recover in a rapidly changing world.  Our commitment to understanding how we can help corals adapt continues to yield meaningful results. Over the last few years, we’ve successfully co-authored multiple successfully funded research projects, expanded our work to the Coral Triangle (a hub of coral reef biodiversity), and continued to form and strengthen partnerships that help us magnify our international impact. CORAL is not only working to save coral reefs but also to foster a global community united by a common goal: to protect and restore one of our planet’s most valuable and life-giving ecosystems. Together, we can ensure coral reefs—and the communities that depend on them—continue to thrive for generations to come."

        "content": "New Executive Director   is making a splash in the world of marine conservation through her leadership at CORAL and immense dedication to saving the world’s coral reefs.  When she’s not rereading “Lord of the Rings” or rooting for her favorite college basketball team, Starck is scuba diving to some of the world’s most valuable coral reef ecosystems and strategizing on the best ways to protect them.  We had a chance to sit down with Starck to learn more about her passion for saving coral reefs and how she will continue to propel CORAL forward through effective conservation strategies, investment in science, community engagement, and impactful partnerships. Here’s what she had to say:  I spent a great deal of time as a child outside exploring and finding wonder in the world around me. In high school, I took my first trip to Andros in the Bahamas and I never looked back. As soon as I was able to get SCUBA certified and spend time exploring our underwater world, I realized I had to get involved in helping to protect it. We are all inextricably connected. Our fates are intertwined. I want a healthy thriving planet for my family and for us all, and that is only possible with healthy coral reefs!    My favorite reef experience was probably the first time I went diving in Cozumel, Mexico. It was in the late 90’s and I remember experiencing the incredible diversity of corals and fish that I had never seen before. The drift dives there allow you to just float and watch this amazing world go by as if you are flying. I remember watching a yellowhead jawfish carefully carrying shells and small rocks in its mouth to arrange its burrow. This was also the first time I saw a parrotfish sleeping in its cocoon “sleeping bag” of mucus at night. I remember thinking how busy the coral reef was and how all of the organisms seemed to be working together in harmony, all with a purpose. It made one feel small but also somehow connected. It was the first time I felt like I understood how we are all interconnected.   I could not be more thrilled to join the CORAL team. The staff, board, council members, partners, donors, and volunteers are some of the most passionate and inspiring people I have ever met. Our science is innovative and important to leading us to our conservation.  Our program staff understand how to put communities first and build trust through relationships. I am excited to make a difference, our work is important, urgent, and our team is up for the challenge. Each and every team member is fabulous!   I have continued to learn and grow as a leader over the years. I would describe myself as someone with a high level of self-awareness that works hard to be honest, transparent, vulnerable, and build and maintain connections. I prioritize being present, participating, guiding, mentoring, and coaching our team to be efficient and effective. I enjoy pushing our strategy forward to reach our mission and ensuring that our team has the resources they need to move past any obstacle. Ensuring that everyone can come to work each day as their entire authentic selves as well as set boundaries for a healthy balance for their specific work/life situation is something I also care deeply about as a leader.  I am committed to our mission, it is deeply personal to me. I am also committed to relationships with you as partners and supporters. I come from a huge family, I have 8 siblings and 31 nieces and nephews. Family is everything to me. I look forward to getting to know all of my CORAL “family”.  Conservation is about people and building relationships. We need to work on solutions that are built from listening to the communities that have lived and thrived there for multiple generations. They have a deep connection with their surroundings and understand the problems and solutions better than anyone. Conservation works best when we listen, learn, and work together on solutions that will benefit both people and the natural world as we are all connected. This sounds simple, yet I have seen so many projects fail by not doing this well.   As the staff, board, partners, volunteers, and I continue to move forward, we will be looking for opportunities to take the lessons we have learned and drive action. Our strategy of working at the local, regional, and global scale will remain important. We have learned quite a bit about what works and doesn’t work in coral reef conservation in communities and our science is giving us more information and planning tools. Moving forward, we will need to focus even more on the “alliance” in our name to ensure that what we have learned that works is being utilized in as many places as possible through partnerships and coalitions. "

        "content": "Over 20 tons of sediment has been captured in the mountains above Lahaina, the result of a collaborative restoration project led by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL). West Maui is laden with historic sugarcane and pineapple plantations that are now out-of-use. During heavy rain events, the potentially contaminated soil from these degraded landscapes travels down old dirt roads, enters stream gulches, and ultimately reaches the ocean where it  . CORAL uses native plants—and over 100 supportive volunteers—to   and trap the sediment before it has a chance to runoff into the ocean. “This past year alone, our restoration projects have trapped over 20 tons of sediment that would have ultimately ended up on our coral reefs,” says Jen Vander Veur, CORAL’s Senior Program Manager on Maui. “That’s the equivalent weight of 10 cars. It’s so great seeing all of our hard work pay off.” And that’s just the beginning—as the plants grow and the sediment traps continue to accumulate materials, their efficiency will grow. “Ultimately, as our traps collect sediment, that sediment will fill in openings and slow the stormwater even further, trapping more sediment, and so on and so on,” says Vander Veur. “And the more sediment we can keep off of Maui’s reefs the better.” Most   are hosts to zooxanthellae, tiny algae with which they share  . Corals provide the algae with protected environments, and in exchange, the algae use the sun to photosynthesize and produce oxygen, and help the corals remove waste. When sediment is dumped on a coral, it blocks out the necessary sunlight to support this process and corals ultimately die. West Maui’s coral reefs are important sources of coral larvae that replenish reefs across Maui, Lanai and Molokai. Because of this, the area has been designated a priority conservation site by the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force and the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources. But a 2012 Wahikuli-Honokowai Watershed Management Plan prepared for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program identified erosion from degraded agricultural lands as a major threat to these vital coral reef ecosystems. Funded in part by the Hawai‘i Department of Health, CORAL’s program is part of   who are working to restore these lands and stabilize the slope. “It’s great that there is such strong community and governmental support to protect these reefs,” says Vander Veur. “Even with COVID putting a pause to our in-person volunteer planting days, our volunteers have continued to keep this project moving forward. Over 100 volunteers are growing native plants from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that number continues to grow. Once grown, volunteers drop their plants off at a greenhouse space donated to CORAL by Pacific Biodiesel, where they stay until they are ultimately planted at the restoration sites. Volunteers interested in helping with this project should contact Larissa Treese at  ."

        "content": "A new dataset, made public this month by Hawai’i Wai Ola, gives community members access to high quality, open-source water quality testing data dating back to June of 2020. Volunteers and members of  —a local community hui founded by the   to improve water quality—have taken monthly water quality samples at popular sites around Hawai’i Island, including Kahalu’u Bay, Richardson Beach Park, Carlsmith Beach Park, Puhi Bay Beach, Reeds Bay Beach and Moku Ola Beach. The new dataset includes metrics from these locations on pH, salinity, temperature, turbidity, nutrients and enterococcus levels—commonly used indicators of sewage pollution in nearshore ocean environments.  “The fact that we have this data set is incredibly exciting,” says Erica Perez, senior program manager at the Coral Reef Alliance and founding member of Hawai’i Wai Ola. “These are sites that aren’t tested by the Department of Health (DOH), so this is the first time this information is being made available to people.”  While DOH regularly tracks water quality throughout the state, their resources are limited and as a result, there are critical knowledge gaps in the information they collect.  “DOH can’t take action to address poor water quality if they don’t know when the water quality is poor,” says Perez. “The purpose of our program at Hawai’i Wai Ola is to empower local communities to work alongside DOH and help expand their understanding of ocean water quality and overcome their resource barriers.” For example, this new data shows several beaches have experienced unhealthy enterococcus levels over the last year and a half. Richardson Beach Park measured 1119 CFU per 100 mL in August of 2020—that’s nearly nine times higher than the levels considered healthy by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Hawai’i Department of Health issues an alert for any area experiencing levels of 104 CFU per 100 mL or above for a single sample.  But Perez warns that it’s important not to jump to conclusions when noticing one-off data points like this, and instead to focus on the fact that the community near Richardson Beach Park can now work with DOH to identify if there’s a bigger problem and find a resolution.  “These are one-time sampling events that happen once a month, so they don’t necessarily give the full story,” says Perez. “Enterococcus levels can change rapidly based on tides, currents, weather events, etc. It could rain and cesspools could leach into the groundwater and into the shoreline, and then it could be gone the next day. So these levels aren’t always an indicator of an ongoing problem.”  The hui is working with the community to ensure they know about this new resource and they have shared the dataset with DOH so they can conduct a more thorough analysis. This new knowledge will be included in DOH’s bi-annual ocean beach health report that they use to identify areas of concern and strategize.  The whole program and the fact that this data now exists highlights the power of citizen science networks, says Manuel Mejia, the Hawai’i regional program director for the Coral Reef Alliance. Hawai’i Wai Ola and the Coral Reef Alliance are working to train community volunteers to collect water quality samples following DOH protocols. Volunteers will then bring the samples to a water quality lab in Kona for analysis.  “We can’t manage what we can’t measure,” says Mejia. “But we can give communities the tools they need to start measuring, and to advocate for an improvement in water quality which is so desperately needed across our islands. Allowing local communities to have more ownership over their resources and to have a say over how they’re utilized is invaluable.”  The new dataset can be viewed online at hawaiiwaiola.com/data.   The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is committed to saving the world’s coral reefs. The nonprofit organization works at local, regional and global levels to keep coral reefs healthy so they can adapt to climate change and survive for generations to come.

Launched on the eve of the Our Ocean Conference in Palau,   is a user-friendly, open-access platform poised to revolutionize global coral reef monitoring and management by allowing the world’s coral reef monitoring community to work together, in real time. ReefCloud standardizes data collected from around the world, analyzing coral reef composition with 80-90 percent accuracy, 700 times faster than traditional manual assessment, saving weeks and months of labour and freeing precious reef management resources. It was developed by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in collaboration with Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Fiji, the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), University of South Pacific, Queensland University of Technology, Marine Ecology Consulting, Maldives Marine Research Institute and CO2 Consulting, with in kind support from Accenture, Speaking at the launch at PICRC, Australian Ambassador for the Environment Jamie Isbister said ReefCloud brought a transformative change to the way we monitored our coral reefs and came at a critical time for global reef protection. It also included engagement with indigenous communities, many of whom play a key role in marine monitoring. “Coral reefs are rapidly declining, with climate change being their single greatest threat globally,” Mr Isbister said. “This platform is going to address key challenges by helping coral reef managers assess the condition of their reefs and take appropriate management actions.” AIMS Research Team Lead and ReefCloud Director Dr Manuel Gonzalez Rivero said ReefCloud was the “democratization of knowledge”. “We’re partnering with the   to support a transformation in coral reef monitoring,” he said.  “Last year, GCRMN released a   which involved integrating reef monitoring efforts from 12,000 coral reef sites in 73 countries. With limited human resources it took years to painstakingly reconcile inconsistent data formats and methodologies. ReefCloud can automate that process, providing up-to-date information within hours, which leads to more timely and informed decisions on actions to improve the long-term sustainability of our coral reefs.” ReefCloud is a A$6.6M program, jointly funded by AIMS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).

        "content": "A   shows that a popular coral restoration technique is unlikely to protect coral reefs from climate change, and is based on the assumption that local threats to reefs are managed effectively. The research, published in the  , used innovative models to explore the response of coral reefs to restoration projects that propagate corals and outplant them into the wild. Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of outplanting corals genetically adapted to warmer temperatures, sometimes called ‘super corals,’ to reefs experiencing climate change as a way to build resilience to warming. The models found that neither approach was successful at preventing a decline in coral coverage in the next several hundred years due to climate change, and that selectively breeding corals to be more heat tolerant will only lead to benefits if conducted at a very large scale over the course of centuries. Even then, benefits won’t be realized for 200 years. Restoring areas with corals that haven’t been selected to be more heat tolerant was ineffective at helping corals survive climate change except at the largest supplementation levels explored. “The scenarios where coral reefs showed the greatest resilience to climate change were those where natural genetic variance was highest, and outplanting heat-tolerant corals in those areas had little to no effect on outcomes,” says Dr. Lukas DeFilippo, who co-led this research as a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington, and is now a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  “Our previous research shows that corals have the best chance of adapting to the effects of climate change, like warming ocean temperatures, if there is high genetic diversity and if habitat is protected from other local stressors.” says Dr. Lisa McManus, the other co-lead, who conducted this work as a postdoctoral researcher  at Rutgers University and is now faculty at the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology. “Repopulating a coral reef with corals that have similar genetic makeups could reduce an area’s natural genetic diversity, and therefore make it harder for all corals to adapt to climate change.”  Coral reef restoration techniques are widely applied throughout the world as a way to repopulate degraded coral reef areas. Though the practice has some benefits, like engaging and educating communities about reef ecosystems, or replenishing a coral reef population after an area has been hit by a storm or suffered direct physical damage, more scientists are speaking up about the limitations of conservation approaches that focus solely on restoration.  “There’s a time and place for coral restoration, but ultimately, restoration alone likely won’t save coral reefs from warming waters for the foreseeable future,” says Dr. Helen Fox, one of the co-authors on this study and the conservation science director at the Coral Reef Alliance. Fox’s doctoral research focused on coral restoration and she is one of few early researchers to have studied its cost effectiveness and long-term success rate. “For starters, if we don’t also address local threats to reefs, like poor water quality and overfishing, then any corals that are outplanted may also eventually die.” The paper’s authors agree that focusing solely on coral restoration and genetically engineering corals to be more tolerant of high temperatures is risky. Our understanding of the genes that determine heat resistance is limited, and focusing on reproducing just one single trait could undermine a coral’s resilience to other stressors or its natural ability to adapt.  Restoration practices also carry a hefty price tag and require a lot of resources. The median cost of restoring just one hectare (or about 2.5 acres) of coral reef has been estimated at over $350,000, and that’s not factoring in the high mortality rates that often come with such projects and the cost of genetically modifying corals.  “My biggest takeaway from this study is that the scale at which restoration would need to be done is so large that we instead give corals a better chance of surviving climate change with reef management strategies that focus on promoting natural genetic variance,” says Dr. Madhavi Colton, another co-author on the paper and the executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “This means keeping corals healthy by creating and managing marine protected area networks, reducing pollution through better wastewater treatment, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” This study was the result of a collaborative effort between the Coral Reef Alliance, University of Washington, Rutgers University, Stanford University, University of Queensland, University of Hawai’i, and The Nature Conservancy; funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and The Nature Conservancy. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is committed to saving the world’s coral reefs. The nonprofit organization works at local, regional and global levels to keep coral reefs healthy so they can adapt to climate change and survive for generations to come.

She also previously held the role of executive director for Audubon North Carolina and sat on the National Audubon Society’s Climate Cabinet, acting as a leader for environmental conservation. “The underwater world is what led me to conservation,” says Starck about her decision to join CORAL. In addition to more than 20 years of experience in nonprofit conservation management, Starck brings both a background in marine biology and an incredible enthusiasm for CORAL’s mission to save the world’s coral reefs.“Somewhere in the suspended water and time floating along a reef is where I am most at peace. CORAL’s mission, to save the world’s coral reefs, is one that I can bring my entire personal and professional passion and expertise to support.” Though coral reefs only encompass less than one percent of the earth’s surface, they are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet. They are home to 25 percent of all marine life and support over 500 million people with food, income and coastal protection. They are also one of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet, contributing more than $375 billion in services each year.  But the threats to coral reefs continue to mount, and today nearly 75 percent of all coral reefs are threatened by climate change and localized human activities. Scientists predict that 99 percent of coral reefs will be lost by the end of this century without concerted efforts to protect them.  CORAL works through community partnerships to keep coral reefs healthy throughout Hawaii and the Mesoamerican region, and spearheads global conservation science and collaborations to focus attention on what corals need in order to adapt to future climate conditions.

The recent study, published in the journal  , finds that coral reefs can evolve and adapt to the effects of climate change—but only if we protect a sufficient diversity of coral reefs, particularly when it comes to temperatures.  “Evolution happens when corals that have already adapted to new environmental conditions breed with corals that have not yet adapted,” said Malin Pinsky, associate professor at Rutgers and a coauthor of the study. “As ocean temperatures rise, we need to keep corals in hotter waters healthy and protected so they can reproduce and spread their heat tolerance to other coral reef areas.”  The study advocates for a conservation approach that protects coral reefs at local, regional and global scales, in a way that allows heat tolerance to spread.  The authors of the study said if humanity takes rapid and effective action to keep coral reefs healthy at local scales and addresses climate change, coral reef ecosystems may recover over the next century and thrive in the future.   “The best part about these results are that they underscore the importance of our actions at local scales—we don’t have to just sit back and watch coral reefs suffer as our climate changes,” said Madhavi Colton, lead author of the study and former executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “This study provides guidance on how to design local conservation solutions that will have real, lasting impacts well into the future.”  Coral reefs cover less than one percent of the earth’s surface, but they are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet.

        "content": "Coral reefs face a difficult and uncertain future. According to a  , the Earth is currently on track to warm by 2.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, enough to wipe out 99% of reefs. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% in the next seven years to avoid this catastrophe. Meanwhile, local threats like pollution and overfishing, also pose serious challenges. Luckily, there are ways we can protect coral reefs AND address the climate crisis simultaneously. Here are three promising solutions:  A remarkable   come from agriculture and land use. In fact, improving our land management strategies could achieve the same effect as decarbonizing all transportation across the globe, removing   as of 2021.  Of all land-use emissions, half result from deforestation. Forests act as effective carbon sinks, capturing CO  from the air and using it to build new plant tissue through photosynthesis. However, when trees are removed or burnt, often to make way for new agricultural lands, the carbon they store is released back into the atmosphere. Traditional agriculture brings other woes as well, including excessive use of fertilizer and increased rates of erosion. During heavy rain events, nutrients and loose sediment can be carried to waterways and oceans where they have serious negative impacts on coral reefs.   kills reefs by covering them and blocking the sunlight they need to photosynthesize. Nutrients, including those often found in fertilizer runoff, promote the growth of algae that may kill and displace corals entirely.  Fortunately, innovative land-use practices offer a greener and more reef-friendly path forward. The widespread use of   alone, for instance, could reduce the expected amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by up to 23.94 gigatons. As we’ve learned from our work on  , restoring and reforesting abandoned farmlands can also be effective in reducing sediment runoff to nearby reefs and reviving native ecosystems. While protecting ocean habitats and reducing emissions might not seem to go hand-in-hand, marine protected areas (MPAs) can actually have remarkable benefits for the climate as well as wildlife and coastal communities. For coral reefs, well-protected MPAs can prevent exposure to damaging fishing practices, facilitate the rebound of key fish species that keep reefs healthy, provide potential income to communities, increase fish catch, and more.  Lesser known are the benefits that marine protected areas can have for the climate, particularly through protecting seagrass and mangrove ecosystems. Seagrass meadows and mangrove forests are amazingly effective when it comes to sequestering carbon. Seagrasses constitute less than 0.1% of the global marine environment but, through trapping dead roots, leaves, and organic matter, bury 10% of ocean sediment-based carbon in their deep soils. Mangroves contribute disproportionately as well, occupying just 2% of marine environments but sequestering 14% of ocean carbon.  Seagrasses and native mangroves are also critical to coral reef health. Both are found in conjunction with reefs, providing critical nursery habitats for juvenile fish and improving water quality through trapping sediment and other pollutants. On the island of Roatán in the Bay Islands of Honduras, our partners at the Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA) are actively replanting mangroves, restoring the crucial ecosystem services these forests provide.   Arguably the most infamous form of marine pollution, plastics constitute   for coral reefs and marine life.   estimated that 11.1 billion plastic items were entangled across reefs in the Asia-Pacific region alone. That same study also concluded that corals in contact with these plastics experienced an 85% increase in likelihood of disease. Microplastics, microscopic plastic particles produced by the decay of larger pieces of plastic material, can abrade corals, impede their ability to feed, and make infection more likely. Plastics also pose serious issues for the many animals that call coral reefs home. They are also terrible for the climate. Many plastics are made from fossil fuels and petrochemicals. From the extraction and transport of the materials necessary for plastic production, to manufacturing, to incineration, the plastic creation process is fossil-fuel intensive across all stages of production. There is even some preliminary evidence to suggest that plastics in the environment   (both greenhouse gasses) into the atmosphere as they decompose. A transition away from these materials would both dramatically curtail emissions over time and begin to address the severe issues posed to coral reefs by marine debris. To this end, CORAL is   tourists and the tourism industry on the dangers of plastic pollution and other coral reef threats.  From urban planning, to carpooling, to forest protection, there are a wide range of creative solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

        "content": "Coral reefs are important because they can prevent many things from happening and they can do many things. One thing is that they give animals a home. One of every four marine animals lives in coral reefs. Clownfish, giant clams, turtles, and many different kinds of fish call coral reefs home. Corals help the animals hide from predators and get food. A fun fact about clownfish in coral is that clownfish are really colorful so that they can blend in with the coral. In addition to helping the animals, corals help protect islands from big waves that are coming to destroy, attack, and erode the island.  But coral reefs are bleaching because of human activity, warming oceans, and greenhouse gasses. One of the causes is pollution, such as fertilizers, pesticides, human sewage, oil spills, and oil drills. Greenhouse gasses, like carbon dioxide, are another cause. When carbon dioxide mixes with saltwater it creates acid. Acid helps the corals bleach, which is not helpful. Greenhouse gasses also cause global warming. Global warming causes glaciers and icebergs to melt into the ocean and then the ocean rises. Corals can’t grow because they don’t get enough sunlight. Coral reefs are also bleaching because of global warming and the ocean is getting too hot. Rising temperatures of the water slow down the growing of the coral. Another way the coral is bleaching is because the algae leaves the coral when the water gets too hot and this can kill the coral.  We need to start protecting our coral reefs because it’s now or never. If the coral bleaches, then the reef goes. If the reef goes, then the animals go. If the animals go, then the ocean goes. If the ocean goes, then the planet isn’t a planet. It creates this whole chain.  If you do these things, we can help save the coral reefs. If you are like me, a person who is very sad about coral reefs bleaching, don’t be sad. We can always fix it. We can always make speeches and signs and go protest. We can also   that do research on coral reefs like the Coral Reef Alliance. If we do all of this, then our planet isn’t destroyed and we can save our Planet Earth, our home where we live. "

        "content": "Each year,   It’s a great cause and an important step—but this year, let’s take it even further and consider moving away from single-use plastic altogether. When plastic makes its way to the ocean, it also finds a home in coral reefs, causing serious problems for these elaborate structures of the sea. The world’s coral reefs are home to some of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, supporting over 4,000 types of fish, and over a million aquatic species depend on reefs at some point in their lives. The good news is   Remember, everything leads to the ocean, so being mindful of how often you purchase, use, and discard plastic is key. What we consume on land, no matter how well it’s discarded can easily find its way to waterways where it can harm fish, birds, coral reefs and so much more.   You can use your voice to advocate for change, make a personal decision to decrease plastic usage, and educate others on the amount of waste that harms our coral reefs and the planet at large. How gut-wrenching are these photos?   Plastic entangles wildlife, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers over seven million square miles and is clouded with micro-plastics, and beaches are constantly littered with trash no matter how many cleanups are carried out. But what we see here is barely scratching the surface of the damage being done to our oceans. Plastic makes up about  , and millions of tons of it wind up in our oceans each year.  gave us a better understanding of the impact of all that plastic on reefs in particular. Researchers studied 159 coral reefs in Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Myanmar, and discovered that   Floating bits of plastic block out sunlight, spread pathogens, and cut into corals, making them more susceptible to infection.  This is likely thanks to more vigorous waste management systems compared to other surveyed regions as well as the reefs being much further off shore.  From warming temperatures and rising sea levels to extreme weather and ocean acidification, every resident of the ocean is adapting to these changes to their environment or perishing in its wake.  The scary part? These effects will worsen year over year without some serious climate action, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable. This is especially concerning as a quarter of all marine life depends on their survival. In 2016, over half of all coral reefs faced extreme heat stress, and   was killed. From 2014 to 2017, 75% of the world’s coral reefs faced bleaching-level heat. Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed, most often when ocean water gets too warm. Corals will “eject” the symbiotic algae (called zooxanthellae) that live inside them. When corals lose their algae, they not only lose their color (turning white) but also their built-in food source. Research shows that   if they are healthy. That requires us   (i.e. keeping waste out of the ocean) and it requires us to slow the rate of our emissions. As we use and purchase more plastic, we continue to contribute to this cycle of fossil fuels and climate change. Consider a single-use plastic water bottle: when something like a plastic bottle is used once and then tossed, not only does it clog our oceans and become a threat to sea life, but its short lifespan also means producers are pumping more carbon into the atmosphere to meet those single-use needs.   You can start by incorporating small changes into your life. After all, each step toward more sustainable habits is a step toward a healthier planet. But that’s not the whole story. To take it a step further, we all need to advocate for change at a higher level. Let’s first talk about  .  ! Shop at grocery stores with bulk bins, and bring your own reusable bags and containers to fill. Avoid purchasing items that are wrapped in unnecessary plastic packaging. Bring your own to-go containers to restaurants. Try to repair something that’s broken rather than replacing it. Beyond the grocery aisle,  . Push for policies that limit waste, ban single-use plastics, and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Use your voice as a voter to sign petitions. Let your government representatives know you care by writing letters and making phone calls.   to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and reduce the impact of their production and packaging. And finally,  . Help change the culture of consumerism by using your voice and sharing your story on social media and in social circles. Use hashtags like #breakfreefromplastic and share stories about why you’re working so hard to protect our planet. The more we talk about environmental issues, the more we normalize them. And these ideas are certainly worth normalizing."

This is what artist   sees as she masterfully paints a euphoric underwater world of untouched corals in her latest series “ ,” on display at   in Hudson, NY.  We have proudly partnered with Caldwell Gallery Hudson, as they support Kovalenko’s creative message about coral reef conservation by graciously donating 20 percent of exhibition sales to CORAL.  Kovalenko is a born artist—inspired at a young age by her parents who are also artists in Moscow, Russia. Instead of toys, she played with pastel chalk and cut-out characters her mother drew. At the age of ten, she began her professional art education and later went on to study and work internationally.  After spending time abroad, she was inspired to move away from traditional painting. She now calls herself an environmental artist, covering anything from logged trees in the Amazon Rainforest to the burning of ivory tusks in Africa. In 2019, she went backpacking through South America, where she obtained her diving certification and began exploring the underwater world. Out of all the ocean creatures, she was most drawn to corals—saying “they are the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”  In “Utopian Reefscapes,” Kovalenko paints idealized coral reefs, while utilizing both her imagination and different elements of her underwater photographs. Her mission is to create scenery of abundant, untouched reefs in order to inspire viewers to take better care of the ocean. “Coral reefs are being destroyed because of global warming and other  ,” said Kovalenko. “I want to show all the beauty worth saving.”  Kovalenko also played a role in inspiring gallery owner Jay Caldwell to create something special at Caldwell Gallery Hudson. After forming a friendship several years back, the two exchanged ideas about a novel approach to art-driven philanthropy. Now twice a year, Caldwell Gallery Hudson sponsors exhibitions that empower artists whose work pertains to social or environmental issues. For these exhibitions, Caldwell shifts from the industry standard 50/50 artist-gallery split and offers the artist 60 percent of the commission. He then donates half of the gallery’s 40 percent to a nonprofit organization in the artist’s chosen field. Additionally, Caldwell Gallery Hudson hosts the artist’s residency, resulting in a new piece of art that is raffled off. One hundred percent of the money earned from the raffle tickets also goes to the nonprofit. “It’s an opportunity to dig in a little deeper and help in a direct, tangible way,” says Caldwell. Throughout Kovalenko’s exhibition, Caldwell expanded his knowledge and interest in coral reef conservation and has enjoyed passing this inspiration on to gallery visitors.  Like Caldwell and Kovalenko, we are excited to express our shared passion for protecting coral reefs with the art community. Historically, art has been a very powerful tool and can impact how people see or understand a situation. “Visual messages can really bring it home for many people,” says Kovalenko.  Through this new partnership, we aim to make reefs as healthy as they appear in Kovalenko’s paintings. After all, coral reefs provide a home to more than a million species and contribute food and income to coastal communities. They are an ecosystem worth fighting for—because as Kovalenko says, “Coral reefs are the lungs of our planet.”"

It started back in 2010, when founders and college friends Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman met two Costa Rican artisans who were struggling to make ends meet. To help, they purchased and resold 400 handcrafted bracelets, later turning the sale into a mission-driven business. The company now supports local artisans around the world, while also making conscious efforts to protect the environment.   They were particularly drawn to CORAL’s mission to save coral reefs—an ecosystem that supports more than a million marine species and countless coastal communities with food and income. Pura Vida recognizes the vital importance of protecting the ocean and emulates the essence of beach culture in their products. “[Our customers] care deeply and passionately about protecting the things that they love,” says Vanessa Skaggs, Marketing Manager for Pura Vida. And by working with CORAL, Pura Vida’s community is able to see the direct impact their purchases have on coral reefs, coastal communities, and marine life. To support our mission, Pura Vida created a special   pack, with five percent of sales going directly to CORAL. They worked with Andrea Hannemann, who is better known to her 1.3 million followers as  , to design the pack. Living in Hawai‘i, Hannemann is part of a community that relies deeply on coral reefs and the benefits they provide.  We are thrilled to team up with strong voices, like Pura Vida and Hannemann, to spread the message of why it’s so important to protect coral reefs.  Pura Vida demonstrates corporate responsibility by donating CORAL, offsetting carbon emissions, utilizing biodegradable packaging, and supporting local communities with sustainable jobs. Like us, the company hopes to inspire others to prioritize environmental protection, especially when it comes to an ecosystem as valuable as coral reefs. “My hope is that more people will become conscious consumers and realize the impact—that they might not recognize they’re having—on the oceans directly,” says Skaggs. "

His experiences are vast, ranging from diving with bull sharks to living on a tropical island in Southeast Asia. Through GILI Sports, he has been able to share his love of the water and use the business as a platform to advocate for a healthy ocean. “As a diver, I hate seeing bleached reefs,” says Regan. “[Coral reefs] are ecosystems for the millions of fish we have in the world.” According to Regan,   and direct impact on key reef ecosystems is what inspired him to give to our coral reef programs.  “I feel like we’re doing something good and also providing a really great product for people to use.” In fact, many of GILI’s customers strongly resonate with the company’s charitable mission and the fact that they can have a direct impact when purchasing a paddle board. To support coral reef conservation, GILI Sports designed a special   paddle board and donates a portion of its sales to CORAL. And as an added bonus, Regan is maximizing the company’s impact this year by contributing to CORAL’s Earth Day campaign.  GILI has generously agreed to match up to $15,000 of donations made between now and Earth Day, on April 22, 2022. This incredible contribution will go toward projects that manage wastewater pollution, support healthy fisheries, invest in cutting-edge science, and other initiatives that contribute to coral reef health.  There are many ways adventure sports companies, like GILI Sports, can support the environment in meaningful ways. Regan suggests anything from organizing beach clean-ups to using recycled materials to simply finding initiatives that resonate with your customer-base.  “I always look at what’s sustainable,” says Regan. By creating a charitable component at GILI, it allows for a bigger overall impact that can continue for years to come.  We applaud GILI Sports and its founder, who are doing what they can to repopulate important marine species, revive our valuable coral reef ecosystems, and ultimately keep our oceans—and planet—healthy. "

While she was working in the entertainment industry, Maran was constantly told that high-performance skincare and makeup products could not be healthy too.   “That simply didn’t sit well with my spirit,” says Maran. “I decided to challenge myself and be the person to crack the code and create beauty formulas that won’t compromise on your health and our planet’s health.”  Since 2007, the Josie Maran brand has championed the idea of “clean beauty,” utilizing responsibly sourced and meticulously crafted formulas made from pure argan oil, pink algae, and hemp.  Inspired by the power of nature’s ingredients, Maran decided to dedicate a portion of the company’s sales to save coral reefs. In addition to gifts made on Giving Tuesday and an Earth Week challenge, the company generously donated 10 percent of sales made from their limited-edition  to our conservation programs.  “CORAL is guided by community, leadership, and activism—and they combine all three to find scalable solutions to an environmental issue that affects us all,” says Maran. “Their mission is really aligned with our own company mission—to leave this world better than we found it.” According to Maran, “clean and green” is becoming a new norm in the beauty industry and she is proud to have been an early advocate of skincare solutions that do right by the planet. She is also thrilled to partner with CORAL, where her brand can protect our planet’s colorful marine ecosystems and support countless animals and coastal communities.  “The more we work together, the greater the change we can make,” says Maran. “We [Josie Maran] are committed to continuing to learn from sustainability leaders across all businesses to evolve how we renew our dedication to the planet.”"

It’s a fact that our partner,  , is working to change as they proudly aid some of the planet’s most pressing ocean-related missions and help us keep coral reefs healthy. Across the globe, 10% for the Ocean is working with 56 organizations from 15 different countries to support projects that improve overall ocean health. We’ve partnered with them since 2020 and are grateful to receive their financial support to  . We had a chance to chat with Aparna Sood, the project manager for 10% for the Ocean, to learn more about the institution’s passion for saving the world’s coral reefs. Here’s what she had to say:  Our ultimate aspiration is to deliver a superfund that addresses the crisis in ocean funding; an all ocean cause agnostic fund which will accelerate a low-carbon future, providing food security, supporting livelihoods, and enabling sustainable ocean economies to thrive. We will market the plight of the ocean and promote our solution for everyday people and businesses to drive a “blue recovery.” Advertising the scale of the ocean’s need is the only way to drive in vast sums of money and enable the harnessing of both consumer, corporate, state, and foundation money. This coordinated fundraising has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply. The organizations are chosen if their projects are aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Under Water). We’ll consider funding an organization working toward this goal and if its projects fall under education, research, infrastructure, or legal advocacy. We support a wide range of causes like overfishing, pollution, acidification, marine protected area protection, and coral reef conservation.  CORAL’s programs benefit   through   and protect coral reefs from pollution and the effects of climate change. Coral reefs harbor over 25% of marine species and are key to sustainable biodiversity. It’s a long journey, but it will have a huge impact on ocean health. 10% for the Ocean is proud to share CORAL’s vision to make a difference in the ocean world.  : To empower people and businesses to bring the ocean to the forefront of consumer behavior and national mandates, we first need to share the need for ocean conservation. 10% for the Ocean hopes to progress toward its vision of shifting the needle of philanthropic funding towards the ocean from less than 1% to 10% by 2030. A hugely ambitious, yet absolutely essential goal. "

You are surrounded by nature in its purest form and accompanied by generations of community members who’ve come to be immersed in the local culture and tradition.  This special place is what the   organization sees when they envision a future for the Olowalu Valley, an important ecological and cultural site found in West Maui, Hawai‘i. We are proud to partner with Kipuka Olowalu and support their vision to revitalize the valley, preserve its native culture, and save the nearby coral reefs.  The Olowalu Cultural Reserve was reorganized as Kipuka Olowalu in 2020 with a broad mission to cultivate environmental and cultural connectivity and perpetuate traditional Hawaiian values. The group focuses on preserving a 75 acre reserve by minimizing invasive species and restoring the land with native plants.  Even though the work is done on land, it expands as far as the ocean. According to Karin Osuga, Kipuka Olowalu’s executive director, the stream that runs through the reserve flows from the base of the mountains to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean. Its water empties directly onto Olowalu’s coral reefs, which act as an important source of larvae for other reefs throughout Maui Nui.  “In Hawai‘i, there is an understanding that whatever we do on land will impact what is going on in the ocean,” says Osuga. “We want to be responsible in both our land and ocean stewardship so everything is in balance.” Our partnership with Kipuka Olowalu started about a year ago, and ever since we have been working together to expand the organization’s capacity and implement a mauka to makai (ridge-to-reef) approach to save coral reefs in Olowalu. Kipuka Olowalu is bringing together community members and organizational representatives from the region to collaborate on their initiatives and develop a formalized action plan to restore the valley. As part of our partnership, CORAL team members will advise the group on actions that will preserve the area’s coral reefs.  Since working with Kipuka Olowalu, Osuga has noticed new life come back to the valley. “Native plants popped up, the bees came back, and dragonflies showed up,” she says. “This quiet space that hadn’t been actively cared for in a while was suddenly buzzing with life.” By preserving the environment in its original state, we can also preserve the knowledge and stories about land and ocean that Hawaiian ancestors have passed down for generations. “In the Hawaiian worldview, there are so many reasons why coral reefs matter. It’s food, it’s culture, it’s recreation, it’s medicine—all of these things are important,” says Osuga. “We should take care of coral reefs because it’s the right thing to do.”"

        "content": "Born in the Philippines and long-time resident of Hawai‘i, Manuel Mejia, our Hawai‘i Regional Program Director, harvests a deep passion for coral reefs and our need to protect them. We recently had the opportunity to sit down with him and dive in to this passion a little more.   A: I’ve loved the ocean since my childhood. I grew up in the Philippines, a beautiful archipelago, and the island communities there depend a lot on marine resources and the ocean. Growing up, my family would go to the ocean for peace and relaxation and that has stayed with me throughout my life. As a teenager, I learned to sail in the Chesapeake Bay. And as an adult, I was fortunate enough to sail on Hokule‘a as crew and science specialist for the Polynesian Voyaging Society’s Worldwide Voyage. When I’m in the ocean, I feel calm and really connected with life and all its wonders. I just find the ocean to be a source of life and inspiration, and I count myself very lucky to have built a meaningful career based on conservation and getting to work with communities to protect our oceans.   A: My parents taught me how to care for coral reefs and respect people and nature. They introduced me to the wonders of this world. For all their importance and beauty, however, coral reefs are often unseen and undervalued even though they are immensely important to humanity. A lot of our food, medicines and recreation come from the ocean. Working across the Pacific with many communities, from Fiji to the Philippines and Indonesia, and here in Hawai‘i, I’ve really learned how important coral reefs are to people’s wellbeing—not just for physical sustenance, but for cultural and spiritual wellbeing, too.   A: Across the Pacific, there’s this caring for the ocean like it’s family, and I see that especially strong here in Hawai‘i. Bioculturally, coral reefs are foundational in Hawai‘i. There is an  , or Hawaiian proverb, that says  , which means “though the sea be deep and rough, the coral rock remains standing.” It’s often said of people or communities who remain calm and persevere through difficult times. And to me, this resilience describes the communities in Hawai‘i that continue traditions of adaptive management and caring for reefs so that they can continue to rely on and take care of their families. There is this beautiful reciprocity between people and the ocean and that inspires me to help carry out our mission at CORAL.   A: When I was a young boy, my father used to take me diving with him. I’d stay on the boat and watch his bubbles come to the surface and I’d follow him. And as we got to shallower water, I still remember it very vividly, I’d start to see the rainbow colors and the riot of marine life teeming in wondrous abundance. And that magic, that wonder, has stayed with me, and I’ll never forget it. I hope we can save reefs so that my children, and my grandchildren, get to experience that same wonder that I experienced as a young boy.   A: Coral reefs provide habitat and shelter for all kinds of marine life—per square inch, they are one of the highest biodiversity habitats in the world. And they provide humanity with a lot of medicines and food for over ½ billion people around the world. In Hawai‘i, they protect our coastal areas to the tune of $836 million annually. Without coral reefs, our economy would be a lot more vulnerable. In terms of livelihoods, and fishermen feeding the families, or local businesses and tourism operations that rely on coral reef ecosystems—I’ve seen this dependency on coral reef health play out countless of times across many countries. Coral reefs keep many island economies thriving. It’s really in our best interest to keep them healthy. As the Hawaiian proverb goes,  —as the ocean thrives, so do we."

        "content": "Recently, the CORAL team gathered in the vibrant coastal paradise of Cozumel, Mexico, for an unforgettable staff summit. This event brought together staff members, board members, and key partners from around the globe to collaborate, learn, and set the course for the future of coral reef conservation. Our primary goals were to foster relationships among team members, promote cross-departmental collaboration, and provide opportunities for personal growth and skill enhancement. We dove into open-space conversations, tackled conflict resolution workshops, and enjoyed fun activities like scuba diving and snorkeling. These moments helped us bond, improve communication, and strengthen our commitment to protecting our oceans. The dive excursions were a highlight for many of us, providing a chance to see the rich coral reefs of Cozumel up close. We enjoyed several morning dives (and snorkels), including a memorable dive with our board members. These underwater adventures were nothing short of magical. We encountered a variety of marine life, from baby sharks and giant sea turtles to elegant rays and a dazzling array of colorful fish. Every dive served as a reminder of the vibrant ecosystems we are dedicated to protecting. It was particularly exciting to watch our dive masters talk through CORAL-produced dive guides, reminding visitors to adhere to sustainable diving practices. We dove in a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which added an extra layer of significance to our experience. Having a patrol boat check our passes was a highlight, as we know the importance of regulatory efforts in preserving these fragile environments. It was affirming to witness firsthand how our collaborative efforts with local authorities and partners are making a tangible difference. Diving in the MPA not only allowed us to observe the stunning biodiversity of Cozumel’s reefs but also gave us a unique perspective on the impact of our conservation efforts in the region. Being in the water together and experiencing the beauty and challenges of the reefs reinforced our dedication to our mission and the importance of our work. El momento más bonito para mi en el summit fue cuando me lancé al agua para hacer snorkel! (The most beautiful moment for me at the summit was when I jumped into the water to snorkel!) Spending time with the team and board members underwater was an incredible experience. It allowed us to see firsthand the vital importance of our work and underscored why protecting reefs is essential. My favorite moment was diving with the whole team! Key moments included spotting a seahorse, double flying gurnards, and a huge turtle! Our summit was packed with engaging workshops and activities designed to boost our personal growth and skills. One of the standout sessions was our conflict resolution workshop. Using translation software, we broke down language barriers and connected with colleagues we hadn’t previously worked with. These sessions mixed insightful talks with hands-on role-playing exercises, giving us practical tools for navigating challenges and creating a more harmonious work environment. We also participated in open-space conversations, where we could choose from various CORAL-related topics and break into small group discussions. This format allowed us to share thoughts, questions, and ideas freely, encouraging creative problem-solving and a deeper understanding of each other’s work. The best part of the week was being able to see each other and interact personally, connect as a team, and identify our strategies and ways of collaborating. I think this strengthens us as a team. I loved connecting with coworkers I don’t usually meet with, gaining a better understanding of CORAL’s reach, and making valuable connections with the Western Caribbean team. My favorite thing was getting to know more about the ‘whole person’ of many of our fabulous staff! My favorite was feeling the good vibes and team bonding…and all the smiles! Throughout the week we had the opportunity to learn about   in the Western Caribbean. Tanya and Javier, our local experts, provided an in-depth overview, shedding light on both the challenges and successes faced by the region. They discussed the current state of Cozumel’s reefs, highlighting the main stressors such as climate change, pollution, overfishing, and tourism pressure. Our ongoing efforts in the area include reef restoration, sustainable tourism, and community engagement programs. Tanya and Javier outlined our goals for FY25, emphasizing our commitment to expanding these initiatives.  Collaboration with   and the cruise industry was another key focus. By creating DMOs, we ensure tourism development aligns with sustainable practices, benefiting both the environment and the local economy. Engaging with the cruise industry allows us to advocate for responsible tourism and reduce its environmental footprint. At the end of the session, CORAL staff had the opportunity to sit down with local partners to better understand their work and explore future collaboration. These discussions provided invaluable insights and strengthened our commitment to working hand-in-hand with local communities to protect and restore coral reefs. Learning from the successes and challenges in Cozumel gives us a deeper understanding of coral reef conservation complexities and inspires us to implement similar strategies globally. My favorite part of the Summit was the opportunity to showcase the work being done here in the Western Caribbean, while connecting with the entire team as colleagues and most importantly as humans with a common goal. It was great to connect with someone who works directly with the Marine Protected Areas around Cozumel. Having an open dialogue and hearing firsthand about the challenges and benefits of this system was incredibly valuable. Spending quality time with my remote coworkers is always a treat. Being physically in the same space as these wonderful humans–who share the same level of passion and dedication to the ocean–has deepened relationships in ways we are not able to through a computer screen. The CORAL Staff Summit in Cozumel was a testament to the power of unity and shared purpose. As we return to our respective regions, we carry with us renewed energy and a deeper commitment to protecting coral reefs. Together, we are poised to make even greater strides in conservation, ensuring that these vital ecosystems continue to thrive for generations to come."

The Olowalu Reef along the west coast of Maui, also known as the “Mother Reef,” contains some of Hawai‘i’s oldest corals and acts as an important source of larvae to Maui Nui. It also provides food and shelter to many marine animals and is significant to Native Hawaiian culture and the local economy.  Currently, we risk losing Olowalu’s coral reefs due to local stressors in the area, like land-based pollution. When it rains, sediment runs off of degraded landscapes, enters the ocean, and pollutes the water. These contaminants then block sunlight, increase the risk of coral disease, and ultimately can smother coral reefs.  We need to act now if we want to save Olowalu’s reefs and contribute to the protection of Hawai‘i’s nearshore waters. And thanks to the support from Hawai‘i Community Foundation, we are one step closer. This year, we will collaborate with  Kīpuka Olowalu to increase their capacity to implement new coastal resilience strategies in the valley above Olowalu’s reefs. Additionally, we plan to increase awareness and urgency around community action and focus on systemic and structural problems that have led to poor land management. "

The focus for the year was achieving measurable outcomes to save coral reefs and to drive conservation programs and science to the next level. Here, we’ll explore some of the key highlights from the report. We worked with local communities and governments to enhance protection of marine protected areas and to promote sustainable fishing practices. Through this work we protected over 8,000 square kilometers of coral reef habitat, which is a major win for the health of these vital ecosystems. To complement this, CORAL supported 19  , giving them resources to manage and protect their coral reefs. In addition, we kept over 29 million gallons of sewage out of coastal waters. In 2022 we grew our climate adaptation partnerships and technology alongside an alliance of scientists to safeguard coral reefs so they can adapt to climate change. We collected over 2 million temperature data points in the Western Caribbean to understand how reef geomorphology links to thermal and genetic diversity.

        "content": "At just 31 years old, Trudy Hilton, a local from the island of Roatan, Honduras is determined to make a lasting impact in her community. She recently became Roatan’s new vice mayor and is focusing on improving the long-term sustainability of the island and its natural environments.  We’re proud to call Hilton a local partner, having previously collaborated with her on initiatives to improve ocean conditions in Roatan. Like CORAL, Hilton understands the value of coral reefs and is dedicated to preserving the many benefits these ecosystems bring to her community. Success didn’t come easily to Hilton. Having grown up in a family affected by generational poverty, she faced many day-to-day challenges and setbacks. But she was able to beat the odds and graduate high school—a major accomplishment in her family—and later went on to study political science at an American college. She has since worked at an HIV/AIDS clinic and in community development, among other projects.  Thanks to her neighbor, a founder of the  , she was inspired to give back to her community from a young age. “I think people see the love I have for my people and for this island,” says Hilton, “That is what opened the door for me to be considered for the position of vice mayor.”   Now in office, Hilton is working to put rules and regulations in place that will protect the island’s coral reefs. “I spent almost every day of my childhood in the water,” says Hilton. “So am I connected [to the ocean]? Absolutely.” According to Hilton, coral reefs are important to her and to the island because of the protection they provide from tropical storms and the value they add to the local tourism industry.  For the last couple of years, Hilton has worked with CORAL, along with other local partners, to improve water and sanitation on Roatan. Wastewater pollution creates challenging conditions for coral reefs and makes it harder for them to adapt to our planet’s changing climate, along with many negative impacts on human health.  Leaders at CORAL, such as our Mesoamerican Regional Program Director Tanya Amaya and Conservation Program Director Jenny Myton, have educated Hilton on wastewater pollution and how it impacts coral reefs. Together, they are now working to implement solutions to this problem.  During her time in office, Hilton says,“We are going to give huge priority to water and sanitation, and black waters, because they are damaging our reefs and affecting our health and the environment.”     While wastewater pollution is a major problem throughout the island, Hilton wants to focus on solving the problem in Coxen Hole.  In Coxen Hole, CORAL has been working with local residents to operationalize a wastewater treatment plant. The goal is to replicate the  , in which we significantly decreased coral disease and bacterial levels in nearshore waters.  “I believe if we can get Coxen Hole in order, then we can do it in any other community,” says Hilton. According to Hilton, a large population, various types of homes, and more traditional ways of thinking, all make Coxen Hole one of most challenging neighborhoods in which to tackle wastewater pollution.  But Hilton is ready to put in the work. She plans to educate and work hand-in-hand with different members of the community, in order to prioritize sanitation initiatives and the positive outcomes clean water will have on local residents and the island’s coral reefs.  We look forward to continuing this important partnership with Hilton and other key players in Roatan, in order to keep coral reef ecosystems healthy and thriving in the Mesoamerican reef region. "

        "content": "Looking at Earth from space, our planet’s rivers and streams resemble a vast network of veins, pulsing with life and water. These natural waterways, part of intricate systems called watersheds, weave through landscapes, connecting us in unseen ways to the ocean’s vast expanse.  Whether it’s a closed watershed draining into a secluded lake or open lagoons merging with the ocean,  Imagine the Earth’s surface veined with a network of rivers and streams, much like the circulatory system in our bodies. These watersheds are nature’s way of collecting and delivering rainwater and snowmelt to the ocean.  .  Watersheds are the Earth’s lifelines, ensuring that water, essential for all forms of life, circulates through ecosystems, towns, cities, and eventually, the sea. Take the Amazon Basin, our planet’s largest watershed, which discharges an average of 209,000 cubic meters of water per second into the Atlantic Ocean. Or the Mississippi River Basin, which gathers water from 31 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, illustrating how watersheds can shape the geography, climate, and economy of extensive regions.  These massive water systems play a crucial role in our world, influencing weather patterns, supporting biodiversity, and providing water resources for billions of people. So why does this matter to coral reefs? Well, as pristine as some of these waterways may appear, the harsh truth is they’re often carriers of pollutants from our cities, farms, and factories. Everything from plastic bottles to agricultural runoff finds its way into these waters, embarking on a destructive journey to the ocean.  The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling vortex of marine debris double the size of Texas, is a stark illustration of how our consumption and waste management practices on land can lead to environmental catastrophes in the ocean.  break down into microplastics, are ingested by marine life, enter into the food chain, and cause untold harm to ocean ecosystems.  leads to deadly algal blooms, creating vast dead zones where life, including coral reefs, cannot thrive. These examples underscore the interconnectedness of our actions and the health of marine environments.  This “water footprint” encompasses not only the direct use of water in our homes but also the indirect use embedded in the lifecycle of goods and services we consume. For instance, the agricultural runoff from producing the food on our plates can lead to nutrient pollution in nearby rivers, which eventually flows into the ocean, causing harmful algal blooms and dead zones.   By becoming mindful of our water footprint and making eco-friendly choices, we can help ensure cleaner rivers and healthier oceans.  Simple yet effective steps like opting for minimal packaging, supporting sustainable agriculture and choosing more plant-based options, reducing water-intensive goods, and cutting down on plastic use can make a big difference. Additionally, choosing organic lawn care to minimize harmful runoff and getting involved in local clean-up efforts are practical ways to keep pollution out of our waterways.  By advocating for policies and initiatives that focus on water quality and pollution reduction, we collectively contribute to a more sustainable and thriving environment. In the heart of Maui Nui, which includes the Hawaiian islands of Maui, Molokai, and Lanai, CORAL is actively working to combat the issue of watershed pollution affecting our oceans.   By adopting a “ridge to reef” approach, we aim to restore the natural function of an ahupua‘a (watershed) to filter stormwater and absorb nutrients, sediments, and other chemicals, showcasing our commitment to protecting these vital connections. By understanding the intricate connections between our local waterways and the ocean, we can begin to appreciate the profound impact our everyday actions have on the world’s oceans.  . Let’s commit to protecting these vital lifelines, ensuring a healthier planet for future generations. Together, we can safeguard the health of our blue planet, proving that even the smallest actions can lead to meaningful environmental change. The journey from land to sea is far more interconnected than we might realize. Our local waterways, from the smallest streams to the mightiest rivers, serve as vital conduits linking our actions on land to the health and vitality of coral reefs and marine ecosystems. As we navigate through Earth Month and beyond, let’s embrace our shared responsibility to protect these precious lifelines. By understanding and appreciating the profound impact of our everyday choices, we can work together to ensure a healthier planet for generations to come. Together, let’s safeguard the health of our blue planet and continue to make a positive difference, one drop at a time."

        "content": "Why don’t we focus on coral restoration? It’s a question we, at CORAL, have been asked time and time again.  We address overfishing, minimize water pollution, support local communities, and lead cutting-edge research on coral adaptation to climate change…but we don’t generally work on coral restoration projects. Our decision comes down to the fact that coral restoration alone is unlikely to save reefs from our planet’s warming temperatures if we don’t reduce local stressors. According to a   published in   and co-authored by CORAL scientists, popular coral restoration techniques would be unlikely to protect coral reefs from climate change. The research used innovative models to explore the response of coral reefs to restoration projects that propagate corals and outplant them into the wild. Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of outplanting corals that have been genetically adapted to warmer temperatures, sometimes called ‘super corals,’ to reefs experiencing climate change as a way to build resilience to warming. The models found that neither approach was successful at preventing a decline in coral coverage in the next several hundred years due to climate change, and that selectively breeding corals to be more heat tolerant will only lead to benefits if conducted at a very large scale over the course of centuries. Even then, the benefits won’t be realized for 200 years. In the models, restoring areas with corals that haven’t been selected to be more heat tolerant was ineffective at helping corals survive climate change except at the largest supplementation levels explored. Though coral restoration can have some benefits, like educating communities about reef ecosystems or replenishing an area that has been hit by a storm or suffered direct physical damage, more scientists are speaking up about the limitations of conservation approaches that focus solely on restoration.  “Our previous research shows that corals have the best chance of adapting to the effects of climate change, like warming ocean temperatures, if there is high genetic diversity and if habitat is protected from other local stressors.” says Dr. Lisa McManus, the study’s co-author and a CORAL partner. “Repopulating a coral reef with corals that have similar genetic makeups could reduce an area’s natural genetic diversity, and therefore make it harder for all corals to adapt to climate change.”  Restoration alone is unlikely to save coral reefs from warming waters—and moreover, the techniques are expensive and would need to be performed at an unrealistically large scale in order to be effective. Additionally, coral restoration projects can only be successful if local threats to reefs are managed effectively: otherwise, you’re utilizing resources to outplant corals into an area where they will soon be threatened by poor water quality or overfishing.  By doing that, we can create the conditions that corals need to be able to adapt to climate change on their own, so long as emissions are also reduced. That’s why we invest in projects that will keep coral reefs healthy and protect a wide-range of diverse coral reef networks.   For example, in Hawai’i and  in the Western Caribbean region, we  , protect marine habitats, invest in wastewater treatment infrastructure, mobilize communities to save their coral reefs—and more. And on a global scale, we advance innovative technologies, like the  , to help stakeholders better understand how to factor natural evolutionary processes into their conservation efforts.  By reducing major threats, like overfishing and water pollution, we are keeping coral reefs healthy at the local level. We are also advocating for climate action and building worldwide partnerships and spreading awareness of how to create the necessary conditions for corals to adapt to climate change. We know we have a long road ahead. But by focusing on the most effective conservation strategies, we have a fighting chance to save coral reefs—some of the ocean’s most valuable marine ecosystems. "

        "content": "As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, the health of our oceans remains a critical concern. Oceans cover more than 70% of our planet’s surface and are integral to life on Earth. However, the future of these vast, life-sustaining waters are increasingly threatened.  Here’s why clean water is vital for the future of our oceans. Clean water is the cornerstone of healthy marine ecosystems.  From the tiniest plankton to the largest whales, these ecosystems rely on the purity of water to sustain life.  Coral reefs are incredibly sensitive to changes in water quality. Polluted water can lead to disease, coral bleaching, and death, impacting not only the corals but also the myriad of species that depend on them for shelter and food. Did you know? Approximately   rely on seafood as a primary source of protein.   Toxins such as mercury and microplastics accumulate in marine life and can pose significant health risks to humans who consume contaminated seafood. Moreover, many coastal communities depend on clean oceans for their livelihoods. Fishing, tourism, and recreation industries all require healthy marine environments. The degradation of water quality can lead to economic losses and affect the well-being of these communities. Oceans play a pivotal role in regulating the Earth’s climate.  However, polluted and degraded oceans lose their capacity to perform these essential functions. Pollution can also exacerbate ocean acidification, a process where increased CO2 levels lower the pH of seawater. This has severe consequences for marine life, particularly for organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as mollusks and corals. Maintaining clean water in our oceans is essential to support their role in climate regulation and to protect marine biodiversity. Clean water is crucial for the conservation of marine biodiversity.  Polluted oceans can lead to dead zones—areas with such low oxygen levels that marine life cannot survive. These zones are often caused by nutrient pollution from agricultural runoff, which leads to algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water.  Biodiverse ecosystems are better able to withstand and recover from environmental stressors, making the health of our oceans a matter of global environmental stability. Protecting the future of our oceans requires concerted efforts at multiple levels.  Limiting the use of single-use plastics, properly disposing of waste, and reducing chemical runoff from agriculture and industry are critical steps.  Promoting   and aquaculture practices helps ensure that marine populations remain healthy and that ecosystems are not overexploited.  Addressing climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions will help mitigate the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.  Establishing  , implementing wastewater treatment plants, and supporting conservation initiatives can safeguard critical habitats and species.  Increasing awareness about the importance of clean oceans and encouraging responsible behavior among individuals and communities is essential. It’s crystal clear…clean water is vital for the health and sustainability of our oceans and our planet. It supports marine life, human health, and economic stability, and plays a key role in regulating the Earth’s climate. Protecting our oceans from pollution and degradation is a shared responsibility that requires urgent and sustained action. The future of our planet depends on it."

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Can you imagine being constantly forced to drink, swim, and bathe in dirty, polluted water? It’s a harsh reality for many humans, yet ironically, our actions subject coral reefs to the same grim conditions. Water quality threats are a major culprit in coral decline. Among the various contaminants, untreated wastewater or sewage emerges as a leading contributor, causing devastating effects on coral health. And well, let’s face it, that’s…crap.  But before we break down the major water quality issues affecting coral reefs today, let’s touch on why this is important. Coral reefs are indispensable ecosystems, punching well above their size. Occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor, they support an astonishing 25% of all marine species. Their economic value is staggering, generating billions annually through tourism, fisheries, and safeguarding coastal areas.  Beyond their economic impact, reefs are vital in global climate regulation, contributing significantly to carbon and nitrogen cycles. Despite their critical role, coral reefs face an expanding number of threats, jeopardizing their survival. Let’s talk about untreated (or poorly treated) wastewater, or as we like to call it, straight-up sewage. Our team has categorized this as one of the biggest threats to reefs around the world.  The issue comes from both cities and rural areas where the sewage systems are, let’s say, less than ideal. When this untreated sewage flows into coastal waters, it brings along a cocktail of nasty stuff like high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients are a buffet for algae, which grows out of control and smothers coral reefs, blocking sunlight and sucking up oxygen.  On top of that, sewage is a breeding ground for bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that can make corals sick. And let’s not forget the household and industrial chemicals mixed in, which are toxic and mess with coral reproduction and growth. In short, untreated sewage is bad news for our reefs. Agricultural activities are another big culprit in water pollution. Think about it – all those pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used on farms don’t just stay put. They run off into rivers and eventually end up in the ocean.  When these chemicals hit the water, they promote harmful algal blooms (HABs), which produce toxins detrimental to coral health. These substances also cause sedimentation, making the water cloudy and blocking sunlight from reaching the corals. And without sunlight, corals can’t photosynthesize and thrive. Industries along coastlines often dump pollutants straight into the ocean. We’re talking about heavy metals, oil, and other harmful chemicals.  Really? Yes, really. These pollutants can have catastrophic effects on coral reefs. They build up in the tissues of marine organisms, causing long-term health issues. Plus, they mess with the reproductive systems of corals, making it harder for them to bounce back from other stresses. Plastic pollution is a catastrophic, growing problem for our oceans, and coral reefs are especially vulnerable. Plastic debris can physically damage coral structures, breaking branches and harming their growth. Even worse, plastic can act as a vehicle for pathogens, introducing diseases and causing widespread coral decline.   have found that coral reefs with plastic debris were 20 times more likely to be diseased than those without. Humans produce about 300 million tons of plastic  , and an estimated 8 million tons of it end up in the oceans. If we don’t tackle this issue, our reefs will continue to decline. Construction activities, deforestation, and coastal development significantly increase sedimentation rates in coastal waters. This excess sediment clouds the water, preventing essential sunlight from reaching coral reefs, which is critical for their photosynthesis and survival.  Additionally, sediment often carries harmful pollutants such as heavy metals and pesticides, further compromising water quality. As sediment accumulates, it can bury corals, suffocating them and impeding their ability to regenerate. Climate change, though not a water quality issue itself, intensifies numerous challenges for coral reefs. Increasing sea temperatures trigger coral bleaching events, where corals expel their vital algae partners, leading to widespread mortality if prolonged.  Moreover, ocean acidification from rising CO2 levels weakens coral skeletons, making them vulnerable to additional stressors. These compounding effects underscore the urgent need for global action to mitigate climate change and protect coral reef ecosystems. Untreated wastewater is the primary culprit, introducing harmful nutrients, pathogens, and chemicals into the ocean.  Tackling untreated wastewater is critical for the longevity of coral reefs. Improving infrastructure by investing in proper sewage treatment facilities can significantly reduce the amount of untreated wastewater entering marine environments and allow coral reefs to recover and thrive. Enforcing stricter regulations on wastewater discharges can minimize pollution, educating communities about the impacts of untreated wastewater on coral reefs can foster better waste management practices, and implementing green infrastructure, such as constructed wetlands, can naturally treat sewage before it reaches the ocean. Coral reefs are in big trouble if we don’t take action now.  Addressing this challenge requires concerted efforts from governments, industries, and communities. By doing this critical work, we can preserve these lifegiving ecosystems for future generations. For more insights on marine conservation and the latest updates on coral reef health, stay tuned. Protecting our oceans is not just an environmental necessity but a legacy we owe to the planet."

To save coral reefs, we must address two major threats: poor water quality from land-based pollution and unsustainable fishing practices. By tackling these issues and implementing climate-smart planning, we can help coral reefs adapt to climate change. Our research shows that this is not only possible but that solutions are available right now. The future of coral reefs is promising. By now you may have seen our BBC mini-documentary featuring a community working alongside CORAL to secure a vibrant future for their reef. This collaboration ensures the reef can continue to sustain the livelihoods that depend on it, showcasing a model for successful conservation efforts. In the Honduran community of West End, we successfully implemented a community-supported wastewater treatment plant, connecting 36 restaurants, 333 homes, and 63 businesses, including 11 dive shops. It may not be the most glamorous work, but it has the biggest impact on these delicate ecosystems! The West End project alone is keeping 30 million gallons of raw sewage annually off what was once a dying reef and a beach unsafe for families to swim. Now, we are focusing on a wastewater project in Coxen Hole. Our goal beyond this is to replicate our successes in three more communities.   to our Clean Water for Reefs Campaign will help tackle wastewater issues in priority coral reef areas with significant tourism impacts, including Cozumel, Mexico; Coxen Hole, Roatan; and Caye Caulker, Belize. These locations have what we call “enabling conditions”, the conditions that set us up for success:  to our Clean Water for Reefs campaign will connect another 800 homes to the wastewater system, resulting in 49 MILLION gallons of sewage being properly treated before entering the ocean.

Thanks to our Global Conservation Science team, we have given everyone the opportunity to participate in the recovery of coral reefs during bleaching events. As climate change warms our oceans, we know corals can adapt, but only if we let them. Our team in the Western Caribbean was busy in 2023! We all know access to clean water is essential for life, and coral reefs are no different. Securing clean water for reefs is a foundational effort here at CORAL, and our team created the Marine Water Quality Protocol for the Mesoamerican Reef System.  In addition to clean water, coral reefs thrive from their symbiotic relationships with the creatures around them. In the spirit of sustainable fishing practices, our team has also worked diligently on preserving lobsters and conchs, of which both are equally ecologically important for coral reef ecosystems. In 2023 we officially kicked off our partnership with Ka Honua Momona (KHM) in Molokai. KHM staff have lineal ties to this beautiful place and have kuleana (responsibility) in caring for Alii and Kalokoeli fishponds, which are community treasures and sources of education, food, cultural renewal, and connection. As a result of this project’s efforts to improve habitat for fish and wildlife, we anticipate a simultaneous enhancement of community resilience. Unfortunately, coral reefs are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms. This has led to a decline in the health and resilience of many coral reefs, which in turn has negatively impacted the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them for food, income, and cultural identity. To address these challenges, a team of researchers from University of Leeds (UK), Coral Reef Alliance (USA), Rare (Philippines & Indonesia), Pattimura University (Indonesia), and many other partners are launching a project in the Philippines and Indonesia.

We all know the oceans are facing some tough times, but there’s plenty of room for optimism.   It’s about being mindful and making choices that matter. In this article, we’re going to break down some straightforward and effective ways to help our oceans thrive in 2024. So, let’s get into it and see how we can all contribute to a healthier, happier ocean. Plastic pollution is a major issue for our oceans, but tackling it is easier than you might think. This year, let’s challenge ourselves to cut back on single-use plastics. Think reusable water bottles, cloth bags for shopping, and paper/metal straws.  These small switches in our daily routine can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste we contribute to the ocean. It’s all about making conscious choices that have a positive impact on our marine environment: The increase in carbon dioxide levels is not just a global warming issue; it’s also making our oceans more acidic, affecting coral reefs worldwide. You can help by adopting eco-friendly transportation methods, like cycling or public transit, and being more energy-efficient at home.

        "content": "In the wake of the devastating wildfires that swept through Maui, the Coral Reef Alliance felt a deep sense of urgency to act. The wildfires in Lahaina, a place many call home, not only ravaged the landscape but also struck at the heart of our ‘ohana—our family, friends, supporters, and the vibrant ecosystems we are committed to protecting. This tragedy served as a stark wake-up call, underscoring the critical nature of our mission to safeguard our oceans and the communities that rely on them. In response, we launched the  , an emergency fund reserved specifically for climate change-related disasters, including coastal flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and mass bleaching events. This initiative wasn’t merely a reaction to a crisis; it emerged from the necessity to bolster the resilience and health of our coastal ecosystems and communities, ensuring their sustainability for generations to come. “The people are most important right now to everyone,”   Heather Starck, Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, in the early days following the disaster. “We have staff, family, friends, and colleagues facing unimaginable loss. Our focus is on supporting them as we all work towards recovery.” This sentiment has continuously fueled our commitment to Maui’s recovery and resilience. The wildfires that swept through Lahaina have underscored the vulnerability of our communities and the ecosystems that sustain them.   The aftermath of the fires saw three such organizations facing unprecedented challenges, with losses that threatened to halt their crucial work. Through the Community Resilience Fund, we’ve been able to offer unrestricted support to: By extending a helping hand to these organizations, we not only aid in their immediate recovery but also reinforce the foundation of our collective mission. Each of these groups embodies the essence of resilience and dedication to the environment and community of West Maui. Their work is integral to the health of both land and sea, which in turn benefits the coral reef ecosystems we are working to protect. As for the reefs, the true extent of the wildfires’ impact remains uncertain. “We do not know the state of the reefs yet, but we’re working with our partners to find out,” says Makayla Rickard, Maui Nui Program Manager. The fires have likely left behind toxic chemicals that could be flushed into the ocean, posing significant risks to the reefs, especially those near Lahaina, like the ancient Olowalu Reef. The main threats to these vital ecosystems are runoff and debris, which could bury the reefs, blocking sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. There’s also the risk of algae blooms, fueled by fertilizers or sewage in the runoff, which can smother corals. “In the wake of the recent wildfires, the health of our coral reefs and the quality of the surrounding waters remain top priorities for us. Our partners are currently conducting thorough studies to assess the impact. We stand ready to respond and take action based on their findings.” The road to recovery is long, and the community and natural resources are still suffering greatly.  . As we await more data on the reefs’ condition, our focus remains on aiding the community’s recovery and preparing for the challenges ahead. The Community Resilience Fund is one way we’re contributing to these efforts, and we  .  Your support enables us to extend our reach and impact, ready to respond when our communities and coral reefs need us most. Together, we can safeguard the beauty and diversity of our oceans for generations to come, honoring the legacy of our Maui ‘ohana and the vibrant ecosystems we are committed to protecting."

        "content": "Hang tight, because we’re about to clear up one of the ocean’s biggest misconceptions.  Have you ever looked at a coral reef and thought, “Wow, what a beautiful plant… or is it a rock?” You’re not alone in the confusion. But here’s the scoop: corals are actually animals, and they’re as lively and complex as the ocean itself. We’re diving into the world of corals to debunk some common misconceptions and reveal the truth about these vibrant underwater communities. The appearance of corals can lead to two common misconceptions – that they’re either plants or just inanimate rocks. Let’s explore why neither is true by taking a closer look at both soft and hard corals. Soft corals, including sea fans, sea pens, and blue corals, belong to the Octocorallia group and challenge the plant misconception with their graceful, swaying movements. Unlike plants,   don’t photosynthesize but have a symbiotic relationship with algae that do. Supported by spiny structures called sclerites rather than a hard skeleton, soft corals exhibit the flexibility and dynamism characteristic of animal life, contributing significantly to the reef’s ecosystem by offering shelter and a vibrant backdrop for marine life. Hard corals, or stony corals, form the rigid, complex structures often mistaken for rocks. These corals are colonies of tiny polyps that secrete calcium carbonate, forming a hard skeleton that is the foundation of coral reef ecosystems.   ability to build and shape the underwater landscape showcases their role as living, dynamic animals. They capture food, engage in symbiotic relationships, and respond to environmental changes, far from the static existence of a rock. A common myth is that corals grow in the same manner as plants. While corals do grow and spread over time, their method of growth is distinctly animal.   by cloning themselves, a process where a single polyp divides into two or more new polyps, expanding the colony. This asexual reproduction, known as budding, is a trait shared with other animals, not plants. Moreover, corals can also  , releasing eggs and sperm into the water to create new coral larvae. This dual strategy for growth and reproduction underscores their animal nature, differing significantly from plant growth and reproduction mechanisms. The presence of zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae living within most corals, leads to the misconception that corals themselves perform photosynthesis. While these algae do photosynthesize within the coral’s tissues, providing essential nutrients, the coral itself is not capable of photosynthesis. This relationship is a form of mutualism where both the coral (animal) and the algae (plant) benefit, further emphasizing the coral’s role as an animal that depends on its relationship with plant-like organisms for survival, rather than being a plant itself. Another myth is that, unlike animals, corals do not respond to their environment. In reality, corals have a sophisticated relationship with their surroundings. They can sense changes in light, temperature, and water chemistry, adjusting their behavior accordingly. For example, corals can expel their symbiotic algae when water temperatures become too high, a stress response known as  . While this is a defensive mechanism, it highlights corals’ sensitivity and responsiveness to environmental changes, traits characteristic of animals. These vibrant ecosystems, crafted by small yet resilient animals, highlight the ocean’s incredible resilience and diversity. Recognizing corals as living entities prompts us to reevaluate our relationship with the marine environment. This understanding serves as a call to action, urging us to adopt more responsible behaviors and make choices that support the health of our oceans. By acknowledging our role in this ecosystem, we’re invited to contribute positively to the preservation of coral reefs and the rich biodiversity they sustain."

        "content": "Let’s explore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), the safe places of our ocean’s biodiversity. In the world of conservation, MPAs are a key strategy for safeguarding the most lively and endangered parts of our oceans. These are special areas–managed by a variety of stakeholders, including governments, local communities, and organizations like ours–that vary from places with strict regulations around sustainability to spots where human access is completely restricted. These areas are crucial for protecting marine life and their homes, while also allowing for responsible human interaction with these vital ecosystems. , shielding them from threats like overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. By offering safe breeding grounds, MPAs do more than just conserve biodiversity; they also help replenish fish stocks, supporting both the natural environment and the economies of coastal communities. This dual benefit is a testament to the essential role MPAs play in maintaining ocean health. Moreover,  , offering insights into marine ecology and helping to refine conservation efforts to bolster the resilience of marine ecosystems around the globe. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) play a pivotal role in the health and sustainability of our oceans. Among the diverse types of MPAs,  . In these areas, all forms of extractive activities, including fishing, drilling, and mining, are prohibited. This absolute protection is designed to allow marine ecosystems to recover and flourish, undisturbed by human interference, making them vital sanctuaries for endangered species and biodiversity hotspots. On the other hand,  . These areas are designed to harmonize environmental protection with human needs, allowing for sustainable fishing, responsible tourism, and even some level of resource extraction. The goal is to ensure these activities do not compromise the ecological integrity of the marine environment. By implementing a carefully managed plan, multiple-use MPAs can support local economies, providing livelihoods for communities while still prioritizing the conservation of marine life and habitats. Dr. Helen Fox, our Conservation Science Director, has helped shed new light on how effective these MPAs can be. She has   showing that  . Even in places where human activity is high, multiple-use MPAs can work just as well as no-take zones in helping marine life flourish and supporting the people who live nearby. This finding is crucial because it shows we need all types of MPAs to keep our oceans healthy and resilient. Thanks to Dr. Fox’s insights, we’re learning that the right balance of protection and sustainable use in MPAs can make a big difference for both our marine environments and local communities. It’s about finding ways to protect our oceans while also considering the needs of those who depend on them. The success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is deeply intertwined with the active participation of local communities. By marrying traditional knowledge with the latest in conservation science, MPAs foster a profound sense of responsibility and care among those who live by the sea.  From the vibrant ecosystems of the Galápagos Marine Reserve to the historical sites within the USS Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, MPAs protect a wide range of unique habitats and species. Despite covering just a fraction of the ocean’s vast expanse, these areas are critical to global marine conservation efforts, contributing significantly to the overall health of our oceans. In Honduras, for example, we’ve seen remarkable progress with over   now under effective management and protection, partly thanks to the introduction of locally supported patrolling programs. This effort has been vital in protecting these areas from illegal activities and ensuring a thriving habitat for marine life. Our journey in marine conservation is evolving, with a keen focus on practical steps to protect our oceans. A prime example of this is our initiative to establish a new ‘no-take zone’ in Roatan, Honduras. This area, stretching from Sandy Bay to West Bay, is a critical reef ecosystem, highlighted by the discovery of vital fish spawning sites. To make this vision a reality, we’re teaming up with local communities, dive shops, and government bodies. Our approach is all about working together—educating, planning, and enforcing conservation strategies that everyone can stand behind. Together, we create a united front against overfishing and poaching, ensuring our marine life thrives. This effort in Roatan is just the beginning. We believe in the power of community-driven conservation to spark widespread change, safeguarding our oceans for the future. Join us as we continue to protect these vital ecosystems, one step at a time."

The new legislation officially bans the commercial fishing of sharks in all 1,990,530 square kilometers of the nation’s waters, an area equivalent to the size of Mexico. The Marshall Islands joins Palau, Honduras, Tokelau, the Maldives, and the Bahamas in prohibiting the commercial fishing of sharks in their nation’s waters. “We salute the Republic of the Marshall Islands for recognizing the importance of healthy shark populations to our oceans,” said Matt Rand, director of global shark conservation for the Pew Environment Group, the organization which is spearheading efforts to establish shark sanctuaries where targeted fishing for the species is prohibited. “The momentum for protecting these animals continues to spread across the globe, creating greater areas where they can thrive without the threats of commercial fishing.” The news of the Marshall Islands comes as Fiji’s government considers revisions to its own fisheries laws that would ban commercial shark fishing and the trade of shark fins and other products derived from sharks captured in national waters. \nThe Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), in partnership with the Pew Environment Group and the Fijian Ministry of Fisheries, is championing this new legislation. Through a targeted campaign determined to raise local support for a designated shark sanctuary, the team is educating communities in Fiji about the importance of sharks to both their history and their economy. “Fiji is home to a high diversity of sharks and many of these species are threatened with extinction globally,” said Manoa Rasigatale, a member of CORAL’s Fiji shark sanctuary campaign team. “It is time for the Fijian people to proudly stand alongside our brothers in the Central Pacific to ensure long-lasting protection for sharks.” The Fijian government is expected to issue an official decree before the year’s end.

        "content": "October 20, 2011 Suva, Fiji (Oct. 20, 2011)-Fiji’s reputation as a leader in marine conservation may be enhanced if a proposal made by the Ministry of Primary Industries’ Department of Fisheries and Forests advances next month. The agency is considering measures that would ban the commercial fishing and trade of sharks and their parts, including fins. The proposal is being drafted, and if it advances in the Cabinet, new legislation could be in place before year’s end. The government has the support of traditional leaders, as well as the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and the Pew Environment Group, nonprofit organizations that this week will launch a campaign to raise community awareness about the importance of sharks in Fiji. “A national shark sanctuary in Fiji would be a huge victory for these animals,” said Matt Rand, director of global shark conservation for the Pew Environment Group. “This action would close down a major hub in the Pacific for the trafficking of fins and highlight Fiji as home to the world’s second-largest shark sanctuary.” The proposed Fiji National Shark Sanctuary, encompassing the country’s 1.3-million-square-kilometer Exclusive Economic Zone, would be the first of its kind in Melanesia. It is modeled after similar conservation measures in the Marshall Islands, Palau, the Maldives, Honduras, the Bahamas, and Tokelau. According to Fisheries Department annual reports, the country’s exports in 2003 were 180 metric tons of shark products. Most of Fiji’s shark fins are exported. “We don’t eat shark,” said Ratu Lalabalavu, who has expressed support for a national shark sanctuary in his capacity as the traditional leader of the Tovata Confederacy. “We feel that we are doing justice to something that is very much part of our life and our history in protecting sharks.” The heads of the Burebasaga Confederacy and Kubuna Confederacy also support the designation of Fijian waters for shark conservation. “The Fijian people have a long history of supporting locally-managed marine areas,” said Rick MacPherson, conservation programs director at CORAL. “This strong cultural connection to the reefs makes our job easier as we work alongside the Fijian community to develop an effective sanctuary for sharks that benefits both the marine ecosystem and the people who rely on it. This shark movement is an excellent opportunity for us to use our resources to unite a nation to protect marine ecosystems.” Sharks are significant to the health of coral reefs. “A reef without sharks is a sick reef,” said Demian Chapman, PhD, a shark scientist at Stony Brook University in New York, who in March provided an assessment of the shark fin trade for fisheries officials in Fiji’s capital, Suva. As top ocean predators, sharks regulate the populations of prey species and potentially the overall health of the ocean, according to Chapman. Falling populations of these animals might even lead to general coral reef decline. “There is a clear empirical association between thriving shark populations and healthy coral reef ecosystems,” he said. Chapman found that the shark fin trade in Suva includes the sale of thousands of fins from sharks that are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, such as scalloped hammerhead (Endangered) and silky, blacktip reef, and bull sharks (all Near Threatened). His assessment also found trade in fins from shark species that live and breed on the reef, and are important for ecotourism. Earlier this year, the Australian Institute for Marine Studies found that reef sharks in Palau contribute nearly US$18 million annually to the national economy through diving and associated tourism activities. A similar analysis in French Polynesia found that an individual lemon shark has a lifetime value of more than US$300,000, a significantly higher figure than if it had been caught for its fins. “A living shark is worth far more than a dead shark,” said Rand. The launch event Monday, Oct. 24, at Suva’s Village 6 theater, includes the screening of a 30-minute documentary called “Shark Hope,” which is about the plight of Fiji’s sharks and efforts to protect them. It chronicles the importance of these animals to Fiji’s culture through myths and stories, as well as the critical role they play in maintaining a healthy marine environment. The film features Ratu Lalabalavu, whose traditional title is Gone Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau, and Ratu Manoa Rasagitale, who is a Fijian cultural icon, former senator, and reality television personality. # # # The Pew Environment Group is the conservation arm of The Pew \nCharitable Trusts, a nongovernmental organization that works globally to \nestablish pragmatic, science-based policies that protect our \noceans, preserve our wildlands, and promote clean energy.

        "content": "November 25, 2011  – The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) is pleased to welcome Thomas Meller, an expert in environmental tourism operations, sustainable hotel management, and conservation planning, as its newly appointed director general. Established in 2006, MARTI is a joint initiative of the Coral Reef Alliance, Amigos de Sian Ka’an, the Riviera Maya Hotel Association, the Rainforest Alliance, Grupo Intersectorial, and Sustainable Travel International. MARTI works with private, public, and civil groups-throughout the Mexican Caribbean-to implement effective environmental best practices that reduce negative tourism impacts on the marine environment. In his new leadership role, Thomas is tasked with creating new opportunities to deepen the organization’s engagement with marine recreation providers, cruise ships, hotels, and hotel developers throughout the region. “In five years, MARTI has become the most important sustainable tourism initiative in the Mesoamerican Reef region,” said Thomas Meller. “I am thrilled to serve as MARTI’s first director general. I look forward to integrating the individual strengths and expertise of our six partners to build an even stronger initiative that will achieve our vision-transforming tourism into a force for biodiversity conservation and sustainable community development.” Thomas brings to this new role over eighteen years of experience managing and implementing environmental projects. While working with the United Nations Development Programme in Jamaica, he managed the UN’s extensive environmental project portfolio, including the 2.3 million USD Typhoid Control and Prevention Program, which among other things improved wastewater treatment infrastructure in the Savanna la Mar area. After completing his postgraduate studies in environmental management at the University of Applied Economics in Berlin, he returned to Jamaica to put his skills to use improving environmental practices within the island’s expanding hotel industry. In 2000, he relocated to the Mexican Caribbean where he provided environmental hotel management consulting services as part of USAID’s Quintana Roo sustainable tourism project. During this time, he helped the first hotel in Mexico to achieve Green Globe certification, which at the time was considered the travel industry’s prime international standard for sustainability. Over the past five years, Thomas has served as MARTI’s director of hotel development and operations within Amigos de Sian Ka’an, a Cancun-based nonprofit working for the conservation of the Mexican Caribbean’s ecosystems. During this time, Thomas developed MARTI’s environmental best practices guidelines and concluded his assignment with the publication of the initiative’s Sustainable Planning, Design, and Construction Guide for the Mexican Caribbean. “Thomas holds an impressive depth of organizational knowledge and qualifications that make him the ideal candidate for this position,” said Rick MacPherson, Conservation Programs Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, a founding partner of MARTI. “Thomas co-developed many of the tools we use in the field today to advance the initiative and has been instrumental in brokering key relationships within the tourism industry. He has his finger on the pulse of the Mesoamerican landscape and is well-positioned to take this group to the next level.” ### \nThe Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) is a joint initiative working to ensure that the breath-taking natural resources that draw millions of tourists to the Mesoamerican Reef region each year are maintained and enhanced for the benefit of current and future generations.

        "content": "November 13, 2012 A recent discovery reveals coral cover reminiscent of 30 years ago Honduras Reefs—A unique dive site, previously unknown to the scientific community, has been discovered by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), The Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI), and their local partners near the coastal town of Tela, Honduras. The reef is so exceptional that the local municipal government recently declared it a marine protected area, and CORAL is now launching an effort with local officials, conservation groups, and business owners to ensure its future protection. Divers who have the opportunity to visit this area will get an extraordinary glimpse of what a Caribbean reef looked like nearly thirty years ago. The healthy reef includes an area known as Capiro Banks, which boasts an astounding 69 percent live coral cover. With the average coral cover in the Caribbean today at less than 20 percent, the reef is a rare find. Furthermore, the reef boasts an unusually high concentration of Diadema sea urchins—important reef grazers whose populations plummeted in the 1980s. And just northwest of Capiro Banks, adjacent to a terrestrial park, the team recorded more than 800 critically endangered elkhorn corals. This important reef-building coral provides valuable habitat for marine life. “These reefs along the Caribbean mainland of Honduras are quite remarkable,” noted Jason Vasques, Assistant Director of Conservation Programs at CORAL. “The discovery of Capiro Banks is surprising because here is a remarkable reef that has no business being where it is. Despite increasing pressure from nearby nutrient-rich and sediment laden rivers and watersheds, this coral oasis appears to be thriving. While many elkhorn coral populations have collapsed throughout the Caribbean due to disease outbreaks, bleaching, and numerous other localized impacts, this particular reef is defying the odds. It may also be a critical source of coral spawn that could potentially allow this endangered species to repopulate the region.” The declaration of the marine protected area near Tela was based in part on reef monitoring data collected by CORAL and HRI as part of the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) program. After the team presented its findings to the Honduras Vice-Minister of Tourism Synthia Bennett Soleman and David Zacaro, the Mayor of Tela, Zacaro wasted no time in making the declaration. “We are very excited about this newly protected area,” he shared, “but we also understand the great responsibility that has been put upon our shoulders. We must work tirelessly together in order to ensure the future of this beautiful gift, so that future generations can also enjoy the benefits of our amazing reefs.” The protection of the reef area near Tela follows a significant decision made by the Honduran government earlier this year to designate Cordelia Banks a Site of Wildlife Importance. Located not far from Tela, off the southwest coast of Roatan, Honduras, Cordelia is home to one of the Caribbean’s largest known stands of staghorn coral—an IUCN-listed critically endangered species. Honduras, with the elkhorn coral at Tela and the staghorn coral in Cordelia, can now claim protections for significant populations of two endangered corals. Reports of Tela’s reefs are spreading quickly throughout the local tourism industry. Construction has just broke ground on the new Tela Marine Research Center. This facility is expected to serve as an educational resource for the greater public about coral reef conservation and will accommodate the needs of approximately 30 to 40 divers each day. Marcello Dicunta, a PADI dive instructor and owner of the Tela Dive Center, is looking forward to the possibilities arising from this discovery. “Seasoned divers will find Tela’s reef different from anything they have seen before. And because it’s so different, we need to ask important questions like why are the coral coverage and sea urchin populations thriving here. Compared to the rest of the Caribbean, Capiro Banks is a very healthy reef and it’s worth preserving so that we can spend time studying it.” Antal Borcsok, member of the Tela Chamber of Tourism’s Board of Directors, also sees tremendous potential for the area. “This incredible news has sent shock waves throughout the entrepreneurial veins of the people of Tela. We recognize how important it is to act quickly and responsibly to ensure a long-term, sustainable source of income for the community.” CORAL and its partners are already preparing for the potential impact that added dive tourism will have on the reefs near Tela. Recent programs include installing moorings to reduce anchor damage to sensitive reef habitats, training local marine operators and community teachers in sustainable marine recreation principles, and working with federal authorities to eventually designate Tela’s reefs a Site of Wildlife Importance. “It is critical that political and private interests align to protect these amazing reefs,” said Vasques. “We look forward to being involved in this locally-driven movement and are committed to helping the community of Tela protect its reefs.”"

        "content": "We recently held our annual State of the Reef Address, which highlighted the urgent need for action to protect coral reefs. Heather Starck, the Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, emphasized the devastating impact of climate change, overfishing, pollution, and other human activities on coral reefs around the world. Coral reefs are critical ecosystems that provide food and livelihoods for millions of people; their preservation is vital. Heather stressed that coral reefs are still in decline. This means that nearly 1 trillion dollars annually in food, tourism, and coastal protection are in jeopardy. Our science is telling us that 75% of reefs are currently threatened and this figure is anticipated to climb to 90% by 2030. “We’re also seeing that  in the Western Caribbean is spreading at 155 meters per day” according to Heather and the CORAL team scientists. This is a highly lethal disease that started in 2014 and continues to spread rapidly across the Caribbean. While there’s urgency to act, the team at CORAL has reason for hope. Starck shared with us that, “for example, 341 commitments worth nearly $20 billion were recently made at the   this month in Panama including funding for expanding and improving marine protected areas and biodiversity corridors.” We find hope in the fact that 193 countries within the UN agreed to the first of its kind high seas treaty to protect 30 percent of our lands and Oceans by 2030. Starck described CORAL’s science-based approach for addressing the needs of the world’s coral reefs. This includes supporting resilient coastal communities, reducing water pollution, and promoting sustainable fisheries – all of which we believe will allow coral reefs to adapt and survive as they face global climate change. Next  , CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, shared exciting updates on the progress made by her team in advancing the science around coral adaptation and evolution. This is in hopes that reefs to adapt to the environmental changes brought on by climate change. Dr. Fox’s team has been working with the  , a new resource that maps the world’s coral reefs and monitors their threats to provide actionable data and a shared understanding of coral ecosystems. CORAL is part of the Atlas partnership and is leading the coordination of the field component of coral bleaching monitoring program. One day, we hope to  that helps to improve the detection of bleaching events from space. The most engaging addition to the State of the Reef Address this year was live video streaming to field sites in both the Western Caribbean and Hawaii. , CORAL’s Conservation Program Director, and Francis Lam, Executive Director of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras, spoke about their work in the region. One of the main programs at the Roatan Marine Park is the patrol program, which has five boats of rangers who survey this protected marine zone and deter illegal fishing and other activities that counteract local community efforts to improve the environment. CORAL’s holistic approach to supporting local organizations has made a real difference in coral reef health in the Western Caribbean, as evidenced by the growth and impact of the Roatan Marine Park. Next we went to the Mauka (mountains) of Maui where our Hawaiian Islands Program Coordinator,  , and team are working on sedimentation, a critical issue in the Waikoli watershed of West Maui. They are decommissioning agricultural roads that run parallel to stream gulches and installing plants to trap the sediment.  Our approach is intended to be a long-term, nature-based solution to the problem of stormwater run-off depositing tons of sediment suffocating the corals. The Coral Reef Alliance plans to scale up its work to meet the growing needs of coral reefs, and the organization depends on the support of its community to succeed. The  , Kirby Ryan, expressed gratitude to everyone for their ongoing support and involvement in the Alliance’s work despite the challenges of the pandemic. Looking forward, we plan to continue urgent and important work to protect and restore coral reefs globally, with the hope of gaining more support from people who are interested in preserving this critical natural wonder that supports 25% of ocean life and hundreds of millions of people. CORAL’s 2023 State of the Reef Address has emphasized the pressing need for action to protect coral reefs. Through the work of scientists, conservationists, and local communities, we hope to preserve these critical ecosystems for future generations.

        "content": "In recent years, there’s been a growing demand for companies to assume responsibility for their environmental impact, driven by consumers who prioritize sustainable products. Failure to address these concerns puts companies at risk of losing market share to competitors who embrace sustainability. Say hello to Fresh Clean Threads, a clothing brand that understands the significance of sustainability and actively incorporates environmentally responsible practices into its business model. Dedicated to providing comfortable and affordable basics, Fresh Clean Threads has embarked on a journey towards becoming fully green within the next five years. To achieve this goal, they’re is implementing various measures. They’re reducing water usage in fabric dyeing, incorporating recycled polyester into their clothing production, eliminating single-use plastics, and adopting eco-friendly practices in their factories. These initiatives reflect their commitment to minimizing the negative impact on the world’s oceans, which face grave challenges from pollution, overfishing, climate change, consumerism, and unsustainable practices within the clothing and retail industry. Matthew Parvis, the Founder and Executive Director of Fresh Clean Threads, is a San Diego resident who considers the beach his backyard. When he and his wife, Melissa, established the business, they ensured environmental conservation became an integral part of their guiding principles. We have big aspirations to become a truly sustainable brand for the future, and we are spending a lot of time and resources to do this as quickly as we possibly can. But to do that we also have to be here as a business, so we call that being sustainably sustainable. The   collection aligns with their sustainability initiative aimed at minimizing its impact on the ocean. The two primary focuses are   and  . The collection takes an additional step by sourcing recycled polyester as its fabric. Regarding this deliberate product decision, Matthew Parvis acknowledges, “What we are truly striving for at Fresh Clean Threads is to introduce innovative technologies that enable us to ensure that this polyester has a significantly reduced environmental impact.” Fresh Clean Threads is deeply committed to reducing its plastic consumption, particularly in packaging and shipping materials. As part of their sustainability journey, the company has made significant changes, such as replacing traditional poly-mailers with compostable mailers made from cornstarch. These innovative mailers break down within months, in stark contrast to the hundreds of years conventional plastic takes to degrade. According to Matthew Parvis, this transition represents the “second step” in their pursuit of becoming fully green. The first step involves making meaningful contributions to ocean conservation efforts, exemplified by their support for organizations like CORAL. The third step will ensure sustainable practices throughout the fabric production process by carefully selecting factories that share their values, all of which forms a crucial part of their responsible approach. In addition to their packaging changes, Fresh Clean Threads has eliminated plastic tape, opting instead for fully recyclable water-activated paper tape. Plastic packaging for their products has been replaced with compostable bags made from plant-based materials. Despite recognizing that ethical considerations may not always be the primary factor in purchasing decisions, the company considers these choices as fundamental pillars of their brand. Matthew Parvis expresses a strong desire for greater awareness of environmental issues, including the detrimental impact of companies, to take center stage. In the past, the company has partnered with a handful of non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting the world’s oceans, and CORAL is grateful to now be a part of the Fresh Clean Threads community. Beyond donating a portion of its profits to CORAL and being our match donor for our springtime campaign, our partners have dedicated their   collection to our mission. This decision heightens the awareness and urgency for coral conservation and best practices to Fresh Clean Threads’ consumer base. In this way, Fresh Clean Threads is a part of the solution instead of part of the problem.    Fresh Clean Threads has recognized the importance of sustainability and is taking concrete steps to reduce its impact on the environment. The Fresh Clean Seas initiative, focused on reducing single-use plastic and supporting ocean conservation efforts, is an excellent example of how businesses can be environmentally responsible while still being profitable. The driving ideology behind the company is “clothes that don’t wear on the planet.” This statement goes beyond the physical article of clothing, which has the potential of influencing its consumers for the greater good. Awareness provides shoppers the opportunity to make environmentally sustainable decisions all while educating them about the need for coral reef conservation. CORAL is proud to align itself with Fresh Clean Threads, and we’re enthusiastic to see this partnership grow. Join us on our journey to make the ocean a healthier place for those that live above and below its surface."

The app is called   and it’s a tool being used by conservationists around the world to protect wildlife and its natural habitats.  Thanks to our local partners, dedicated patrol rangers, and your generous support, we are expanding access to this technology and using it to address illegal fishing in the Western Caribbean and protect the region’s coral reefs.  SMART improves the management of marine protected areas by allowing patrol rangers to track activities and record observations in one simple data system. With just the click of a button, we can now view valuable data that helps on-the-ground teams be proactive, strategic, and efficient when guarding marine protected areas.  By providing training and access to the tool, our local partners like the   and the   have improved their patrolling programs and can better protect waters that suffer from illegal fishing.  “We can get precise information and immediately download the reports that we need,” says Francis Leán, the executive director for the RMP. According to Leán, her team no longer relies on estimations and can now accurately analyze the number of illegal fishing incidents and species confiscated, in addition to the mileage covered and amount of fuel used by patrol rangers.  “By using this technology, we understand all the components involved in running a successful patrolling program,” says Pamela Ortega, CORAL’s program manager. “It helps make informed decisions and it can advise other communities or groups in the industry.”  An effective patrol program is important because it protects healthy fish populations, which greatly contribute to coral reef health. Herbivorous fish, like parrotfish or surgeonfish, graze on the seaweed that grows near reefs. When you remove too many of these fish from the environment, algae can take over reef-building corals and the ecosystem can quickly collapse. Overfishing impacts coral reefs and the species that rely on them, in addition to many coastal communities who depend on reef fish as a source of income and food. That’s why we are so committed to our   strategy which includes utilizing technology, implementing robust patrolling programs, and supporting local partners whose work directly impacts coral reef health. In the upcoming year, we hope to expand the use of SMART and offer more technical expertise to patrolling programs in the Western Caribbean. Thanks to generous donations, we are able to help local communities and our partners reach these goals and protect the coral reefs we know and love. "

        "content": "So, picture this: you’ve just arrived at your dream tropical destination, ready to explore the crystal-clear waters and the vibrant underwater world. As you strap on your snorkeling gear and dive into the ocean, you’re immediately transported into a magical world of colors and shapes. The water is warm, the sun is shining, and the fish are curiously swimming around you. You feel like you’re in a dream. But suddenly, something catches your eye. As you approach a group of corals, you notice that something’s not quite right. The once-vibrant pink and green hues have faded, and the coral looks pale, white even. You swim closer, hoping it’s just a trick of the light, but as you get nearer, the reality sinks in: the coral is bleached. Corals are animals, but they live in a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae. These algae provide the corals with food and oxygen, and in return, the corals provide them with a safe place to live. It’s a win-win situation! However, when corals are exposed to stressful conditions, such as high temperatures, pollution, or changes in the water’s chemistry, they expel the zooxanthellae. Without them, the coral loses its color and turns white, hence the term “bleaching.” Corals can not live very long in this state. But here’s the good news: coral bleaching doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the reef. If the stressor is removed in time, the zooxanthellae can come back and the corals can recover. Together, we should care about coral bleaching because coral reefs are essential to the health of our oceans and our planet. They provide a home and a source of food for countless species of fish and other marine creatures. They also protect coastlines from erosion and storms, and play a vital role in regulating the Earth’s climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. When coral reefs suffer, so do the ecosystems and the people that depend on them. Additionally, coral reefs are a stunning display of biodiversity and natural beauty, and their loss would be a tragedy for future generations. By taking action to prevent and mitigate coral bleaching, we can help protect one of our planet’s most precious resources. The   at the Coral Reef Alliance is focused on early detection of bleaching events so that we can identify reefs in need of our protection.  For example, if a bleaching event has started in an area with many tourist divers, we can influence local stakeholders to limit visitors to that reef until it can have time to recover. Through this program we have collaborators monitoring events in the water and we are also partnering with the   to help improve their satellite-based technology  to identify bleaching in near-real time. There are many things you can do to help protect coral reefs and prevent coral bleaching. One of the most important is to reduce your carbon footprint by using less energy and supporting policies that address climate change. You can also reduce your impact on coral reefs by being a responsible traveler, choosing reef-safe sunscreens and more sustainable seafood, and avoiding activities that can damage coral, such as anchoring on reefs or touching coral. Finally, you can support organizations like the Coral Reef Alliance that work to protect and restore coral reefs around the world.  Coral bleaching is a serious threat to coral reefs and the many species that depend on them. By understanding the causes and impacts of coral bleaching and taking action to reduce our impact on the environment, we can help protect these important ecosystems for generations to come."

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "On October 8th, the IPCC issued its special report on the impacts of global climate change on nature and society. Specifically, the IPCC examined the results of warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the context of the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. The report can be found at  . The report paints a grim picture of the consequences of climate change if the earth’s temperature rises by even 0.5°C and further states that rising temperatures will result in food shortages, more wildfires, and—of particular interest to us at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL)—a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Additionally, the report points out that the effects of climate change will not be disbursed uniformly across the globe. Rising temperatures will have a disproportionate impact on the poor as well as developing and island nations. CORAL works closely with many such communities around the world to implement solutions that are win-wins for both reefs and people. Many media outlets have covered the release of this report, and many have focused on the predictions of devastating effects to coral reefs. Some of the reports have shared inaccurate data about the current state of coral reefs and very few media outlets have publicized the work being done by CORAL and countless other conservation organizations around the world to save coral reefs. The IPCC’s special report is an urgent wake-up call for action. To save coral reefs, we must act on two fronts: we must swiftly and drastically   while simultaneously effectively  , such as from land-based sources of pollution and overfishing. Without effective action on both fronts in the next 20 years, we could be facing a world without functional coral reefs. CORAL has developed innovative, scientific solutions to meet this challenge. . A quarter of all marine life depends on coral reefs, and over 500 million people around the world rely on coral reefs for food security, economic well-being, and cultural identity. Goods and services—like tourism and fishing—derived from coral reefs have an estimated value of US$375 billion a year. Coral reefs are also critical for protecting coastal communities from wave action, erosion, and tropical storms. The world needs coral reefs, and decisive action will help ensure that we do not face a future without them. Many coral reefs around the globe are in a state of decline. Some recent reports in the media have stated that we have lost 50 percent of the world’s reefs already. The truth is more complicated. The combination of rising ocean temperatures and local reef threats has resulted in the loss of 50 percent of reef-building corals (as opposed to coral reefs) over the past 30 years and placed an estimated one-third of reef-building corals at risk of extinction. The good news is that there is hope for corals and coral reefs.  , but little is known about whether corals can adapt fast enough to keep up with the pace of climate change. Without this crucial information, pessimism can prevail, undermining motivation to implement effective conservation actions and governmental policies. CORAL is developing a new, scalable solution to meet the crisis facing our reefs, as described in the IPCC report, that will fill this knowledge gap. In partnership with world-class researchers, we are spearheading a multidisciplinary research project that is improving our understanding of how corals evolve in response to rising temperatures. We are using this scientific information to develop regional-scale conservation plans that we are implementing in collaboration with local communities in  ,  ,   and  . Our scientific research shows that the best way to give corals a fighting chance is by facilitating the natural process of evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue happens when a population in decline is able to survive because individuals that are naturally better suited to deal with new conditions breed to regrow the population. In essence, evolution rescues the population before it goes extinct. We have used our scientific research to define the attributes of networks that increase the probability of evolutionary rescue. We call these networks “Adaptive Reefscapes”. An Adaptive Reefscape is a network of healthy reefs that is diverse, connected, and large.  To learn more about Adaptive Reefscapes go to:  . A key element of Adaptive Reefscapes is that they are based on portfolio theory—the idea that investing in a diverse range of options for the future increases the chances for success. This contrasts with other approaches that use inherently uncertain forecasts to focus conservation efforts on particular geographic locations and/or species. Such strategies are intrinsically risky. Adaptive Reefscapes also contrasts with approaches that are over-reliant on technology which, given the short window of time and resource constraints, are unlikely to achieve meaningful results for reefs at a global scale. Given the rapid pace of climate change and its drastic effects, we can no longer rely on standard approaches to conservation that assume we know what the future will bring or that strive to return systems to the way they once were. We need innovative solutions that instead embrace the idea of change and harness evolutionary power. To address the crisis we face, we need a solution that can scale globally in a relatively short period and with limited resources. At CORAL, we have that solution.

        "content": "Coral reefs are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, providing critical habitat for countless species of fish, invertebrates, and other marine life. Unfortunately, coral reefs are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms. This has led to a decline in the health and resilience of many coral reefs, which in turn has negatively impacted the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them for food, income, and cultural identity. To address these challenges, a team of researchers from University of Leeds (UK), Coral Reef Alliance (USA), Rare (Philippines & Indonesia), Pattimura University (Indonesia), and many other partners are  . These two nations are part of “The Coral Triangle” – a region in the western Pacific Ocean that is known for its incredible marine biodiversity and rich coral reef ecosystems. It is often referred to as the “Amazon of the Seas” due to its vast array of marine life and is considered one of the most important and diverse marine regions on Earth.  The new project is called  Led by Dr. Maria Beger of University of Leeds, Rocky Sanchez-Tirona of Rare, Dr. Gino Limmon of Pattimura University, and Dr. Helen Fox of CORAL, the project will   that depend on them. In particular, Climate REEFS aims to both develop techniques to identify adaptive reefs using remote sensing technologies and characterize how gender and social status shape socio-economic vulnerabilities and the ability to adapt to reef degradation. Its ultimate goal is to strengthen community capacity for sustainable fisheries and to improve management of coral reef marine protected areas (MPAs). Climate REEFS will involve a range of activities, including social science research to identify climate vulnerability and gender- and socially inclusive adaptation pathways. It also involves geospatial research to detect adaptive reefs from satellite-derived data, as well as ecological and genomic research to pilot an analysis that tests the interplay of adaptiveness from genes to people. All activities will be conducted at a small scale, with the goal of training the team in key research techniques and identifying policy opportunities that will enable future expansion. Climate REEFS officially kicked off in the city of Cebu, the Philippines, where partners met from July 3 – 5 to discuss major work packages, finalize project timelines, and flesh out plans for the start of gathering data in the field, among other agenda items. The project team is currently working to select field sites for ecological coral reef surveys off the island of Leyte in the Philippines and is also working with nearby coastal communities. It’s expected that similar efforts will begin off the island of Ambon, Indonesia in October.   You can help us expand our work in the Coral Triangle by following the Climate REEFS project and sharing about it with friends, family, and followers. The more people who know about this work, the better. We’re confident this sharing of knowledge will influence how other communities manage their coral reef resources and influence donors to fund coral conservation and science."

        "content": "In the crystal clear waters surrounding Molokai, the legacy of Ka Honua Momona (KHM) spans generations, rooted in the island’s rich heritage. Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and Ka Honua Momona have recently joined hands in a shared commitment to preserving Hawaii’s precious coastal ecosystems. Their partnership aims to safeguard Molokai’s southern fringing reefs, a mission deeply woven into the longstanding dedication of KHM to this land. Hawaii’s coral reefs are not merely underwater ecosystems; they’re the lifeblood of the islands, sustaining nature, economy, and culture. The reefs of Molokai, with their rich biodiversity and cultural significance, face a looming crisis. Invasive species, mismanaged land, and unsustainable fishing are threatening to irreversibly damage these precious ecosystems, jeopardizing not only marine life but also the traditions, livelihoods, and well-being of the local communities. Studies by scientists at the University of Hawaii’s Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program have shown that south Molokai has the best coral coverage in the main eight Hawaiian Islands. Yet the impacts from sediment run-off into the nearshore ecosystem have caused areas of degradation of the south Molokai reef, affecting fish and coral habitats. Coral and fish larvae from this island are dispersed across Maui Nui and Oahu, helping to build resilience across a larger area. Molokai’s south shore is a close-knit community, primarily home to native Hawaiians whose families have lived on the island for generations. They’re deeply committed to preserving their unique Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions. Unfortunately, the island faces challenges due to limited job opportunities, leading to high unemployment rates and many residents living below the poverty line. Most available jobs are in agriculture, mainly with external companies managing plantations on the island. The community is aging as younger generations leave in search of better prospects. By teaming up with KHM for this project, we aim to support the community in maintaining their vital sources of food and income. Additionally, our research will assist in developing strategies for a sustainable future. The CORAL-KHM fishpond restoration project is a lifeline thrown into troubled waters, aiming to set Molokai’s reefs on a course of resilience and sustainability. Revitalizing two fishponds—named Alii and Kalokoeli—will significantly enhance the long-term health of the coral reefs along Molokai’s south shore.  This restoration effort involves removing invasive algae, reintroducing native plant species, and rejuvenating fish ponds to boost the fish population, which is crucial for nurturing healthy coral habitats. By creating healthier reef ecosystems, we’re not only promoting resilience but also fortifying the region against the impact of storms, hurricanes, and rising sea levels. Molokai hosts coral species found nowhere else in the world. We must protect these endemic species from extinction, ensuring the survival of unique marine life integral to the delicate balance of the ecosystem. Beyond ecological considerations, the project recognizes the intrinsic link between healthy reefs and Hawaiian culture. The revival of the reefs is an endeavor to safeguard cultural practices, ceremonies, and the traditional gathering of marine resources that have sustained communities for generations. We’ll be working in tight partnership with KHM whose staff have lineal ties to place and have kuleana (responsibility) in caring for Alii and Kalokoeli fishponds, which are community treasures and sources of education, food, cultural renewal and connection. As a result of this project’s efforts to improve habitat for fish and wildlife, we anticipate a simultaneous enhancement of community resilience. By addressing land mismanagement, invasive species, and sediment pollution, the project also aims to secure the economic lifeline that Molokai’s reefs provide. A thriving marine ecosystem provides a sustainable source of income and food for local communities. Hunting, fishing, and farming account for providing 33% of the island community’s food needs, and this reef is one of the major food sources for Molokai’s subsistence economy. As climate change intensifies, coral reefs face unprecedented challenges. One of our goals is to create conditions that enable reefs to adapt to the changing climate, ensuring their resilience in the face of warming oceans and other climate-related stressors. This includes healthy fish populations, as well as clean water free of sedimentation. Our future plans include establishing water quality monitoring protocols to ensure the reefs have proper conditions, as well as education around restoration and sustainable initiatives on the island. Through fishpond restoration, water quality monitoring, and community capacity-building, the CORAL-KHM partnership is not just about addressing immediate threats but building a foundation for long-term coral reef management. It’s a commitment to a sustainable future where Molokai’s reefs thrive, supporting ecosystems, cultures, and economies for generations to come."

The document is straightforward and provides a way for everyone to draw from the same framework and toward the same goal…to save our reefs from contaminants deriving from poor water quality. This protocol was made possible by multiple partners and monitoring efforts across 90 sites in Mexico, Belize, and Honduras. We’re happy to share our universal water quality monitoring protocol that can be used anywhere and everywhere reefs exist. This labor of love has been a group effort for over a decade, and we believe this protocol will make an immediate impact when implemented correctly and consistently. Reef health is getting worse as years go by. In order to minimize stressors to the reef, we must first understand the cause. Is the decline caused by a lack of fish? Pollution? Sanitation issues? In recent years, the MAR has been facing a major challenge – an increase in macroalgae that threatens its coral reefs. These blooms grow on corals, prevent larval settlement, and compete for space. This is due to low herbivore populations and nutrient contamination from wastewater management and agricultural activities. To tackle this problem,  . The program is divided into two phases:  focuses on quantifying the human impacts derived from wastewater in priority sites where tourism has the most impact. Control sites that aren’t influenced by tourism-related fluctuations will also be included to provide quantitative data.   will expand the sampling sites to assess nutrient enrichment from other sources.  Five sampling locations have been identified in each of the three most tourism-affected MAR countries – Honduras, Belize, and Mexico. These will be divided into three locations impacted by tourism and two control locations. Water quality parameters will be sampled monthly to quantify any changes in water quality. This handbook was created for anyone who wants to get involved in water quality management.   We believe that a consistent approach to monitoring water quality can lead to more resilient reefs. By monitoring marine water quality, we can assess the health of our oceans and human impact on our marine ecosystem. This helps us to implement mitigation actions to prevent environmental degradation and protect marine life. Let’s all do our part to protect our oceans and preserve them for generations to come!"

        "content": "When improperly treated sewage enters the marine environment, it can have devastating effects on a coral reef. Not only does it bring bacteria that can pose a threat to human health, but it also brings nutrients that fuel the growth of algae—a fierce competitor in the coral reef ecosystem. Algae compete with corals for space, and if not controlled, can quickly overtake a coral reef ecosystem. That’s why at CORAL we focus so heavily on making sure corals have the clean, clear water they need to thrive. And it’s why we’ve been partnering with the local community in West End, Roatán, Honduras since 2013 to help   to ensure the plant is operational and homes are connected to it. It’s working—together with our partners, we decreased the amount of bacteria in the nearshore waters of Half Moon Bay by more than 98 percent between 2013 and 2020. The water along the coast of western Roatán is once again healthy and clean. “The numbers are amazing,” said Dr. Antonella Rivera, CORAL’s Principal Investigator in Honduras. “There is a huge difference in the before and after. It’s hard to believe it can actually happen in such a short period of time, and it’s also very fulfilling and motivating for me to see. You think you’ll see a little bit of change, but not of that magnitude.” These impressive statistics are proof that partnering with communities and making long-term investments to improve local conditions can pay big dividends for coral reefs, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Water quality has improved so much that West End has been  , a third-party certification that recognizes safe, accessible and sustainable beaches. This is a huge success for the people who swim, play, and work in these waters—they now have clean water and don’t have to worry about getting sick. But these remarkable improvements are also helping coral reefs become healthier. Though further research is needed, our scientists believe there’s a link between water quality and coral disease, which stresses corals and can lead to bleaching. When sewage pollution decreased in Half Moon Bay, the prevalence of coral disease also decreased. From 2011 to 2016, coral disease dropped from 25 percent to zero in the region, leading our researchers to believe that the pathogens and nutrients in untreated wastewater are harmful to corals’ health. “Before we started monitoring in Half Moon Bay, the level of disease was very high,” Dr. Rivera said. “But we’ve monitored that with our partners, Healthy Reefs Initiative, every two years and, in 2016 and 2018, disease levels had gone down to zero. We can’t say that this is conclusively because of water quality improvements—disease can also happen because of other stressors such as climate change and other types of pollutants—but reducing the amount of sewage in the ocean likely contributes to making cleaner, healthier water for these coral reefs so they can be healthy and disease-free.” To address this, Dr. Rivera is leading efforts to expand water quality testing in the Mesoamerican region to give us a better understanding of sewage-related impacts on the coral reef ecosystem."

The 5-week class, Reef-Friendly Shoreline Innovations, is designed to teach watershed stewardship and landscape design principles to shoreline property owners in an effort to reduce threats to Maui’s coral reefs. According to an economic valuation study conducted in 2002, Hawaiian coral reefs contribute an average of $364 million annually to the Hawaiian economy. But coral reefs around the Main Hawaiian Islands are being threatened by poor water quality, much of which is caused by rainwater running off of the land and entering the marine environment, bringing with it pesticides, herbicides, nutrients, and sediment—all of which are harmful to reefs. “In this course we’ll talk a lot about Low Impact Design, which focuses on using plants and landscape designs to catch stormwater and prevent it from entering our oceans,” says Wes Crile, Hawai‘i field manager for CORAL and one of the course instructors. “The concepts are incredibly easy to implement, and can really help Maui’s reefs recover from a lot of the stress they’ve been under.” The new Reef-Friendly Shoreline Innovations course will cater to shoreline property owners, managers, landscapers, and residents interested in reef-friendly landscaping. The course will cover the fundamentals of Low Impact Design (LID), irrigation management, plant selection, visitor and community engagement, and more. Field trips to visit reef-friendly landscapes at various hotels are included. The class will take place on Thursday afternoons from 2:00-4:30pm, from April 23 to May 21, 2015.

The report puts forth a formal recommendation for a new, community-wide sewage treatment facility. Over the years, Puakō residents noticed a decline in reef health and came together to protect their reef, enlisting researchers and local nonprofit organizations to assist in their efforts. In response, CORAL formed and facilitates the Clean Water for Reefs Puakō project and   to ensure a broad and collective voice among the community and local partners. The  , completed by AQUA Engineering, a respected firm that specializes in wastewater treatment, is a thorough analysis of three potential wastewater treatment solutions for the Puakō community, including Aerobic Treatment Units (ATUs), connection to the Kalahuipua’a Lagoons (Mauna Lani) facility, and a dedicated onsite treatment facility. “The onsite treatment facility will provide the best environmental results for the Puakō community and its reefs,” said Erica Perez, Hawai‘i program manager for CORAL, “It also has the highest treatment quality and the lowest 20-year life cycle cost, with 100 percent effluent reuse.” A key challenge for wastewater treatment in Puakō is the proximity of residential properties to the shoreline, combined with the geology—very porous volcanic rock and high groundwater. This means that any polluted water released from residential treatment units can make its way to the reefs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated the South Kohala region, including Puakō, as a Coral Priority Management Site through its Habitat Blueprint initiative. The Puakō reef is also recognized by The State Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) and the South Kohala Coastal Partnership as a priority area for ridge-to-reef management through the South Kohala Conservation Action Plan. Next steps for the project include securing necessary land and permits, determining management and ownership options, outlining funding avenues, and a developing a long-term monitoring plan and citizen science group.

        "category": null,
        "content": "Monday, July 1, 2019 — A   released today in Nature Climate Change gives hope for coral reefs. The pioneering study launched by the Coral Reef Alliance is one of the first to demonstrate that management that takes evolution and adaptation into account can help rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change. Importantly, the results show that by making smart decisions to protect reefs today, conservation managers can generate the conditions that can help corals adapt to rising temperatures. “It is well documented that climate change is causing corals to die off at an unprecedented rate, but our study provides tools that offer promise for their survival,” stated Dr. Madhavi Colton, co-author and Program Director at the Coral Reef Alliance. “Our results show that when evolution is enabled, conservation efforts can help corals adapt to rising temperatures.” Contrary to approaches that are popular today, such as focusing protection on reefs in cooler water, the study shows that protecting diverse reef habitat types across a spectrum of ocean conditions is key to helping corals adapt to climate change. “We found that a diversity of reef types provides the variety that evolution depends on,” explained co-author Malin Pinsky, Associate-Professor at Rutgers University. “Hot sites are important sources of heat-tolerant corals, while cold sites and those in between can become important future habitats. Together, a diversity of reef types act as stepping stones that give corals the best chance for adapting and moving as climate changes.” Key to successful evolution is management that improves local conditions for reefs by effectively reducing local stressors, such as overfishing and water pollution. However, the authors caution that not all management strategies are created equal. “We used mathematical models to test the effects of management choices on coral reef outlooks,” stated Dr. Tim Walsworth, lead author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington. “We found that corals in well-managed areas act a source of baby corals in the future, essentially rescuing reefs after the climate stabilizes. Without both evolution and management, the corals in our model were unable to survive rising temperatures.” Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and support the livelihoods of over 500 million people. Globally, they are estimated to be worth US$375 billion per year. The study shows that managing reefs to facilitate evolution today and in the future can enhance their prospects for long-term survival. This means creating managed area networks that contain a diversity of coral types and habitats and that effectively reduce local stressors. “This study shows that we know enough of the science to act—and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste,” says Dr. Colton.

        "content": "Thursday, October 1, 2020 10-year-old Abby Rogers has converted her backyard into a native plant nursery to help save coral reefs. Rogers is a volunteer with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), helping to grow native plants that will be transplanted at their stream restoration site in Wahikuli. The native plants trap sediment that runs off the slope and into the ocean where it smothers coral reefs. Typically, CORAL purchases the plants and hosts volunteer planting days at the stream restoration site. But when COVID-19 restrictions hit and the group planting days were no longer safe, the team put a call out to volunteers to grow the plants at home from seed. “I really wanted to do things for the environment, but had not found a way to really help besides not using a straw or bringing my own bags to the store,” says Rogers. “My mom read about [the CORAL project] in a newspaper article and suggested it to me.” Originally, Rogers signed up to take home three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But once she realized how much fun it was, she signed up for 15 more kits. That brings her total to 900 native plants. Rogers has certainly taken the plunge into her first-ever volunteer project. “I have always been interested in the environment because I have always wanted to help the world,” says the 5 th grader. “I spent seven years in China, where I learned firsthand about air and water pollution. Now, living in Hawai‘i, I have been looking for ways I can make a positive impact on the environment.” Rogers is one of 100 volunteers who signed up to grow 25,000 seeds for CORAL. Since not all seeds tend to germinate, CORAL estimates that about 10,000 plants will ultimately be transplanted. “She’s our most prolific volunteer,” says Larissa Treese, CORAL’s Program Coordinator on Maui and the coordinator behind the at-home plant growing volunteer program. “It’s so great seeing the next generation stepping up to save coral reefs—the amount of sediment we’ll be able to trap with the plants she’s growing will definitely have an impact.” Once a volunteer signs up to participate, CORAL provides them with the seeds and instructions on how to grow them. Volunteers can choose whether to donate the rest of the supplies (soil, trays and pots) or whether to borrow them from CORAL. Once the plants are fully grown, the volunteer can return them to CORAL to be transplanted or they can visit the restoration site and transplant them themselves. CORAL has been engaged in slope restoration in West Maui for several years, using native plants and trees to restore Maui’s once lush forests and reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. The key to CORAL’s success is building strong local partnerships. The restoration project in Wahikuli is a testament to that, bringing together partners like Maui Nui Botanical Gardens, West Maui Ridge 2 Reef and Down the Hatch. “The at-home native plant kits have been a terrific way to bring the community together and keep our volunteers engaged, since we can’t meet in person anymore,” says Treese. “It’s also helped us save the money that we would typically spend on purchasing the fully grown plants.” To sign up to volunteer and receive your own at-home native planting kit, email Larissa Treese at ltreese@coral.org. This project is funded by Hawai‘i Tourism Authority and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is a nonprofit focused on saving the world’s coral reefs. At the local level, CORAL partners with communities in Hawai‘i and Honduras to design lasting conservation programs that protect both the coral reefs and the communities that depend upon them.

        "content": "September 9, 2014   Nyoman Sugiarta, a fisherman from Bali, has been selected by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) as the inaugural 2014 CORAL Conservation Prize winner. Sugiarta will receive $20,000 for his leadership and dedication protecting coral reefs, and will travel to the United States later this month to collect his prize. “The CORAL Conservation Prize celebrates some of the most remarkable coral reef conservation leaders and provides them with necessary resources to continue their important work,” says CORAL’s Executive Director Michael Webster. “We’re excited to have Nyoman as the inaugural winner, and hope his successful conservation program can offer guidance and inspiration to other leaders around the world.” Sugiarta was chosen for his work protecting and monitoring coral reefs off the coast of Bondalem, Bali. With the support of Reef Check Indonesia, Sugiarta and his team have built a strong network of support for reef protection and have created a marine protected area (MPA). “At first, I didn’t know much about coral reefs and didn’t know why Reef Check Indonesia was coming to my village. They kept trying to tell us corals were important for the fish and for providing protection against waves,” says Sugiarta. “But now I understand what corals are, and how important they are.” Sugiarta volunteers his time monitoring reefs with Reef Check Indonesia, and is the leader of the MPA’s citizen enforcement team. He and his team have set up a successful monitoring program for their MPA, and patrol the beach regularly. They also conduct regular underwater cleanups. Sugiarta is dedicated to supporting fishermen, and encourages more sustainable fishing practices. “The reef looks much better now than it did before we created the MPA because we stopped fisherman from neighboring villages from using cyanide poison on the reef,” says Sugiarta. “We also stopped fishermen from using bottom nets, which, as far as I know, damage the reef and the environment permanently.” The area currently has two fish aggravating devices (FADs), designed to decrease the local fishing pressure on reef fish. The FADs, built by Sugiarta and his team, attract pelagic fish; research has found them to be very successful in providing more fishing opportunities for fishermen, while simultaneously taking pressure off near-shore reef fish populations. Sugiarta has big plans to put his prize money back into his program. “I want to buy mooring buoys to mark the MPA boundaries, and I want to buy a patrol boat complete with an outboard machine. I also want to develop a program for elementary schools to be able to come to the area and learn about conservation.” Additionally, he hopes to use part of his new funds to build four more FADs and continue supporting the Bondalem fishing community. CORAL will present Sugiarta with his award on September 20, 2014 at the CORAL 20  Anniversary Gala at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. It will be Sugiarta’s first trip to the United States, and he couldn’t be more excited. “I can’t sleep at night because I know I’m coming to the big country,” says Sugiarta. “I still feel like I’m dreaming.” To learn more about Sugiarta and the CORAL 20  Anniversary Gala, visit  .   The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) unites communities to save coral reefs.

        "content": "October 28, 2014 According to a new publication by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), protecting coral reefs and the natural environment can help hotel’s grow their business. Ecotourists have higher incomes than regular tourists on average, and they tend to spend more money while traveling. Attracting this growing market could help hotels increase their bottom line. Over $24 billion was spent in 2005 on ecotourism—and in a 2007 study by the Center for Responsible Travel, 54 percent of respondents said they would be more likely to patronize hotels and resorts that were environmentally responsible. Today’s tourists are seeking genuine natural experiences, and they’re becoming more aware and discerning of false environmental advertising, or greenwashing. Additionally, healthy reefs and clean water are essential to maintaining Hawai‘i’s allure as a destination—80 percent of Hawai‘i’s nearly 8 million annual visitors engage in marine-related recreational activities during their stay. The new Hawai‘i Hotel Reef Stewardship Guide is designed to help hotels adopt practices that protect coral reefs and attract this growing number of tourists interested in supporting environmentally-friendly businesses. The new guide by CORAL, available for free download at  , outlines practical steps hotels can take to become coral reef stewards, such as reducing land-based pollution and engaging and educating their guests. To receive a hardcopy of this guide, those within the South Kohala accommodations sector—including property division managers, maintenance and facility personnel, and elected homeowner association board members—are invited to a free workshop to learn more about reef stewardship. Participants will learn about attracting eco-friendly travelers, becoming a certified environmentally-friendly business, saving money through reef stewardship, and the history of the local shoreline and Hawaiian culture. The workshop will take place on Wednesday, November 12, 2014 from 8:30am-4:30pm at the Ka‘upulehu Interpretive Center in Kailua-Kona. Interested attendees should RSVP by November 3 to Erica Perez at   or 808.494.5770. Lunch and refreshments will be provided. CORAL unites communities to save coral reefs.

        "content": "Thanks to David Welder for asking about the difference between parrotfish and wrasses; he thought the image on the coin looked remarkably like a Maori wrasse ( ) and was curious about how they are related to the humphead parrotfish. Turns out it looked like a Maori wrasse because it is one! We obviously did not examine the mouth on the fish closely enough. These wrasses have large, succulent lips, not the toothier grins of the reef-grinding parrotfish.   Maori wrasse is a common name for several different species of wrasse.   (the Fijian species on the coin) is also confusingly known as the Napoleon wrasse, humphead wrasse, Napoleon fish, and Napoleonfish.  Wrasses belong to the family Labridae, and the Maori wrasse is the largest living member of the family. Males can be as long as six feet, and females about three feet. Males change color, from electric blue to pale green, blue-green, or purplish blue; females and juveniles are red-orange above and red-orange to white below. Although wrasses are long-lived, they are slow breeders, and their numbers have declined due to intensive fishing pressures, collection for aquariums, and habitat destruction and degradation, among other problems.   Though long been considered a different family, because of genetic similarities many scientists now regard parrotfish as a subfamily of Labridae.   Here is a selection of some of the other questions we received—and answers from CORAL’s experts.   The answer to this question is more complicated than you might think! It depends on the species of parrotfish—and how big they are. Scientists estimate that one stoplight parrotfish can process and generate about 0.6 pounds of sand per day on average.   Some species of parrotfish produce mucus from glands behind their gills, secrete it from their mouths, and then spread it over their bodies and heads, creating a sleeping bag or cocoon that protects them from tiny blood-sucking shrimp-like parasites at night—similar to people using mosquito nets. Sleeping fish are particularly vulnerable to parasites at night when cleaner fish and shrimp are off the clock. Studies show that when the fish are not protected by their mucus cocoons, their parasite loads increase by about nine-fold. And if a predator like a moray eel nudges the protective membrane of the cocoon, parrotfish can feel this vibration and flee. Parrotfish spend about 2.5 percent of their daily energy budget to create their nighttime protection systems.         Of course! Most of our projects are located in areas where tourism represents a significant part of the local economy, so you can definitely visit them. We have been working longest with the Kubulau community in Fiji, where the nearby Namena Marine Reserve shows high fish biomass and diversity compared to sites nearby that don’t enjoy the same level of protection. Trips to Namena can be arranged from resorts in Savusavu or enjoyed from live-aboards in the area. Another great option is the West End of Roatan, Honduras, where—thanks in part to our work with the Roatan Marine Park—fish populations are rebounding. For a special treat, arrange a trip to Cordelia Banks—the coral cover will blow your mind."

That struggle resolved itself for me during a recent trip to Honduras; I joined members of our staff and Board on a field visit to learn more about our current and future projects there.

Jenny met her years ago at a workshop, and—unbeknownst to Pamela at the time—identified her then as someone she’d bring on to the Honduran team as soon as funding was available. It’s a fact that all of these people are exceptional and worthy of recognition—but it’s also true that their current success was spawned by CORAL. By providing micro-grants, helping them build capacity with tools or trainings, or sharing additional targeted resources, CORAL—through Jenny—has catalyzed the work of these individuals and helped put into place a skilled and diverse team fighting for Honduras’s reefs. Without these passionate, local activists—without all of us working together—coral reef conservation would not be happening at the scale or the rate it is in Honduras.

        "content": "The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), our partners in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and the people of Roatán celebrated a major win as a decade of work recently came to fruition when the island passed clean water standards for the first time since monitoring began in 2013. The island of Roatán, part of the Bay Islands of Honduras, is world-renowned for its colorful reefs, white sand beaches, and clear waters. Over a million tourists visit this small island each year, contributing over 1 billion US dollars to the Honduran economy. About a decade ago, CORAL and partners realized that polluted ocean water in Roatán was beginning to threaten coral reef health and human health — and with it, the tourism industry and local economy. CORAL began working with the communities of West End and Half Moon Bay on Roatán, where – due to a lack of funding and few alternatives – the majority of homes and businesses were discharging their wastewater directly into the environment, resulting in unsafe levels of fecal bacteria along the coast. CORAL and partners stepped in to help resolve chronic ocean pollution problems resulting from wastewater by conducting water quality monitoring, building the capacity of local organizations to manage water resources, and connecting nearly 300 homes and businesses to a nearby wastewater treatment facility. [Best_Wordpress_Gallery id=”23″ gal_title=”Wastewater Treatment in Roatán”] Today, the water in Roatán is now passing clean water standards, with a 95% reduction in fecal bacteria since our water quality monitoring began in 2013. The amount of raw sewage discharged into the coastal environment has been reduced by nearly 30 million gallons per year. Ninety-seven percent of the homes and businesses that can be connected to a water treatment facility are connected. As a result of providing clean water, the most recent coral health survey showed a dramatic drop in coral disease from 25% in 2011 to zero in 2018. CORAL proudly celebrated the declaration of West End as a Blue Flag beach last year. Blue Flag certification comes from a third party that validates marine water quality, freshwater availability, and garbage disposal practices. This is a remarkable achievement, as West End previously did not pass safe swimming standards. Our success in Roatán is a rallying cry for others across the Bay Islands and Honduras to tackle this issue, and we are seeing results as government entities, local communities, and the private sector are increasing their commitment to addressing wastewater issues. We’re continuing to work closely with these stakeholders to improve local conditions and provide clean water for coral reefs in the region. Efforts like these are creating the local conditions that allow healthy corals to thrive, and because this work is part of a network, these reefs contribute to adaptation and repopulation of corals across the entire Mesoamerican Reef system. We will continue to support our local partners in their efforts to reduce local stressors so that corals can adapt to the effects of climate change and continue to support the people of the Mesoamerican Region."

        "content": "When improperly treated sewage enters the marine environment, it can have devastating effects on a coral reef. Not only does it bring bacteria that can pose a threat to human health, but it also brings nutrients that fuel the growth of algae—a fierce competitor in the coral reef ecosystem. Algae compete with corals for space, and if not controlled, can quickly overtake a coral reef ecosystem. That’s why at CORAL we focus so heavily on making sure corals have the clean, clear water they need to thrive. And it’s why we’ve been partnering with the local community in West End, Roatán, Honduras since 2013 to help   to ensure the plant is operational and homes are connected to it. It’s working—together with our partners, we decreased the amount of bacteria in the nearshore waters of Half Moon Bay by more than 98 percent between 2013 and 2020. The water along the coast of western Roatán is once again healthy and clean. “The numbers are amazing,” said Dr. Antonella Rivera, CORAL’s Principal Investigator in Honduras. “There is a huge difference in the before and after. It’s hard to believe it can actually happen in such a short period of time, and it’s also very fulfilling and motivating for me to see. You think you’ll see a little bit of change, but not of that magnitude.” These impressive statistics are proof that partnering with communities and making long-term investments to improve local conditions can pay big dividends for coral reefs, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Water quality has improved so much that West End has been  , a third-party certification that recognizes safe, accessible and sustainable beaches. This is a huge success for the people who swim, play, and work in these waters—they now have clean water and don’t have to worry about getting sick. But these remarkable improvements are also helping coral reefs become healthier. Though further research is needed, our scientists believe there’s a link between water quality and coral disease, which stresses corals and can lead to bleaching. When sewage pollution decreased in Half Moon Bay, the prevalence of coral disease also decreased. From 2011 to 2016, coral disease dropped from 25 percent to zero in the region, leading our researchers to believe that the pathogens and nutrients in untreated wastewater are harmful to corals’ health. “Before we started monitoring in Half Moon Bay, the level of disease was very high,” Dr. Rivera said. “But we’ve monitored that with our partners, Healthy Reefs Initiative, every two years and, in 2016 and 2018, disease levels had gone down to zero. We can’t say that this is conclusively because of water quality improvements—disease can also happen because of other stressors such as climate change and other types of pollutants—but reducing the amount of sewage in the ocean likely contributes to making cleaner, healthier water for these coral reefs so they can be healthy and disease-free.” To address this, Dr. Rivera is leading efforts to expand water quality testing in the Mesoamerican region to give us a better understanding of sewage-related impacts on the coral reef ecosystem."

By providing micro-grants, helping them build capacity with tools or trainings, or sharing additional targeted resources, CORAL—through Jenny—has catalyzed the work of these individuals and helped put into place a skilled and diverse team fighting for Honduras’s reefs. Without these passionate, local activists—without all of us working together—coral reef conservation would not be happening at the scale or the rate it is in Honduras. It is the only time in my life I’ve actually seen that one plus one can equal three—and CORAL, thanks to our supporters, is significantly responsible for that.   "

        "content": "The social sciences have historically been more intertwined with terrestrial conservation than with their marine counterpart. The notion of incorporating social science into conservation efforts began with the concept of Integrated Conservation and Development Programs (ICDPs), which aimed to simultaneously meet development and conservation goals. While the results of these projects were mixed, it remains a commonly used concept, carried out under the more commonly known term of  “community-based natural resource management” or “community-based conservation.” Through these programs, conservation groups, particularly in the developing world, are increasingly incorporating social needs into their strategies. Socially integrative concepts like co-management, Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFs), and Rapid Assessment techniques are now more prevalent in coral reef conservation as well. All of these structures and tools incorporate social science principles. Today it seems that taking human needs and desires into account is recognized as being irrevocably linked to conservation, yet community members are still sometimes brought in as an afterthought. Pursuing conservation is inherently a social endeavor, which means that taking humans into account as part of the ecosystem is invaluable to our work as conservationists. As our field staff around the world can attest, entering a community with preconceived ideas and plans doesn’t always work out. Particularly when dealing with marine conservation and a local community that depends on the resources of the sea, our approach must be open and humble. As referenced in a recent paper by Hicks et al.,  “human values need to be considered in all decision-making”–and these values and priorities can differ greatly. CORAL has found that entering a community with an active ear, ready to work with all stakeholders to find common ground, is the best approach. When working with different cultures it is easy to project our own perceptions onto a situation. Instead, the community’s interpretations, perceptions, and desires must be expressed, understood, and incorporated from the beginning. CORAL adopts these lessons from social science and employs them in our approach. This framework for engagement can be seen in our programs in Fiji, Honduras, and Indonesia. In these countries, we have worked alongside and in collaboration with local communities, ensuring that their concerns and needs receive priority. In Fiji, we consulted with community members and local stakeholders numerous times in designing a user fee system that respected their goals and authorities. The result was a broadly accepted program that achieved high local compliance. Conservation success can never be achieved without the compliance and support of human beings. Conducting socioeconomic studies and engaging the community prior to coming to conclusions regarding problems and solutions ensures that the actual and perceived issues are addressed, with collaboration and buy-in from all.

After his teacher decided to hold a Tzedakah (in Hebrew, “doing a good deed”) and parents created a fund to benefit nonprofit organizations, the 30 students in Gavin’s grade researched a variety of potential beneficiaries, then gave presentations about them. The students gave each of the nonprofits a donation, but chose three favorites to receive the largest awards. Gavin’s choice, CORAL, came in third, and on January 23, he presented CORAL’s Executive Director, Dr. Michael Webster, with a check for $725. Gavin says he “thought CORAL looked the best” of the coral reef conservation organizations he researched. In his five-page essay assignment, he writes, “People are not doing much about the dying coral reefs, but the Coral Reef Alliance is working to end this… Do you want your children, or your children’s children to see the beautiful coral reefs, or do you want it to be a story, something you wouldn’t be able to go and see? You and I might not be able to witness a change in our lives, but if we act strongly and carefully, there might be a future for the coral reefs.” Gavin says he is motivated by his love for all animals-from his two cats to the tiny fish and other creatures that live on coral reefs. He was taught since pre-kindergarten that “everything counts” and needs to be treated with respect. After seeing a documentary at the California Academy of Sciences about coral reefs, he realized that “we have only a certain amount of time to save them. I learned that lots of animals’ lives depend on the reef … The future of coral reefs around the world is in our own hands.”"

The environment is a job for everybody; we need to stop blaming and judging each other and work together.” Nan is walking that talk in Indonesia-and she’s having a lot of success. In 2013, after years of advocacy, CORAL, Conservation International, and The Nature Conservancy persuaded the Raja Ampat government to sign a shark and manta ray sanctuary (that had been declared in 2010) into law. The law protects sharks and rays in 46,000 square kilometers (18,000 square miles) of ocean off the coast of Raja Ampat. And for the past three years, CORAL’s Indonesian field team has been gathering community input—from fishermen, business operators, and government officials—on plans for a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) off the coast of Bali. Born in Bandung, West Java, Nan has been a field manager for CORAL since 2009. She always loved nature, spending lots of time in “mud, a river, and a little forest” near her home. In college, biology was one of her easiest subjects. But it was her father’s observation—that Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world with 17,500 islands but limited human resources to manage them—that nudged her in the direction of coral reefs and marine biology. After finishing postgraduate work at Bandung Institute of Technology and the School of Environmental Science at the University of East Anglia in the UK, Nan worked for the World Wildlife Fund and Reef Check Foundation, two organizations with which she continues to work closely. She finds that CORAL’s smaller size gives her more of an opportunity to build trust with local communities. Her effectiveness is grounded in her sense of urgency. “We are borrowing time. The need to manage our resources more effectively is escalating,” says Nan. “The only way to do that is for the locals to be the main actors in initiating, developing, implementing, and maintaining conservation systems. To be able to facilitate and empower them to do so is very satisfying.”"

With representatives from 11 countries in the Pacific and over 60 participants and observers, significant progress was made toward ensuring these newly listed species–oceanic whitetip, scalloped hammerhead, great hammerhead, smooth hammerhead, the porbeagle shark, and two species of manta rays–achieve the protection they desperately need. The workshop kicked off in traditional Fijian fashion with an opening welcome from Mr. Samuela Namosimaluaa, Permanent Secretary for Local Government, Urban Development, Housing and Environment, as well as with a video message from the CITES Secretary General Mr. John Scanlon. The panel included Imogen Zethoven, Director of Global Shark Conservation for The Pew Charitable Trusts acting as Chair of the meeting; Mr. Aisake Batibasaga, Principal Fisheries Officer for Fiji; Colin Simfendorfer Director of the IUCN Shark Specialist Group; Shaneen Coulson, CITES Scientific Authority of Australia; and Hugh Robertson, CITES Scientific Authority of New Zealand. Speakers also included Stan Shea—an expert in the shark fin trade in Hong Kong, Ian Freeman from the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), and Lindsay Chapman from Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). All of these speakers assisted in familiarizing participants with the context of these new listings and on the details of how to ensure they are implemented properly. But one presentation stole the show (and the fresh air from the room). Dr. Demian Chapman, aka the ‘”fin Doctor,” as he was aptly nicknamed after his demonstration, ensured that all attendees were familiar with how to identify the fins of these species. His hands-on approach involved displaying dried fins on all of the tables around the room, providing a very fragrant and visual reference. Overall, the two-day workshop was filled with thoughtful questions and productive strategic planning. But most importantly, this meeting gave all of the CITES parties in the region the opportunity to convene and discuss what needs to be done regionally in order for the new listings to be effective. Some key conclusions that spanned the region were: These conclusions will ideally translate into action on the ground, including a plan to address gaps in data, as well as a strategy for enforcement to be put in place prior to the September 14, 2014 implementation date. CORAL looks forward to working with our partners in Fiji to ensure that the government is equipped and prepared to make the most of these landmark listings—which have the potential to significantly reduce shark mortality not only in the Pacific but around the world."

Close to 800 elkhorn corals ( ), listed as critically endangered on the IUCN’s Red List and threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, live in the Bay while the Capiro Banks reef has almost four times more live coral cover than most reefs in the region. When the area was first surveyed and described in 2011, the partnership also measured an uncommonly high density of the long-spined sea urchin, which has seriously declined throughout the Caribbean, on the reef. The designation came about through extensive collaboration and partnerships, work that was generously supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Oak Foundation. “The Mayor of Tela has shown a tremendous amount of leadership in this effort, supported by CORAL and the other groups on the ground,” said Jason Babbie, who works on environment programs at Bloomberg Philanthropies. “I am impressed by how quickly this designation came together for this ecologically important site.”  ###"

At age 13, Dylan founded his own nonprofit called ReefQuest to foster marine stewardship through citizen science. But the idea for ReefQuest—and his first “initiative,” as he puts it—began when he was only seven. Visiting Kahekili Beach Park in Maui with his family, he saw tourists stepping on coral reefs and then complaining that the coral was hurting their feet. Dylan began walking up and down the beach, doing regular “beach patrols,” explaining to his fellow beachgoers that the reef was alive—and that in fact, it was people who were hurting the reef by stepping on it. Their reactions, he says, were varied, but most were appreciative and inspired by a kid wanting to save reefs for future generations. “I made an emotional connection with them,” he says. CORAL awarded ReefQuest its first mini-grant, and has worked with Dylan since 2010. In March, CORAL Field Manager Liz Foote dived the reef with Dylan in Kahekili to take a series of overlapping underwater images, which will be “stitched together” as part of ReefQuest’s “virtual reef.” The virtual reef project is a way for people who can’t—or don’t want to—get wet by taking a “virtual dive” to experience the reef. But it’s also a way to monitor the health of a reef over time, says Dylan. He will be returning to the reef every other year to study it. Dylan plans to continue his life’s work throughout high school, and beyond. One of the most important things he’s learned so far is that people “assume that kids can’t do anything”—but he’s found just the opposite. “I am making a difference—kids really can do something. People say we can’t stop global warming, but there are local threats that are equally as destructive. We can change those things for the better and help these silent ecosystems.”"

The reef continues to be used by the local community and visitors to Kauai for subsistance fishing, gathering of “wana” or sea urchin, cultural practices, snorkeling, surfing, and swimming. But today the reef’s ability to continue to sustainably provide is being challenged. Fish numbers are declining, and a coral disease has recently been documented in the region. To help inform possible solutions, CORAL is teaming up with the Hanalei Watershed Hui (HWH) to gather data on water quality that might yield clues as to the causes of these symptoms. “Despite the importance of the area, very little has been done to examine the water quality of Makua,”says Makaala Kaaumoana, Executive Director of HWH. She and her team will be working with CORAL and local volunteers over the next year to conduct periodic sampling and to analyze data from several sites along the Makua coastline. “The data will be collected by trained area residents, analyzed, and shared with the community as well as government agencies and scientists, so it really is a grassroots, community-led endeavor,” says Makaala. Says CORAL’s Hawai‘i Field Manager Wes Crile (profiled  ), “Once we know what the causes of the declines are, we’ll know where to direct our efforts.” He adds that the Hanalei Watershed Hui is a perfect match and a strong partner for CORAL. “Both CORAL and HWH have at their core the principle of working with communities to solve these complex problems, and HWH has very close ties with the local people.” The reef at Makua has provided for people for so long it is only fitting that people now do something to help the reef, says Wes.

Since joining CORAL as a Hawai‘i field manager in January, he has been busy getting to know his new watershed in Maui. Because Maui is an island, he says, some of its water quality problems are more obvious than in a watershed like Chesapeake Bay, where he worked previously. “On Maui, a simple trip to the store can easily take me through 10 to 15 separate watersheds. You can really see the direct impacts (both positive and negative) that our actions on the land are having on the sea and the reefs.” In addition to restoring streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Wes has worked with communities in northern Nicaragua to protect endangered sea turtles and build sustainable tourism partnerships, with small-scale farmers in West Africa and Haiti, and fishing communities in Latin America and the Caribbean, among others. He is building on those experiences at CORAL. “Whether I’m engaging with farmers, neighborhood associations, or marine tourism providers, I’m getting a chance to work across all of my skills,” he says. A certified dive master and licensed Coast Guard caption, Wes is getting his feet (and body) wet in Ridge to Reef activities, engaging with a variety of groups throughout the watershed. He’s working with fellow Field Manager Liz Foote to set up a floating workshop for decision makers (scheduled for this summer) and helping conduct snorkel tours for local government officials and other stakeholders to show them firsthand the difference between healthy and unhealthy reefs. His favorite part of the job—as it was in his previous work—is collaborating to find solutions to problems. “A scientist tells me we need to reduce polluted runoff, but what I get excited about is how to do that,” he says. “I like finding creative solutions to issues and working with business owners, community members, and others to find solutions that make sense for both the environment and the needs of people. I like explaining sustainability to a general manager at a hotel or resort and really seeing him or her get it.” Although as an avid diver he loves coral reefs, Wes says he’s motivated more by water—where it goes and how clean it is. “It’s what ties the whole community together. It falls on a mountain, flows through different land uses, like agriculture, forests, people’s backyards: As it exits into the ocean, does it leave in a better or worse state? Can we get it to leave in a better state? So many coral reef issues start farther upstream.” He says some solutions to addressing polluted runoff and poor water quality downstream are very simple. “Solutions don’t have to be complicated and expensive or high tech. They can be implemented on a small scale but make a big difference. The rain gardens and other low-impact development options we and our partners at the Ridge to Reef Initiative are working to educate people about are one example.” Read more about Wes  ."

Mayor Arakawa was eager to get in the water to dive with CORAL and our partners from the   and the   (“DAR”) to check out the reef. We had invited the Mayor and Rob Parsons, Executive Assistant for Environmental Concerns, to join us to visit priority watershed conservation sites in West Maui—primarily the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (“KHFMA”), designated by the US Coral Reef Task Force as a top priority. We wanted to see the reef firsthand and talk about solutions to the many interconnected threats facing our reefs. As it turns out, our mayor is an avid waterman. He told us that he has dived reefs all over Maui throughout his life, but hadn’t been out diving in over a year and a half. We were thrilled to provide him with the opportunity to get in the water again. But first we wanted to give him a brief overview of our collaborative efforts. I described CORAL’s work with resorts to promote reef stewardship and improve water quality, and the purpose of these snorkel tours (we’ll have more soon—stay tuned!), and our collaborative efforts with DAR, the Ridge to Reef Initiative, and the   program, which we co-coordinate with DAR. Tova Callender from the Ridge to Reef Initiative described the Initiative’s efforts to reduce land-based pollution by installing rain gardens and curb-inlet baskets, which capture and help filter urban pollutants and debris that find their way into storm drains, and ultimately the ocean. The mayor helped troubleshoot some issues with the curb-inlet baskets. We were encouraged by his eagerness to offer expertise and solutions, and his advocacy for ahupua‘a-based (watershed-based) management and conservation strategies. Darla White, from DAR, discussed fisheries management strategies in West Maui, particularly the establishment and importance of the KHFMA. She also introduced the concept of reef resilience, then gave an overview of what to expect on the snorkel tour. And last but not least, our volunteer team from Ka’anapali Makai Watch talked about their experiences and observations within the KHFMA and their ongoing efforts to help get the word out to residents and visitors about this special place. In the water, both the mayor and Rob displayed impressive skills as freedivers, and we were able to look closely at the “points of interest” Darla had discussed  earlier. She pointed to things underwater and then we all surfaced to hear her describe them in more detail. She showed us several “dead zones,” where once-thriving finger coral is now a collection of low-lying brown rubble; we also made our way to the “bone yard,” where we could still see the three-dimensional structure of coral that had died recently—a haunting and sad reminder of the reef that once thrived there.   We also visited and swam through submarine seeps in shallow water just offshore that were visibly emitting fresh water (which researchers have determined consists primarily of treated wastewater effluent) as well as gas bubbles (determined to be nitrogen gas). While much of the tour highlighted stressed and degraded coral–and the reasons for that condition–we also saw relatively healthy coral colonies, a honu (green sea turtle), and positive signs of potential recovery, including some adult   and a grazing school of about 100 surgeonfishes. After the reef tour, we convened back at the pavilion to enjoy some refreshments, at which time the mayor and Rob took the   to share their commitment to take action to reduce land-based pollution on an individual basis; we posted their pledges   immediately. To wrap up the day, we headed over to check out the demonstration rain garden at Wahikuli Wayside Park only to find that our newly installed interpretive sign had been vandalized with graffiti. Mayor Arakawa grabbed a towel from his vehicle and cleaned the sign off, while Tova discussed rain gardens as a “BMP” (Best Management Practice) for reducing land-based pollution. Rain gardens use native plants to filter stormwater on its path to the ocean. The trip was a great experience and opportunity for our team, and we appreciate the support of all the people who made it happen. We especially thank the mayor for taking so much time out of his busy schedule to join us. Snorkel gear for the trip was provided by  , and the   helped provide refreshments for the event from CJ’s Deli & Diner—delicious! Mahalo to these local businesses for their support!"

All too often, however, scientific results that could be useful languish on library shelves (or get lost in the cloud) instead. Some researchers make concerted efforts to address real-world questions, but these attempts frequently fail because the researchers do not fully understand what kind of information will be most useful to managers and conservation professionals. If on-the-ground practitioners are consulted, it’s usually at the end of a project when they are asked how they will use a new tool or newly revealed information, at which point the opportunity to guide development of the new tool or the type of information collected has long passed. The Reefs Tomorrow Initiative  (RTI) has taken a different approach to ensure that our research results address the most pressing needs of managers and conservation professionals. Parallel to our scientific pursuits, one of RTI’s core goals is to provide practical information managers and conservation practitioners can use to inform real-world management decisions. In the first year of the program, RTI’s conservation team—lead by Dr. Eleanor Sterling from the Center for Biodiversity & Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History—compiled information on how reef managers perceive threats to and changes on their reefs, as well as what kinds of management opportunities they have. The team collected data through an on-line survey and interviews with over 80 conservation practitioners from around the world. The majority of respondents reported frequent threats at local levels (like overfishing) and global scales (such as bleaching from warming waters), and little recovery. They reported some activities being addressed by local management efforts (fishing, land-use practices), while others at provincial or national levels (coastal development, tourism). While the data from these surveys and interviews is still being analyzed, the early results have been shared with RTI’s science team and will be used to guide our research efforts. By better understanding what kinds of information, and in what form, are most helpful to managers in making decisions, we are able to maximize the chance that our research results will be useful and useable. To further these efforts, we recently identified a cadre of managers from the Pacific who will be working closely with RTI over the coming year. Hailing from Palau, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji, these on-the-ground practitioners have attended workshops and joined in meetings with RTI’s scientists. In their role as conservation advisors, they will help us focus on the research that will be most applicable to the challenges they face. By taking a different approach to making science relevant, RTI is making sure that our science leads to real conservation gains.  "

Since most of our project sites are located on islands, we thought we’d celebrate this holiday with a deeper dive into what makes life on these places so interesting. Isolated from their mainland counterparts, island plants and animals evolve independently. Since no genetic mixing occurs with populations in other places, new species unique to the island form over time. This high rate of speciation, or creation of new species, makes islands important drivers of biodiversity. Islands have higher concentrations of endemic species (animals and plants found nowhere else) than continents, and the proportion of endemics increases with an island’s degree of isolation, size, and topographical diversity (which leads to different habitats). Why is biodiversity important? Madhavi Colton, CORAL’s program director for the Reefs Tomorrow Initiative, says biodiversity makes ecosystems more stable. She offers the example of coral reefs in the Caribbean, which used to have many different species of herbivorous fishes. “Overfishing reduced the abundance and diversity of herbivorous fishes leaving urchins as the only species keeping algae in check,” she explains. “When a disease wiped out the urchins, there were no more herbivores left to take their place and algae overgrew the reefs.” When there is a dip in the abundance of a key type of animal in a diverse ecosystem, the consequences will be “less dire because there are other species that play similar roles to pick up the slack,” says Madhavi.

He wrote about his experience: “It didn’t take long into our first dive before [we] started smiling—reefs that had been covered in algae five years ago were recovering. The big fish—snappers, groupers, and barracuda, and morays—were still there, but the smaller fish and little critters (shrimp, nudibranches, etc.) were there in much larger numbers than before, and the hard corals showed ample new growth.” After reading about CORAL’s work in Honduras in our 2013 annual report, Don emailed us to say that he was pleasantly surprised by the condition of the reefs on his 2013 visit—and wondered if CORAL had a hand in making those changes. We’re delighted to say yes. CORAL has been involved in Roatan since 2005, strengthening local groups and building alliances, and working from many different angles to solve environmental problems affecting Honduras’s reefs. This work has included helping the Roatan Marine Park improve their patrols, increase their technical capabilities, and build their financial stability.  CORAL also partners with the Healthy Reefs Initiative to monitor the reefs all around the north coast and Bay Islands. Says Honduras Field Manager Jenny Myton, “The areas where Don was diving have been monitored since 2006 and we have been able to document their improvement. The patrols have been working! The fish are coming back! This is important as some of these fish, especially the parrotfish, control the macroalgae that grow on the reef.” CORAL is also working with the government and local partners to improve regulation of development and to find solutions to the wastewater problems affecting the reef.

Indonesia recently declared three million square kilometers of its seas as a manta sanctuary. “The key for managing highly migratory species is to assure that we protect them not only in [specific] sites, but also along their migratory routes,” says Nan. She adds that to truly protect biodiversity, we also need to protect connections between islands—including coral reefs—to make sure corals can regenerate and replenish themselves after events like mass bleachings. Agus Darmawan, Director of Conservation for Areas and Fish Species at the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, points out that along with protecting mantas comes the responsibility of helping communities whose livelihoods are impacted by conservation regulations. CORAL and our partners are collaborating with national and local governments to help socialize new CITES regulations that regulate trade of some species of mantas and sharks. We have begun working with the community in Lamakera village, arguably the biggest artisanal manta fishery in the world.

        "content": "May 31, 2014 —For some local and state leaders, Saturday began with a special tour of West Maui’s most precious natural and economic resource—our coral reefs. Participants—a “who’s who” from within area government, hotel management, and other sectors critical to Hawai‘i’s future—donned their snorkel gear to explore both healthy and stressed reefs at Olowalu and within the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (KHFMA), and learned how businesses, nonprofits, and agencies are coming together to protect these vital ecosystems. Hosted by Trilogy Excursions, and coordinated by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative, and the Division of Aquatic Resources, the half-day charter aimed to educate decision-makers about the values of and threats to reefs, and to engage them in developing ideas for continued and enhanced collaboration. When not underwater, participants learned about reef ecology, cycled through learning stations on some of the more technical aspects of conservation and management, and even checked out a virtual reef—a three-dimensional online reef developed by ReefQuest.org and its 15-year old founder, Dylan Vecchione. “This was an invaluable opportunity for those who make decisions affecting our natural resources every day to join us on and in the water to see what’s happening to our reefs firsthand. Most importantly, the platform provided a chance to explore solutions together in a fun and informal setting and learn from each other’s expertise and experience,” says CORAL’s Hawai‘i Field Manager Liz Foote. Elle Cochran, Maui County Councilmember for West Maui, shares that perspective. Cochran was impressed by the turnout of government representatives and other community leaders with diverse backgrounds, noting “I’ve never seen that happen before—such a wonderful meeting of the minds where we have all gathered together to learn about our reefs and share solutions.” She added, “how many of our decision makers literally get into the ocean to see our reefs with their own eyes? This was an amazing opportunity and I know it makes a difference for me personally to engage in conservation solutions after having this firsthand perspective to see the impacts of our activities, rather than just viewing photos or presentations.” State and federal agencies have identified two watersheds within West Maui as priority areas for reef stewardship. The KHFMA is within one of those watersheds, and represents a new and crucial strategy for protecting reefs: protect the herbivorous fish that feed on potentially harmful algae. These priority areas are being managed through a multi-partner effort—the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative—that incorporates holistic resource management at the watershed level. Opportunities like this tour that can inform, inspire and engage local leaders only strengthen efforts currently underway—and provide much hope for Hawai‘i’s coral reefs.  ###"

Through their feeding habits and behaviors, sea turtles have developed a remarkable symbiotic relationship with coral reefs. Let’s explore the fascinating interdependence between sea turtles and coral reefs, as well as the importance of preserving this delicate balance. Sea turtles, particularly green turtles and hawksbills, rely on seagrass beds as a primary food source. As these herbivorous creatures graze on seagrass,  , hindering the necessary process of photosynthesis that corals need to survive. By maintaining the balance of seagrass beds, sea turtles indirectly contribute to the health of nearby coral reefs. Our turtle friends also play a vital role in controlling algae growth on coral reefs. As they feed on seagrass, they inadvertently  . The presence of sea turtles helps keep algae levels in check, ensuring corals receive sufficient light for photosynthesis. These underwater gardeners serve as essential nutrient cyclers between coral reefs and seagrass beds. Turtles digest the plant matter and excrete nutrient-rich waste.

        "content": "Coral reefs, the vibrant and diverse underwater ecosystems, are not only breathtakingly beautiful but also vital for the health of our oceans. These magnificent structures teem with life, providing habitats for countless marine species. However, their survival is intrinsically tied to one crucial factor: water quality.  Let’s explore the dynamic connection between water quality and coral reefs, and why preserving pristine conditions is essential for their well-being. Just like terrestrial organisms, corals need oxygen to survive. Adequate oxygen levels in the surrounding water are vital for coral respiration and the metabolic activities of other reef dwellers. Pollution and excessive nutrient enrichment can deplete oxygen levels, leading to hypoxia, a condition that stresses and can even kill corals. Maintaining good water quality ensures the oxygen-rich environment that corals depend on. Coral reefs thrive within specific temperature ranges, but climate change poses a significant threat. Poor water quality exacerbates this issue by contributing to elevated water temperatures. When exposed to stressors like warm water, corals undergo bleaching—a process where they expel their symbiotic algae, leaving them vulnerable. This not only weakens their resilience but also affects the entire reef ecosystem. Preserving water quality aids in mitigating temperature fluctuations and protecting corals from the detrimental effects of bleaching. Coral reefs exist in a delicate balance of nutrients. However, human activities can disrupt this harmony. Excessive nutrient inputs from sources like agricultural runoff and sewage discharge cause eutrophication—a condition where nutrient levels become unnaturally high. This leads to rapid algal growth, smothering corals and hindering their access to sunlight and nutrients. Furthermore, algal overgrowth impedes oxygen exchange, jeopardizing the reef’s health. Maintaining water quality helps preserve the nutrient balance vital to coral reef ecosystems. Sedimentation poses another threat to coral reefs. Poor water quality contributes to increased sediment loads, resulting in the deposition of sediments on reefs. This sedimentation blocks sunlight, suffocates corals, and disrupts their feeding, growth, and reproductive processes. It also hampers the settlement of coral larvae, making it challenging for new corals to establish and thrive. By addressing water quality issues, we can prevent sedimentation and safeguard the future of coral reefs. Chemical pollutants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and oil spills, pose a severe risk to coral reefs. These contaminants enter the water and wreak havoc on corals, inhibiting their growth, reproduction, and overall health. Moreover, they disturb the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem, impacting the diverse array of organisms that rely on the reef for survival. Preserving water quality is essential for reducing pollution and protecting corals from the toxic threats they face. Water quality is an indispensable factor in the preservation and prosperity of coral reefs. By understanding the intricate connection between water quality and reef health, we can take proactive steps to ensure their survival. Mitigating pollution, controlling nutrient runoff, and addressing climate change are all critical actions that can help protect these remarkable ecosystems. Let us work together to preserve the vibrant beauty and ecological significance of coral reefs for generations to come."

        "content": "Here at CORAL, summer travel is in full swing. During recent weeks, our staff from around the world have amplified CORAL’s mission to save coral reefs by taking part in various conservation events. We believe it’s vital to collaborate with organizations and leaders in science and conservation to enhance our work, share knowledge, and ultimately take effective actions to protect the world’s coral reefs.  Check out where we’ve made a splash, with the latest news from our staff: During the week of June 27, senior staff Jenny Myton and Mandy Norman represented CORAL at the  in Lisbon, Portugal. The event was an opportunity for policy leaders to set pledges, as well as for NGOs and conservationists to present and learn from one another.  CORAL stood alongside the  , as members presented on the impact of water pollution and the need for effective sewage management models. Meanwhile, both Myton and Norman engaged with foundations and oversea development agencies to expand upon our work.  “In addition to collaboration opportunities, one of my highlights was hearing from Sylvia Earle. She is an accomplished oceanographer and Ted Prize winner,” says Myton. “We left feeling so inspired by her words and urgent call to action.” Concluding the week, various   to expand upon Marine Protected Areas in order to reduce pollution, loss of biodiversity, overfishing, and other ocean threats. “If these pledges are implemented and maintained, they will help improve conditions for coral reefs and ultimately protect more than a million marine species,” says Myton. Not long after the UN Ocean Conference, Dr. Helen Fox and Dr. Andrea Rivera-Sosa from CORAL’s Global Science Conservation team made their way to Germany for the  . The event was an opportunity for coral reef scientists and marine managers to come together and share new innovations, data, and research.  Fox and Rivera-Sosa presented updates on their research, and also led a workshop along with counterpart Brianna Bambic on the , the world’s first comprehensive map of shallow water coral reefs, and its bleaching monitoring tool. They also met with other coral scientists and conservation leaders, both during formal sessions and outside of the conference. “It was so great to finally connect with other scientists in person again,” says Rivera-Sosa. “I had the chance to get the word out about the  , as well as learn about new research and science.”   Next, we traveled within Hawai‘i for the   Roughly 200 water and wastewater professionals attended and both Jennifer Vander Veur and Erica Perez, Hawai‘i’s senior program managers, gave presentations about our work in Maui and Hawai‘i Island. Vander Veur and Perez demonstrated the repercussions of poor water quality as a result of land-based pollution. Sedimentation and wastewater pollution are negatively impacting  Hawai‘i’s coral reef ecosystems, and CORAL is leading initiatives that tackle the problem. Vander Veur focused on watershed management and detailed ways sediment runoff is impacting our downstream water resources, while Perez led a workshop on  Hawai‘i’s transition away from cesspools, which everyday discharge roughly 53 million gallons of raw sewage into groundwater and nearshore systems across the state.  By attending this technical conference, our field staff gathered valuable insights from industry professionals which can better inform Hawai‘i’s state working groups and ultimately implement effective water and sanitation solutions across the state.  To top off CORAL’s summer travel, Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast in Honduras, was accepted into the prestigious   to represent Honduras in the program “Resilience, Protection and Environmental Conservation.” He recently traveled to multiple cities across the U.S. for this three-week exchange. Joined by professionals across Latin America, San Martin Chicas participated in programs that pertained to U.S. policies and made meaningful connections that will improve and build upon local conservation initiatives in Honduras.  “I am so proud of Julio and how far he’s come as both a professional and representative for CORAL,” says Dr. Antonella Rivera, who named for San Martin Chicas the program. “This was a very competitive program, which our field team in Honduras nominated him for.”  Without a doubt, it’s been an impactful summer. We are thrilled to travel again and have the opportunity to share our message with new audiences, collaborate with like-minded groups, and take meaningful steps toward saving the world’s coral reefs. "

        "content": "Like the birds and the bees, corals also need to reproduce and continue to build upon the colorful reefs that we know and love. But have you ever wondered the coral animal reproduces? After all, it can’t move and it doesn’t have any reproductive organs.  Let’s take a look at exactly how new coral babies come about and important ways we have and will continue to protect them. Something unique about corals is the fact that different species can reproduce in different ways: by spawning, self fertilization, or asexual reproduction.  When the conditions and moon cycle are just right, an incredible phenomenon called   occurs. Over a period of days or weeks, a variety of coral species will simultaneously release their male and female reproductive cells, known as gametes, into the water. The gametes merge together, fertilize, and form coral larvae, which then float with the current for up to several weeks before eventually finding a hard surface to attach to. This form of reproduction allows for genetic diversity and it gives healthy coral babies the chance to repopulate nearby reefs. In addition to spawning events, some species have the ability to produce larvae internally and then release larvae into the water once they are more developed and have a better chance of settling. This general form of reproduction is known as “brooding.” Lastly, some corals are able to reproduce asexually—which is unique for marine invertebrates. Using different strategies, the coral animal is able to either clone itself or reattach to a new hard surface. This form of coral reproduction is useful during storms or adverse weather events, because it allows broken pieces of coral to form new colonies and continue to live and grow. During coral spawning, there is a high probability that the coral baby will not survive. Marine animals, such as whale sharks, often snack on floating coral gametes and larvae. And even when the babies do attach to a hard surface, they may not survive if the ocean conditions are poor. Poor conditions include excessive algae growth, which is often due to overfishing and a lack of herbivorous fish on a reef, or high levels of bacteria in the water from wastewater pollution.  Furthermore, when severe coral bleaching occurs, it impacts a reef’s likelihood of spawning at all. “It takes a lot of energy for corals to reproduce,” says Dr. Andrea Rivera-Sosa, CORAL’s project and outreach manager. “If a coral is not healthy, it likely will not spawn at that time; however, if the coral recovers, research shows it will be able to reproduce again.”  In order to protect both spawning corals and new babies, it is vital that we improve ocean conditions by lowering our carbon footprint and reducing human impacts. That’s why we focus on minimizing marine threats by working with local communities and partners.  Ongoing donations and support have allowed us to expand marine protected areas,  ,  ,  , and more. Additionally, we are able to fund the work of partners on the ground, like  , who regularly conduct research and monitoring during mass spawning events. “The management of our coral reefs is critical to the preservation of our marine ecosystems and livelihoods,” says Damaris Duenas, research coordinator at RMP, who leads spawning monitoring initiatives. “Learning more about their [corals’] lives allows us to better assist them.” Together, with the hand work of local partners and generous support from individuals and organizations worldwide, we are taking actions and advancing research to keep coral reefs healthy and able to successfully reproduce for future generations. "

        "content": "Did you know there’s a fish tank that produces tasty vegetables, can create economic opportunities, and helps protect coral reefs? It’s called an aquaponics system, and it combines aquaculture and hydroponics to raise fish and grow organic fruits and vegetables.  An aquaponics system relies on a symbiotic relationship between fish and plants. Fish waste fertilizes the growing plants and in return, the plants filter and clean the water for the fish.  , and in the last year we’ve created the conditions for both native fish and plants to thrive and investigated new ways this system could support the local community. In Tela Bay, Honduras, Los Micos Lagoon suffers from overfishing, which impacts the health of nearby coral reefs and the quality of fish caught by local fishers. Over the last year, we’ve been testing to see if aquaponics could promote food and income security for these coastal communities, which rely so heavily on fishing. Cultivating aquaponics systems within the community has the potential to reduce fishing pressure in the lagoon and allow marine environments to rest and recuperate. Native fish from the system can also be released into the lagoon, which could help restock dwindling populations.  This year, Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras, has monitored Tela’s first aquaponics system and is researching what it can successfully produce. By 2023, he will start educating the community and working with local fishers who are interested in creating their own aquaponics system.  An aquaponics system has the potential to grow a wide range of plants—like tomatoes, hot peppers, strawberries, leafy greens, among others. But for the best results, San Martin Chicas focuses on growing produce that can survive naturally in the region, without any chemicals. “We don’t use chemicals or pesticides as this could harm the fish, tamper with the water quality, and impact human health,” says San Martin Chicas. “It is safer to focus solely on organic fruits and vegetables.”  Recently, he started growing hot yellow peppers, known locally as “chile cabro.” The pepper can be eaten whole, in salads, or blended into a spicy salsa or hot sauce. San Martin Chicas thinks these new products might sell in local markets—and it is just one of many potential products and ideas that could come from an aquaponics system. Ultimately, we plan to replicate our aquaponics system to create a larger impact across Tela and in other coastal communities in Honduras. By reducing fishing pressure along Mesoamerican Reef, which is the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, we are able to minimize algae growth, increase fish biomass, and keep coral reefs healthy.  Thanks to generous support, CORAL has seen great success in Tela’s first aquaponics system in 2022 and we are looking forward to collaborating with local fishers in the upcoming year to expand the project and amplify its impact. "

        "content": "As part of CORAL’s development team, I don’t get many opportunities to go into the field. But last month, I joined Field Programs Director Jason Vasques on a trip to Playa del Carmen, Mexico, for a series of meetings relating to our work with the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI). Now, not only are trips into the field a little rarer for us development folk, but I didn’t join CORAL with much of a conservation or marine biology background. When I joined CORAL in the summer of 2009, my only interaction with a reef was snorkeling in Bermuda when I was seven. Had I not taken this job, I am not sure I would have ever pursued SCUBA certification. Having said that, w  . In the winter of 2011, when my first work trip to our project site in Mexico was approaching, I gave more serious thought to the idea of getting certified. Not wanting to miss out on an opportunity to see firsthand what it is that I spend my days fundraising for, I signed up for a four-day open water certification course with a local Bay Area dive shop. Fast forward three years later, and as I am on the boat heading out to our dive site in Cozumel, I am reminded of a conversation we have had many times back at HQ: the topic of shifting baselines. As a novice diver, it isn’t uncommon for people like me to jump in the water and be amazed by the beauty and tranquility of a coral reef. The marine life and complex structures are breathtaking to see up close. With only a handful of dives under my belt, I am like a child visiting Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory: “this is in-cred-i-ble,” I think to myself. Had I gone diving 30 years ago (an impossibility given my age, but stick with me here) and then gone again today, my reaction might be more despairing and sad. Of course, having worked with CORAL for five years, I know intellectually that these reefs I am seeing are not as healthy as they could or should be—but they are still a wonder to me. Back on the boat, I ask Jason what the coral cover is; his response is a solemn, “Oh, this particular dive site…barely 6-10%.” Without the knowledge I have gained during my tenure at CORAL, I might have gone through that dive thinking , without giving much thought to what a reef   and   represent. This is a shifting baseline at work. My reference point is different to those who explored those Cozumel reefs back in the 80s and 90s. But does that mean I shouldn’t be concerned? Not at all. Is the situation dire? Yes. Is it impossible to beat? Absolutely not. I am inspired by stories of reefs in recovery or report cards that show improvements in reef health. I am inspired by that 6-10% of coral cover fighting for the chance to survive—and thrive. And I am inspired by the dozens of people I have had the privilege to meet who are working tirelessly to leverage tourism to protect our planet’s precious coral reefs. What about you? What are you most inspired by and hopeful for when it comes to the future of reefs?"

How will they enforce regulations? The new reserve is going to be six times its current size—it will span across 383,000 acres. And it holds some of the most pristine and healthy coral reef ecosystems in the world. Its isolation and remoteness make it a vital area for understanding how healthy coral reefs function and adapt to global changes. Our   has been leading these research efforts on Palmyra Atoll, located within the PRINMM, to help steer conservation efforts on reef systems elsewhere in the world. The area is also an  —a species in dire need of better protection. According to the Center for American Progress, a single bluefin can be sold for more than $20,000, and there is an incredibly popular, lucrative, and under-regulated market for them in Japan. The Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument was created by   in January of 2009 by President Bush. The Proclamation states that “the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall not allow or permit any appropriation, injury, destruction, or removal of any feature of this monument except as provided for by this proclamation and shall prohibit commercial fishing within boundaries of the monument.” That being said,   found that although the Proclamation prohibited fishing by U.S. vessels in the area, there are no enforceable regulations to prevent such activities, and that penalties are too low to deter illegal fishing. Further, the study found that the U.S. Coast Guard, NOAA, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife are too underfunded and underequipped to manage the area effectively, and lack the collaboration and cooperation necessary between co-enforcers to be effective. And that was before the expansion. Unfortunately, despite these challenges,   to expand the reserve states that “nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument as specified in Proclamation 8336.” While the expansion of the Marine National Monument is a great step forward in protecting our oceans, I sincerely hope more resources are dedicated to the effort to prevent this area from being only a “paper park.” The work is just beginning, so let’s keep heading in the right direction!"

That’s why we hosted a meeting on October 27 that brought together more than 13 organizations from Honduras. The day had one goal: to build alliances between a host of organizations that are all working toward the same outcome—a healthy and thriving coastal and marine environment in Honduras. Rather than a formal agenda, each group presented about their work for 10 minutes, and then led a question and answer session that often turned into lively and stimulating conversations where everyone shared their ideas, their frustrations, what works, and what doesn’t. The meeting was purposefully left rather unstructured to allow for relationships to organically form. And it certainly worked. The group has already had a follow-up meeting, and is collaborating to secure a higher level of involvement and support of marine conservation efforts from the Honduran government. This meeting preceded a larger workshop hosted by the  , a CORAL partner in the Mesoamerican region, which brought together over 60 groups from Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. The 3-day HRI workshop served to launch a new public database for the MAR that empowers local managers to understand the overall status and trends of their marine environment and make educated conservation decisions. HRI also presented preliminary data that will be included in their 2015 Report Card to be released early next year. We can’t protect coral reefs alone. Conservation is a global effort, and requires diverse groups coming together to work toward common goals. We’re honored to have incredible NGO partners, like those in Honduras with whom we gathered last week, who are willing to collaborate with us to protect one of our planet’s most precious ecosystems."

The room was full of people who care deeply about the health of our oceans. When I would tell people I was the Lead Conservation Scientist at CORAL, they were all very eager to know more. They were aware of the challenges facing coral reefs and interested to learn what they could do to help address those challenges. It was great to see first-hand that word is getting out that coral reefs need our help, thanks to places like the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and encouraging to realize just how many people want to be part of the solution. The evening’s speakers all emphasized the need for collective action to protect our oceans. Michael Bloomberg spoke about increasing the effectiveness of marine resource management, and David Packard Award recipient George Shultz spoke about the urgent need for action given the mounting threats of global climate change. As I looked around at the passionate attendees, I felt a sense of comradery and hope. There are so many of us working to support ocean conservation, including the amazing teams at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and at CORAL.

I chose CORAL because I have always been interested in the ocean, especially as a child, and I thought learning about coral reefs would be especially intriguing since I previously didn’t have much knowledge about them. This semester, I’ve been researching CORAL’s microgrant program. I first compiled all of the archived information that existed on the microgrants they’ve handed out and sorted them by location. I then analyzed the data and wrote up a final report showing which categories of microgrants received the most grant money and how that money was used. Since 1995, CORAL has given out 96 microgrants to 17 different countries. The total amount of money given out by CORAL is $589,724.07. The two countries that have received the highest number of microgrants were the United States and Honduras. In the United States, 21 of the 22 microgrants were given to support projects in Hawai‘i (Figure 1). The microgrants were used for four major purposes: education, mooring buoys, equipment, and awareness. Education has been the most popular category, with 38 microgrants totaling $157,772.95.  Mooring buoys were the second largest category for microgrants. Mooring buoys are a necessary tool used to mark boundaries of marine protected areas and to anchor boats so that coral reefs are not destroyed. CORAL gave $140,837.60 to 22 mooring buoys projects, which funded 300 new buoys, along with additional training or maintenance. Sixteen projects were related to purchasing new equipment, including boat engines, monitoring tools, and cameras that help reduce poaching and catch rule breakers. These tools help protect coral reefs by ensuring marine protected areas are effectively managed and regulations are enforced. The total amount CORAL gave to equipment microgrants was $74,454.82. CORAL gave out $43,200.84 to projects that promoted general outreach and awareness, such as advertisements, new signs, and photographic displays. These more general outreach techniques serve to educate a broader public and visitors about the benefits of protecting coral reefs, and build support for ongoing conservation efforts. The remaining microgrants served various purposes, such as setting up new marine protected areas or the general continuation of the conservation of coral reefs. Figure 2 illustrates the percentages of the total money given out by CORAL to each category. I believe that microgrants can be very useful. Smaller groups or organizations might not get the chance to protect coral reefs without additional funding, and microgrants allow CORAL to work and build support for coral conservation efforts in various countries around the world. I learned that microgrants can be applied to many different categories as opposed to focusing on only a few projects, and I think that makes them beneficial as a way to help coral reefs. Since the microgrant applications are initiated by locals, we get additional insight to what is going on directly with coral reefs in countries around the world. CORAL staff plan to add to the information I compiled to learn more about some of the long term impacts these microgrants have had. But it’s not hard to see that many of CORAL’s successes today are built on successful microgrant investments of the past. What do you think of microgrants as a conservation strategy?

He recently quit his job as villa caretaker and fisherman to focus full-time on developing a sustainable dive tourism industry in his hometown of Bondalem in Bali. This will generate support for his community’s marine protected area, as well as provide alternative livelihoods for fishermen to reduce the amount of fishing pressure on the reef. In December, Nyoman and his partners from the community surveillance group he used to work at invited the rest of the Bondalem community to attend a meeting to discuss the potential for tourism in the area. Our Coral Triangle Regional Field Manager Naneng Setiasih was a guest speaker at the meeting, and was able to highlight Nyoman’s prize, recognition which excited the entire community. Nyoman has also been using his prize money to install more fish aggregation devices (FADs), designed to attract more pelagic fish and take the fishing pressure off of nearshore reef fish. This will help compensate the fishermen affected by the no-take zone that was created with the marine protected area. At CORAL’s 20  anniversary gala in September, the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for the Republic of Indonesia announced that the Buleleng Regency (where Bondalem is located) will hold a Dive Bali Buleleng Festival in 2015.

So for those of us in our headquarters office in Oakland, California, it’s always a treat when we get to travel to our field sites and see the reefs we work so hard to save. I recently had a chance to travel to Hawai‘i with a few others from headquarters and meet with our field team there. Much of our week-long visit was focused around a single question: what do we need to do in the next five years in order to save coral reefs in Hawai‘i? On the surface, it sounds simple enough. We know that coastal pollution is a primary threat to reefs in Hawai‘i. So as long as we can reduce the amount of runoff entering the marine environment, we should be good, right? It’s once we actually started delving in to that answer, and the process and needs started to unravel, that I realized just how complicated the situation actually is. For starters, the pollution that’s entering the marine environment in Hawai‘i is coming in different forms, from different sources. It’s wastewater coming from injection wells and cesspools, stormwater runoff coming from landscapes, and sediment runoff coming from fallow agriculture land and construction sites. Which means there are multiple stakeholder groups with a variety of interests, complex social structures, and embedded organizational and political systems that all need to be involved in protecting coral reefs. So our work isn’t as simple as saying we need to address the primary threat to reefs. Instead, our work is about restoring entire social and natural systems. During our strategic planning meetings, the word  came up a lot. Traditionally, the Hawaiian word refers to a slice of land, ranging from the tops of the mountains down to the sea, that follows the natural boundaries of a watershed. But there’s more to it than just the land and the sea—there are also the communities, the businesses, the politics and the social networks included in that word. In order to really save coral reefs, we have to restore entire   to their healthy and functioning natural states—not just from the environmental side, but also from the social side. So what does that mean? It means we have to overcome the emotions and systems that are preventing us as a society from taking action toward restoring the health of the marine environment and in turn, the health of local communities. And in order to do that, we must be able to demonstrate that protecting coral reefs leads to good things. We must be successful in the work that we’re already doing—working with hotels along the Ka‘anapali coastline of Maui to prepare them for using recycled water and adopting LID (Low Impact Design) practices in their landscapes; working with the stakeholders of the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (KHFMA) to protect herbivore populations from overfishing along the Ka‘anapali coastline; working with the Puakō community on Hawai‘i Island to reduce the amount of wastewater entering the marine environment from individual homes; and of course, building partnerships with other organizations, businesses, and individuals who are also working to protect Hawai‘i’s coral reefs. If we can do all of this, and demonstrate that these projects have real life impacts, we have a better chance of motivating others to adopt practices that will help protect coral reefs, one of the unique natural wonders that make Hawai‘i special, for generations to come. One of the highlights of the trip for me (aside from seeing whales breaching off the coast of Maui!), was talking to Duane Sparkman, the Engineering/Landscaping Manager at The Westin Maui Resort & Spa. He’s a real advocate for the environment, and has changed the Westin’s landscape practices to reduce their impact on the near-shore reef. He uses compost instead of chemicals, is building rain gardens and designing the landscape to catch stormwater, and is preparing the hotel to use recycled water on their landscape. By doing so, he’s creating a more sustainable future for the Westin, and setting up systems that will lead to cost savings in the long run. And the landscape looks prettier—the plants are healthier and the grass is greener. Sparkman is the perfect partner and spokesman for what we are trying to accomplish. His landscape is a critical part of the  —it’s the last line of defense, the property closest to the coral reefs. Having his landscape designed to catch sediment and prevent stormwater runoff is a major factor in restoring the health of the watershed. And he’s demonstrated success—by putting coral reefs at the forefront of his decisions and actions, he’s positively impacting the business and he’s enhancing the guest experience. “I just want to do the right thing for the environment,” says Sparkman. “If this reef dies, what did I do? I didn’t do the right thing. The ocean is the jewel. That’s the thing we’re trying to save. It’s not about me.” While I absolutely love Sparkman’s humility and selfless rationale, I have to disagree with his last sentence. Saving the reef is about him, and it’s about me, and it’s about you. Saving the reef means we protect livelihoods and economies. It means we protect our homes, businesses, and hotels from wave action. It means we have healthy, nutritious food to eat. It means we can find the cure to horrible diseases and have necessary medicines. Saving the reef is about keeping us, and our planet, healthy. We have no choice but to keep saving coral reefs, and I’m so glad we have such tremendous partners and supporters to help us do just that."

The impressive coral reefs at Puakō are among the best developed and most diverse in Hawai‘i, making the site an ideal location for coral reef studies. Numerous scientific studies have been conducted at Puakō, because of the unique characteristics, clear waters, and easy access. UH Hilo, UH Manoa, and top universities across the United States use the Puakō reef as a site to conduct research and train students on coral reef science and conservation. The development of the Puakō Marine Center is timely for coral reef science. Coral reefs are in peril around the world, and Puakō has the potential of becoming the best hands-on living laboratory to promote understanding and conservation of one of Earth’s most precious resources. The site would provide the perfect field station for the study of water quality and coral reef conservation and management. With low impact on the area, the facility would serve to spotlight the traditional Hawaiian relationship with the sea and the growing focus on the connections between human communities and their coastal resources and environments. Located on Hawai’i Island and with the only undergraduate Marine Science degree program in the state, UH Hilo plans to develop the Puakō Marine Center to train undergraduate and graduate students, current and future teachers, and native Hawaiians in marine education and provide a base for coastal research. The center would be one of the few field stations in the world dedicated to ocean research activities in which local students are the primary participants. With the academic support of UH Hilo, whose primary mission is to provide excellent undergraduate liberal arts and professional programs, the marine center would provide a wide range of educational and research activities. The Puakō Marine Center, supported by UH Hilo Marine Science Program, will serve statewide marine education and research training needs and provide support for national and international institutions that desire to conduct research activities in Hawaiian coastal and coral reef environments. The facility will build on successful programs and collaborations, such as the Marine Options Program, the QUEST scientific diving program – QUEST, and Marine Science Summer Course Program. Training future marine leaders and developing collaborations will be our measures of success."

Through grants from the Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Aquatics, and the Hawaii Tourism Authority they are accomplishing multiple objectives. The purpose of the grant was ungulate and erosion mitigation and native plant propagation. Some of the methods used to achieve this goal include installing ungulate proof fencing, using great care to preserve and protect the historical trail that runs through the land, and building a sediment dam to prevent flood waters from carrying debris into the ocean. To help with the high erosion runoff, rocks were used to disperse the water from the heavy seasonal rains over a larger area and over 2,000 plants were propagated and grown by KCA residents, and planted with the help of volunteers from all over the island, over a 10 week period of time in erosion prone areas. A sediment dam in the large ravine helped to capture more than a foot of sediment from reaching the ocean during the heavy rains in December alone, thus helping to maintain a healthier ocean and marine environment. Additionally, KCA has partnered with Liquid Robotics Inc. who have outfitted a Wave Glider to collect and analyze water samples to monitor the water quality. Samples were collected in four regions between Honokoa and Kaumaki gulches. Kailapa contracted the UH Analytical Lab to analyze the near shore samples at Kawaihae to gather baseline measurements. This monitoring is on-going so that we can compare data and record changes. Part of the success of KCA is the outreach and educational programs it provides to the residents and communities. Through volunteer workdays, workshops are held to teach and learn about proven propagation, out-planting, and watering techniques specific to dryland plants. Using presentations, photos, brochures, maintaining an active website with updated information on past, present, and upcoming projects with relevant current events; utilizing grant opportunities to advance the cultural, historical, and environmental importance of our Islands to educate within our community; as well as sharing knowledge with all Hawaiian Homestead Associations and surrounding areas, we are making strides which are vital to preserving a healthier ecosystem and environment for the Native Hawaiian Ohanas."

In West Maui, ocean waters were cloudy for several days following the storms, and while surf was big, few surfers wanted to venture into the murky waters. Murky ocean conditions are generally caused by an excess of stormwater flowing down from the mountains, and bringing sediment, and other pollutants with it. We recently published an introductory guide to LID systems for hotel and resort property owners and managers to help address this issue—you can find it for download online. Low Impact Design (LID) can help prevent flooding on land and murky conditions in the sea by filtering stormwater before it reaches the ocean. LID refers to landscape designs that slow, filter, and sink stormwater into the ground where it is naturally filtered by plants and soil and can recharge groundwater. Rain gardens are probably the most well-known type of LID system. Instead of flowing down a storm drain or into the ocean, stormwater from roofs or parking lots is channeled into the garden where plants remove pollutants and sink the water safely into the ground. An example of a rain garden can be seen at   complete with an interpretive sign explaining its function in reducing stormwater runoff. For anyone wanting to build their own rain garden in Maui, see this   published by Hui o Koʻolaupoko. Other examples of LID systems found in the CORAL LID guide include: CORAL recently published an introductory guide to LID systems for hotel and resort property owners and managers entitled: Print copies of the LID guide are available by contacting Wes Crile at   or 808 359-3689.  Wes is also available if you would like technical advice or assistance assessing your property’s potential for implementing an LID system.

        "content": "What’s the price tag of coral reefs? Roughly $11 trillion. From food, medicines, recreation, and tourism to coastline protection from erosion, coral reefs benefit an estimated 1 billion people. Zoom in, and more than 330 million people reside in the immediate vicinity of coral reefs, and their livelihoods often rely on healthy reefs and their related resources. But, coral reefs face a multitude of threats, and unsustainable fishing of certain species that help our reefs is one of them.  While unsustainable fishing practices such as fishing during specific months of the year or in certain critical fish spawning threaten the future of reefs, so does fishing herbivorous fish. Herbivorous fish are ones that eat the seaweeds that would otherwise smother corals. These “lawnmowers of the reefs” include parrotfishes (  in Hawaiian), surgeonfishes (like  ,  , and  ), and chubs ( ), among others. Overfishing herbivores exacerbates the challenges that reefs already face, such as pollution. At CORAL, we recognize this critical link between  (wise) fishing and the health of coral reefs. While it may seem backwards, how fishing is done can actually positively impact coral reef health, and fishers can act as stewards of the ocean when fishing sustainably. But, when anyone takes too many fish, they harm not only their target catch populations but also the delicate coral ecosystem.  In short, fewer herbivores means fewer corals and less reefs, so eventually less fish. Overfishing causes a vicious cycle of reef degradation. So, why is unsustainable fishing happening in Hawaii? CORAL interviewed Dr. Mark Hixon, Endowed Professor of Marine Biology at the University of Hawaii, to learn more about the hurdles facing fishers and healthy reefs on O‘ahu.  Whether it’s fishing for sport or for commercial reasons, the challenges faced by fishers in Hawaii are complex and rooted in a history of slim fisheries management within state waters. Despite existing regulations, their ambiguity and lack of dissemination, education, and enforcement has created a chaotic scenario. When asked about the current situation of fisheries, Dr. Hixon explained that “It’s essentially a free-for-all on O‘ahu, which has led to obvious overexploitation – a classic tragedy of the commons.”  This tricky situation remains in part because when attempts are made to introduce proactive fishing regulations, pushback from a vocal minority within the fishing community often ensues. They advocate for self-regulation, perpetuating the status quo of overfishing and reef decline due to a lack of necessary herbivorous fish biomass Indeed, the movement for sustainable fishing is advocated by local respected elders, or  , within the Hawaiian communities, who are expressing their desire for change. There is hope. CORAL partner,   is deeply committed to educating our society regarding this need for replenishing herbivore populations. Founded by Dr. Hixon and other ocean lovers as an educational outreach campaign to encourage understanding and action for sustainable fishing practices in Hawaii,   is more than a small   (club). According to Dr. Hixon, “it’s a growing   (family) of ocean enthusiasts, scientists, watermen and women, and fishermen who care about our Hawaiian Islands, the culture, and the reefs that surround them.” The core belief of   lies in the power of education. Its mission is to help people understand the critical link between healthy herbivorous fish populations and the health and future of coral reefs.  Instead of dictating rules,   aims to empower individuals to become wise, concerned, and sustainable  fishermen and seafood consumers, fostering a sense of responsibility toward the oceans that surround Hawaii. Dr. Hixon explained that “for generations of Hawaiians,   has been the practice of living in balance, of right action, and of acting wisely and with good purpose,” so the organization’s name speaks for itself. When asked about the primary way that fishers can act with both themselves and the ocean in mind, Dr. Hixon responded that it really boils down to “being concerned, wise, sustainable fishers who understand that it’s the herbivorous fish that keep seaweed under control and therefore keep reefs healthy.”  ’ commitment to ocean conservation echoes through various community initiatives. Through compelling television and radio public service announcements,   spokespersons convey the importance of preserving herbivorous fish alive, rather than depleting their populations. These messages are designed to reach a broad audience, directing them to social media platforms where knowledge is shared and amplified. Additionally,   ambassadors like US National Spearfishing Champion Kimi Werner and the organization’s esteemed local ocean scientists like Dr. Randy Kosaki and Dr. Kawika Winter serve as role models for local youth on O‘ahu. Each of the ambassadors and scientific advisors has their own unique journey and connection to the ocean, underscoring the urgency of the cause and demonstrating that every individual can make a difference. ’ message is clear and resonant: the decline of Hawaii’s reefs is partly due to unsustainable fishing practices, but is also a result of multifaceted challenges, including pollution. “Reef decline is due to more than just unsustainable fishing practices. But, if you want to fix the reefs that have been affected by pollution, then let’s cast fishers as the heroes that can save the reef.” By targeting less obvious species than parrotfishes and surgeonfishes that are critical to reef health, fishers can actually allow the reefs to recover while still enjoying their sport. This will pave the way for a healthier marine ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Hawaii’s reefs face a bleak future. Coral bleaching, seaweed infestation, and the loss of diverse marine life are imminent threats. “Hawaii’s coral reefs are predicted to bleach every single year by 2040, and we’re going to end up with a bunch of dead reefs with a bunch of seaweed if we don’t collectively change our ways. And, once a reef is covered in seaweed, there’s no getting it back without abundant herbivores.” Throughout his research and career, Dr. Hixon has witnessed the gradual decline of herbivorous fish populations in various reefs around the world and the impact it has had on the vitality of the reefs they inhabit. He shared that he lost his favorite reef in the Bahamas that he’d studied for 10 years: “the whole thing died before my very eyes; it was just heartbreaking, gut wrenching.” Because he wants his children and grandchildren to benefit from coral reefs, Dr. Hixon and   remain undeterred.   and its mission reminds us that fighting for the preservation of our natural wonders is not just a noble endeavor but an essential one. After all, “the best thing we can ever do is fight the good fight regardless of the probability of success.” We must continue to educate ourselves and others, and always advocate for sustainable fishing. Together, we can be the saviris and guardians of Hawaii’s reefs, ensuring they thrive for generations to come."

        "content": "As we step into the promising year of 2024, we want to express our deep appreciation to each and every one of our devoted supporters who have championed our mission to preserve the well-being of the world’s coral reefs. With your generous contributions, we are primed to direct our efforts toward programs that will mitigate the challenges faced by coral reefs, nurture local partnerships and communities, and push the boundaries of scientific research. This paves the way for the continued health and resilience of these invaluable ecosystems for generations to come. For those who are new to our cause, we invite you to be a vital force in protecting coral reefs in 2024 and beyond. Together, we can make a lasting impact on the health of coral reefs. Let’s explore the concrete outcomes your contributions will bring in 2024: Clean ocean water is crucial for the flourishing of coral reefs and the well-being of people. That’s why your support will scale-up our   in 2024. In early 2024 we will be sharing the success story of our wastewater pilot project in West End, Roatan with communities across the Western Caribbean.  We are hosting an in-person summit to gather support of funders, development banks, and government stakeholders so that we can scale. We will also be launching an on-line toolkit and guide so that communities have resources to set the stage for large-scale infrastructure improvements. Over the next 6-8 years, while we are building relationships and funding to scale globally, we’ll apply the lessons learned from our successful wastewater pilot project to enhance water quality in 5-7 communities across the   and  . Our ultimate goal is to ensure that 80% of coastal communities with priority coral reefs have wastewater treatment in place, guaranteeing clean waters for both the reefs and the people who rely on them. Coral reefs only thrive when they have healthy fish populations, which keep algal growth in check and provide nutrients for coral growth. That’s why we focus on  In 2024 we will be focused on ensuring that all of the marine protected areas (MPAs) and coastal environments where we currently work are appropriately resourced with real-time fisheries data, effective patrols to minimize illegal activities, funding strategies, and proper management plans.  This is critically important over the next year so that coral reefs bounce back from bleaching events. At the same time, we’ll be working towards bold goals to establish newly protected areas. Our ultimate goal is to create networks of effectively managed marine environments that are critical for healthy fisheries and resilient coastal communities. Our science shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if we curb carbon emissions and reduce local threats to coral reefs. Science also shows that greater genetic variability will help corals adapt to these warming temperatures—which is why it is important to protect a wide network of corals, so those that become more heat tolerant can spread their genes. CORAL is pioneering groundbreaking research with global partners to create a satellite-based tool that can monitor and predict the health and adaptability of coral reefs from space. Success in this endeavor would enable us to offer this innovative tool globally, empowering under-resourced communities with a cost-free resource to streamline their conservation efforts and decision-making processes. To expand our impact, we’re collaborating with scientists, conservationists, universities, and organizations to share our adaptation research findings and advocate for solutions that harness the power of evolution. Your generosity allows us to build stronger partnerships in the scientific community and contribute to 30 x 30 (30% of oceans protected by 2023) initiatives across the globe. In 2024 we will be taking all of the best management practices from our successful watershed restoration project in Maui and expand what we learned to new watersheds and partnerships. We’re collaborating with   to strengthen their efforts, secure funding, and prioritize sediment reduction across the state. Our ultimate objective is to share our insights and best practices more broadly across the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific. This way, we can assist communities and regions on a larger scale, making a substantial impact on the health of our coral reefs. Our ultimate goal long-term vision is to establish diverse, connected, large, and well-managed networks of coral reefs with sustainable fish populations and improved water quality. This means healthier and more resilient oceans for everyone, today and for generations to come."

        "content": "—Recent monitoring data collected from Los Micos Lagoon demonstrated a 483 percent increase in fish biomass after a closed fishing season in 2021, signifying both higher quantities and larger sizes of fish. Likewise, it showed an increase in diversity of species and trophic levels.  Los Micos Lagoon often suffers from overfishing, impacting populations of newborn fish that later swim into the ocean and occupy coral reefs. According to Julio San Martín Chicas, CORAL’s Principal Program Coordinator for the North Coast, if we want healthy coral reefs, we must also protect coastal lagoons. And for Tela Bay, a community deeply dependent on local catch and known for endangered corals, protecting reefs is essential.  To address the issue of overfishing, Tela’s local government started a closed season every year from May through June, a timeframe which prohibits fishing in coastal lagoons. This allows fish to grow and swim to coral reefs, thus repopulating stocks and minimizing the impacts of overfishing.  Overfishing occurs when people catch too many fish and the stocks are not able to replenish quickly enough. Not having enough fish can collapse entire reef ecosystems and impact the coastal communities reliant on them.  While this initiative originally started in 2010, it was unsuccessful until recently. According to San Martín Chicas, it was difficult to enforce the rules without sufficient patrols, financial support, and  .  But this year, better funding and on the ground support allowed Tela’s “closed season” to operate more effectively. In addition to CORAL’s financial and technical backing, PROLANSATE Foundation, National Institute of Forest Conservation and Development, General Directorate of Fisheries and Aquaculture (DIGEPESCA), the naval force and rangers were involved. In particular, DIGEPESCA provides preferential access to local artisanal fishers, instead of outside commercial entities—which has been a key component to empowering the Tela community. “This year was a success compared to other years,” said San Martín Chicas. “Community members have told me there was much more control on the water.”  Over the 54 patrol days in the 2021 closed season, 36 fishing nets, nine cast nets and three harpoons were all confiscated and donated to social aid institutions—likely saving hundreds of fish.  For the Tela community, this is great news. After all, fishing is the primary source of income and food for locals. A successful closed season can help ensure healthy fish stocks for subsequent months.  Sufficient fish populations are also significant for coral reefs. Herbivorous fish graze on seaweed, keeping algal growth in check. When their populations decline, they can’t keep up with the algae. As a result, algae can smother a reef.  Research also shows that fish in Tela are   to fish populations in the Honduran Caribbean, and possibly the entire Mesoamerican reef region. Therefore, repopulating fish in Tela, can also impact coral reefs that are hundreds of miles away.  In the future, San Martín Chicas hopes the closed season will continue its success. He’d also love to utilize this science-based information to help reform policies. As a next step, it would be optimal if the closed season was more closely aligned with the reproductive patterns of commercially important fish.  By leveraging new data and leading meaningful initiatives, we will continue to address overfishing and fight for the protection of coral reefs—both in Tela Bay and around the world. "

        "content": "On September 8, 2021, it was officially announced that a comprehensive map and monitoring system of the world’s shallow water coral reefs, the , was completed. This tremendous effort was led by Arizona State University in collaboration with scientists, universities, private entities, and NGOs across the globe—including the Coral Reef Alliance. The tool is the first of its kind, using advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images to capture valuable information about the world’s coral reefs in depths of up to 15 meters. The Allen Coral Atlas was named in memory of Paul G. Allen, Microsoft co-founder, passionate diver, and philanthropist, who was committed to expanding our understanding of coral reefs and driving policies to protect them. Following his vision, the Atlas will provide marine conservationists and governments access to data about the location and health of coral reefs. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, has been involved with the project since its early days, and sees the value of this new technology and how it can contribute to reef conservation and management. “About three quarters of the world’s reefs have inadequate mapping and monitoring,” says Fox. “So this helps fill that data gap.” This scientific advance comes at a critical time in history—a time where we will determine the fate of the world’s coral reefs. Every year,  , along with   and an increasing number of coral bleaching events. In fact, scientists estimate that half of the world’s reef-building corals have already disappeared—impacting marine ecosystems and coastal communities alike. But this new technology has the potential to help put us on the right track. The maps serve multiple purposes, acting as a resource for marine spatial planning, aid for hurricane recovery, as well as data to analyze pollution and inform proposed policies for fishing regulations. It is also particularly useful when monitoring coral bleaching, a potentially deadly phenomenon that occurs when water temperatures become too warm and corals become stressed. So far, the Allen Coral Atlas is being used in more than 30 countries and for more than 50 conservation projects. It is free, accessible, and comes with online training tools and workshops. In places like Sri Lanka and the Philippines, the Atlas is already being used when establishing marine protected areas. “The right information and reliable updated data is very important in planning and decision making,” says Reynante Ramilo, a Program Coordinator for Community Centered Conservation in the Philippines. “The Atlas maps will enhance our work toward more efficient biophysical assessment of the marine habitats that, together with the community, we jointly aim to protect and manage through the establishment of marine protected areas.” As more conservation initiatives and locations utilize the Atlas, field scientists are continually ground truthing its accuracy. CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager   is a big part of that effort. Rivera-Sosa is working to bring together a collaborative, global network of field scientists who can verify coral bleaching events that satellites are detecting from space. As a technology, the Allen Coral Atlas provides an incredible opportunity for the conservation science community to collaborate together and work toward our shared goal to save coral reefs. At CORAL, we are optimistic that this tool will assist in our efforts to respond to coral bleaching and mitigate direct reef threats, like water pollution and overfishing. “Now that we’ve mapped the world’s shallow coral reefs, we’re moving on to new areas of innovation,” says Dr. Greg Asner, the Director of Allen Coral Atlas. “It’s our goal to support conservation, management, and policy around coral reefs for generations to come.”"

        "content": "That’s right, underwater communities are breaking all the rules and thriving in unexpected conditions. Our field teams are studying these reefs across the globe—from Tela Bay, Honduras to Hilo, Hawaii. Maybe they’re onto something. Could these misbehaving coral reefs be the key to unlocking the secrets of climate adaptation for all coral reefs? We are working alongside the   to study their characteristics because they may provide valuable insights for our conservation efforts. Misbehaving coral reefs are those that are thriving in conditions that would normally be considered unfavorable for coral growth. For example, some coral reefs are growing in areas with high levels of turbidity, where murky water blocks sunlight and reduces photosynthesis. According to Melanie McField, Director of the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative (HRI), “these reefs in Honduras are defying our expectations of what coral can tolerate and where it can thrive. We would expect these reefs to be overgrown with algae and have very low coral cover. But instead, we are seeing one of the highest in the whole Caribbean. They’re not reading the coral reef ecology textbooks!” Climate change is causing rising sea temperatures, increased ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms, all of which are placing stress on coral reefs. However, if we can identify the factors that allow misbehaving coral reefs to thrive, we may be able to use this knowledge to help other reefs adapt to changing conditions. One theory is that misbehaving coral reefs may have   that allow them to tolerate different environmental conditions. For example, some corals may have evolved to tolerate high levels of turbidity by growing thicker tissue or producing more mucus to protect their delicate polyps from sediment particles. All corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, but some may have adapted to higher nutrient levels, and we need to research why. The rate of change in nutrient concentrations is likely very important. Similarly, the increased turbidity in some areas may be providing a protective layer that shields coral from ultraviolet light that can exacerbate coral bleaching in times of high heat stress. Whatever the reason for their success, misbehaving coral reefs offer valuable insights for conservation efforts,” says Jennifer Myton, CORAL’s Conservation Program Director. “By studying these reefs, researchers can identify the factors that allow them to thrive and use this knowledge to develop strategies for protecting other reefs in the face of climate change. For example, if genetic adaptations are the key to misbehaving coral reefs’ success, conservationists could focus on fully protecting reefs with these uniquely adapted corals. Melanie believes that “the opportunity here not only lies in the science to discover why these reefs are misbehaving but also in the conservation work to ensure their protection. We need to get these reefs into  . This will ensure that overfishing is reduced, and we can build resilience. Sometimes unexpected behavior is good.”  CORAL and HRI have a shared vision to increase protections of coral reefs that can be key to long-term preservation and climate adaptation. The work ahead will be community-informed, science-driven—and will hopefully solve the mystery of misbehaving reefs. We will keep you updated on these rebellious reefs as we learn more. We are hopeful that we will identify the factors that allow them to thrive and use this knowledge to develop strategies for protecting other reefs in the face of climate change. With the right conservation efforts, we may be able to help coral reefs continue to provide vital ecosystem services for generations to come."

        "content": "Reef-building corals have faced unprecedented damage over the past century, primarily due to increasing human pressure on coral communities.  One of the most devastating challenges faced by Caribbean corals is the outbreak of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), which was first detected in Florida in 2014. Since then, it has rapidly spread to 26 countries in the wider Caribbean, causing severe impacts on susceptible coral reefs. Our partners, Roatan Marine Park and Bay Islands Conservation Association, have been monitoring the progression of SCTLD in the Bay Islands of Honduras for 2 years. Here are some highlights of the efforts made in collaboration with the Bay Islands Technical Committee to mitigate its effects and raise awareness. In January 2020, monitoring efforts to detect SCTLD commenced on the island of Roatan in Honduras, following its first report in Flowers Bay in September 2020. Utilizing the rover diver methodology (swimming over coral reefs for observation), presence-absence data were collected to track the disease’s progression. Over a period of 13 months, SCTLD spread across the Bay Islands, affecting at least 28 stony coral species.  Roatan and Utila were the most impacted islands, with the disease encircling them rapidly at a rate of approximately 155 m/day. Geographical patterns also emerged, with faster disease progression observed on the windward side of Roatan compared to the leeward side. While we don’t yet know the exact causes of SCTLD,   are believed to play a part in its spread. On the natural side,   seem to be correlated with SCTLD outbreaks. For instance, higher water temperatures and specific surface current conditions might be linked to disease outbreaks. On the human side, activities such as   may unintentionally help propagate SCTLD. Some theories point to ballast water and contaminated dive gear as possible carriers of the disease. High concentrations of dive centers and increased boat traffic in certain areas could exacerbate its spread.  Moreover, factors like   – often consequences of human activities – can further stress corals, increasing the likelihood of SCTLD outbreaks. All of these factors underline the complex nature of SCTLD and the need for continued research to better understand and counter this disease. The rapid spread of SCTLD in the Bay Islands underscores the urgent need for conservation measures. The high dependency of these islands on healthy coral reefs for tourism highlights the importance of addressing the impacts of the disease.  Collaborative efforts between non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government agencies, and local businesses have been crucial in assessing the severity of the disease, mitigating its effects, and raising awareness for coral reef conservation.  Our most effective tools for monitoring and intervention against this devastating disease are local NGOs and our dedicated partners. Their intimate knowledge of the environment and unwavering commitment to its protection are invaluable. By harnessing this collaborative power, there is hope for coral reefs. The rapid spread of stony coral tissue loss disease in the Honduran Bay Islands serves as a  . To combat this devastating disease and protect the invaluable ecosystems it threatens, we must come together and take intentional action.  Here are two actionable ways you can contribute: If you’re interested in delving deeper into the research and understanding the complexities of SCTLD and its spread in the Bay Islands, .

The wildfire in Maui has cast a shadow of ash and tragedy over the island’s landscape, as well as over the Coral Reef Alliance as an organization.   Maui – and more specifically the historic town of Lahaina – is home to CORAL colleagues, friends, family, supporters, and a field site of our conservation programming.   The devastating wildfire has not only impacted the lives and livelihoods of the residents, but it has also destroyed vast areas of natural habitat – on land and in the water – that hold cultural, economic, and environmental value.  The human lives that have been lost and affected by this tragedy are our primary focus at this time. Our colleagues, community of supporters, volunteers, and local partners – those that make CORAL’s work possible – and all of their loved ones are at the forefront of our minds. The Lahaina wildfire sadly claimed numerous businesses, the homes of our community partners, and over one hundred lives. First responders and search crews continue to work diligently as hundreds of people remain unaccounted for.

        "content": "Currently, population growth in coastal areas has led to an increase in fishing activity in different parts of the world. Naturally, higher populations demand greater economic outputs as the need for food and household income also grows. Coastal communities such as those in Honduras’ Tela Bay are experiencing significantly greater pressures on fishing resources and, in effect, on coral reefs. Our team in Honduras has spent the past few years diligently crafting the design and implementation of innovative and sustainable economic alternatives to fishing in water that are critical coral reef areas. Through this program we are giving families financial independence while reducing overfishing pressures. One of these alternatives is aquaponics with native species, which leverages the power of mariculture.   Mariculture is essentially underwater agriculture – it’s aquaculture. But, what does that actually look like?  While critical marine organisms like oysters, algae and seaweed can be farmed and raised   of the ocean, mariculture is the cultivation of these marine organisms using their natural habitats. By leveraging the power of the ocean, mariculture creates a lifeline for coastal communities and the fragile marine environments they depend on. The aquaponic systems that CORAL is installing in Tela Bay, Honduras, capitalizes on the power of mariculture for the sake of rebounding overfished areas in order to protect coral reefs. The benefits of mariculture are vast and vital. This approach to offset the consequences of overfishing also helps mitigate nutrient pollution, provides essential habitats for marine life, supports fish stocks, reduces local climate change impacts, and generates income for communities—all while preserving the environment. Mariculture offers a sustainable path forward for coastal regions worldwide. In July, CORAL’s own Julio San Martin Chicas – our Program Coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras – participated in a hands-on mariculture course provided by Dr. Lonnie Kaczmarsky at the Institute for Tropical Ecology and Conservation in Bocas del Toro, Panama. This course expanded Julio’s knowledge on the subject matter as well as his approach to strengthening CORAL’s aquaponics initiative. His participation in the course also starts to fill an opportunity gap not only for CORAL and our partners, but also for Honduras, as Julio is the first Honduran to participate in this program. We hope that by attending and implementing the lessons that he learned in Panama in Honduras, Julio will be the first of many Hondurans to implement this approach alongside our community partners. ITEC’s program teaches conservationists and citizen scientists how mariculture has the power to sustainably alleviate pressures that coral reefs face, especially in the ever-changing environmental conditions spurred on by climate change. Julio is all about science in action and science for action. Utilizing mariculture as an approach to saving coral reefs isn’t just about growing our knowledge base; it’s about creating a ripple effect of positive change. By empowering individuals like Julio and organizations like CORAL with the right skills and resources, mariculture sets the stage for transformative progress in coral conservation. CORAL is dedicated to promoting sustainable fisheries as a way to bolster the resilience of coastal communities and coral reefs. Mariculture aligns with this mission, offering a way to promote economic stability for coastal communities in Honduras while also preserving the threatened coral reef ecosystems that support them. Now, thanks to Julio and this course, we are one step closer to our goal of protecting and restoring coral reefs in the North Coast of Honduras and beyond."

By monitoring reefs and supporting our partners who have advocated for funds to fight SCTLD, we’ve made a lot of progress. Now, scientists are applying a topical antibiotic around the diseased patches of coral, while also identifying the species that are less affected by SCTLD and focusing on ways to ensure these corals can reproduce.  Your ongoing support has given our partners the resources and ability to prepare and react to this deadly coral disease.

In 2022, we have advanced our watershed restoration project in West Maui, which focuses on decreasing sediment runoff that reaches coral reefs.  West Maui used to have an abundance of pineapple and sugarcane plantations, which are now out-of-use and have left the land degraded. On rainy days, sediment from these landscapes slides down old dirt roads, into streams, and eventually lands in the ocean and settles on coral reefs. When runoff and land-based pollution enter coral reef ecosystems, they can reduce corals’ access to sunlight and promote algae growth. And when there is too much algae, it can take over space from reef-building corals and ultimately, make it difficult for them to stay healthy and survive.  That’s why our dedicated team members and partners in Hawai‘i are restoring the watershed by installing native plants and vegetation to trap sediment and prevent runoff from reaching the ocean. Thanks to generous donations and hardworking volunteers, we have been able to advance the project in 2022 and continue our work to protect coral reefs. Here is what we’ve accomplished so far: "

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Could aquaponics and aquaculture be a sustainable alternative to overfishing? According to Julio San Martin Chicas, our Principal Program Coordinator in Tela Bay, Honduras, the answer is yes: If specific fish can be adequately and competitively farmed using small-scale aquaculture, then we can alleviate fishing pressure on the reef. Aquaculture refers to the practice of cultivating aquatic organisms, usually fish, under controlled conditions. Aquaponics is one step up—it introduces plants, such as leafy greens, into the aquaculture system. The nutrients derived from fish droppings fertilize the plants, allowing one to farm fish and grow food at the same time. San Martin Chicas and Paula Urrutia, one of our community scientists in Tela, are testing the theory that aquaculture could be a more ecologically sustainable alternative to the continuous harvest of wild fish stocks. The team believes aquaculture can also reduce food insecurity and increase fisher income. They setup a test system in early 2020, but then heavy rains hit Honduras and they learned the hard way that an aquaculture system should be covered—the freshwater changed the pH of the water and the fish died. Not long after, COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders began, and the project was put on hold. “After taking a break during COVID, we just started the system up again in January,” says San Martin Chicas. San Martin Chicas and Urrutia are using the project as an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of running a local aquaculture system so they can turn around and teach fishers how to build their own systems at home. “Our goal is to learn the fish lifecycle and how to commercialize it,” says San Martin Chicas. “We’re starting with aquaculture and hoping to grow it into a whole aquaponics system so that people can also grow their own food.” A typical aquaculture system uses tilapia, a native fish of tropical and subtropical Africa and the Middle East. But growing tilapia would be a risky move in Tela. “If tilapia were to escape here, it would become invasive,” says San Martin Chicas. “Instead, we’re using a native fish that is from the tilapia family, called copetona, so that it doesn’t have the potential to threaten the ecosystem.” Tela has been hit hard by overfishing over the years. Tela Bay sits adjacent to a lagoon, which is a popular fish nursery ground. CORAL works with fishers in the area to help relieve fishing pressure. “Tela Bay is an area with lots of fishers and they rely on their fish,” says San Martin Chicas. “Trying to take them off fishing isn’t going to work because that style of work becomes their identity. The goal is to provide them with an income and take some of the pressure off the reef—it’s not going to eliminate fishing, but it can reduce the pressure and make it more sustainable.”"

She arrives at the first site at 7:00 a.m., where she meets long-time community volunteer Keith Neal. They put their masks on, unload the testing equipment and Perez wades her way to knee-deep water to collect their first water quality sample. Neal stays behind to watch the equipment. It’s the first of five sites they will collect samples from that morning, trying to hit all before the sun has a chance to break down bacteria. Once sampling is finished around noon, they part ways and Perez travels south to drop the samples off at two different laboratories before making her way back home to wait for the results. The sampling is part of an island-wide collaborative effort that Perez launched as CORAL’s Program Manager on Hawai‘i Island. The project, called Hawai‘i Wai Ola, brings together eleven different organizations, volunteer community members, and scientists to champion water quality issues on Hawai‘i Island. Right now, the Hawai‘i Department of Health samples and reports on water quality at sites around the island. But their resources are scarce, so sampling is limited and inconsistent. “Our capacity on-island has been hit hard the last five years between hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and now COVID,” explains Perez. “If we want to continue to be informed and have vital information about our water resources while our government is so strained, then we need to support our government in as many ways as we can.” The plan was to launch a volunteer team this summer that would regularly collect water quality samples in Kona, Hilo and South Kohala. Their efforts would bring a more robust and consistent understanding of water quality issues across Hawai‘i Island and reduce some of the pressure on the Hawai‘i Department of Health. But when COVID-19 hit, the volunteer program was put on hold and in-person training was canceled. As case numbers continued to rise on the island, it became near impossible to allow groups of volunteers to gather in a safe manner to sample, let alone to be trained. And beaches were closed, so team members couldn’t access sampling sites. Typically, a sampling team consists of three people. “The sites are really spread out and there is a lot of equipment,” describes Perez. “It’s hard to load and unload on your own, and you can’t just leave thousands of dollars of equipment on a table while you run into the water to collect a sample.” However, Erica and other Hawai‘i Wai Ola members have been forced to occasionally go out on their own, taking advantage of regulatory exemptions to access beaches when possible. That’s because this is a prime time for sampling. There’s a silver-lining to the fact that tourism was restricted in the islands and most beach activities were forbidden: the team had an opportunity to understand what water quality looks like when no one is visiting the beaches. “I can’t stress enough the importance of collecting data when people weren’t using the resources.” says Perez. “There were no tourists. Only a few locals were on the beach, very few people were using sunscreen and getting in the water. It was the perfect opportunity to create a baseline for what minimum-use looks like. Then, when things fully reopen, we can look at that baseline again with more people and more use and compare the two.” Perez is excited for the opportunity to gain a better understanding of how much human use and tourism affects water quality—even if it means continuing to collect samples herself with just one other person to help. It’s an opportunity they wouldn’t have had if 2020 hadn’t brought so many challenges. In the meantime, though, she’s working hard to convert the volunteer training into an online platform so volunteers will be ready and prepared to start sampling when it’s safe."

        "content": "The Hawai‘i County Council on March 3 voted to approve the allocation of $1.8 million to address ocean sewage pollution in Puakō, Hawai‘i. The Puakō coastline is one of 14 priority sites that have been identified in Hawai‘i as areas to be transitioned off of cesspools. Across the state, an estimated 88,000 cesspools release 53 million gallons of raw sewage into the groundwater every day. In waterways and coastal areas, like Puakō, it is sometimes mere hours before that sewage enters the marine environment. The Puakō community is leading the way in this transition to improved wastewater treatment. Since 2014, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) has worked alongside the Puakō community under their Clean Water for Reefs program to address wastewater pollution on the Puakō reef. Along the Puakō coast there are 643 homes that use cesspool, septic systems, and aerobic treatment systems— but due to Hawai‘i Island’s highly porous geology, those systems mean that untreated sewage often leaks directly into the ocean. “In some places, if you flush your toilet in the evening, and you go for a swim in the morning, you’re actually swimming in your own sewage,” says Dr. Steven Colbert of the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo. Untreated sewage contains harmful bacteria, pathogens and nutrients that pose a risk to human health and coral reefs. The increase of nutrients in the ocean can lead to coral disease and cause destructive algal blooms that can kill corals and damage the coral reef ecosystem. In 2019, the Hawai‘i Department of Health allocated $1.5 million to the project, provided the County of Hawai‘i matched those funds by twenty percent. On March 3, Hawai‘i County Council voted to encumber those funds and agreed to the $300,000 match—bringing the project total to $1.8 million. The funds will support the development of a Puakō facilities plan for a wastewater system. “This is a huge win for the Puakō community,” says Erica Perez, Senior Program Manager at the Coral Reef Alliance. “It took a lot of people to make this happen, and we are so incredibly grateful to all of our partners for supporting clean water for communities and coral reefs.”"

According to the RRN’s survey results, one participant from Brazil is now ready to conduct a baseline assessment and water quality program in Fernando de Noronha, while another participant from Puerto Rico will use social media to educate the local community about wastewater.  “Coral reef populations have become so decimated,” says Perez. “In response, I believe that people want to act…not just sit back and watch.”  For years, Perez and the CORAL team have been fighting to save some of the most ecologically important coral reefs in Puakō, Hawai’i.  Across the main Hawaiian Islands, it’s estimated that roughly 53 million gallons of raw sewage are released into the ocean from cesspools every day.   that bacterial levels on the Puakō coastline are not in compliance with the standards set by the Hawai‘i Department of Health—and that action must be taken.  In response, we’ve partnered with the Puakō community to advocate for a wastewater treatment plant, with many residents understanding the vital impact clean water has on both their health and nearby coral reefs. “I’m thrilled to share my knowledge after years of advocating for clean water in Hawai’i,” says Perez. “By bringing together our resources at CORAL and the educational tools at the RRN, I believe we will reach more people and create a larger impact worldwide.” "

        "content": "The small-fishing village of Tulamben in Bali struggled with poverty for decades, but that changed with a series of unfortunate events a few decades ago. The USS Liberty beached along its rocky shore after being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in 1942. And in 1963 the eruption of Mount Agung pushed the ship into the ocean, making it quickly one of the most well-known wreck dives in the world. It wasn’t long before tourism became the main source of income for the community. Today, Tulamben is known as one of the best dive spots in Bali, and the USS Liberty wreck can see upwards of 100 people per day during the high season. But with tourism comes more people, and more people means more stress on the marine ecosystems. We started working with the Tulamben community in 2013 to help them manage their coral reefs, and the community is starting to mobilize to take action—notably in the area of waste management. As it is in many other places in Bali, waste management is a challenge in Tulamben, especially during the rainy season. Tulamben, located at the base of Mount Agung in the North East of Bali, is one of the driest places on the island. Rain is a luxury there, but when it comes, it washes the volcanic sediment and trash that has accumulated in the dry river beds straight into the ocean, burying the nearshore coral reefs. The village planned and held a community-wide beach cleanup on February 25, 2015, to help remove some of the debris and bring attention to this issue within the broader community. More than 80 people attended the event, including Nyoman Ardika, the head of Tulamben village, and Komang Agus Sukasena, the head of the environmental agency. “We need both healthy coral reefs and clean beaches for tourists to keep coming to Tulamben,” shared Veronika Niken, one of my coworkers here in Indonesia. “We were excited to see such a great turn-out at the event and to see the community really come together to protect their coral reefs.” As a next step, community leaders have begun collaborating with their local government to rehabilitate some of their coral reefs. To further quote Veronica, “We look forward to continuing to support this village. We’re excited to see what the future holds for their reefs and and to keep partnering with them in their important efforts.”      "

        "content": "Earlier this year, thanks to support from the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority, we were able to set up two display cases in the Maui airport to educate travelers about the importance of protecting coral reefs. The cases highlight some easy ways visitors and locals can protect reefs, and feature a crochet coral reef made out of plarn, or plastic yarn, by The Pennington School. We were thrilled to be able to highlight the Crochet Reef Project and use it to help bring awareness to the struggle coral reefs face around the world. Read more about this project in the article below, written by one of The Pennington School teachers. In 2008, the sixth grade entered into an interdisciplinary unit (IDU) during the fourth quarter. The broad topic was marine biology, but the focus in 2011 was on coral reef ecology. In science, topics included animals and ecology of the reef, reefs as indicators of global change, and ocean pollution. The main connection to humanities was the link to the study of the Wonders of the World, specifically the Great Barrier Reef. In addition, culture surrounding reef areas and community efforts to save the reef were major topics. Math and languages played a smaller role, but there were still facets of this IDU incorporated in these subjects. Each year, the IDU ended with a culminating display for parents and community members. Highlights of this exhibit were projects and student work from the IDU. In addition, the class as a whole took on one major project to showcase at this event. In 2011, the sixth grade created a Crochet Coral Reef. Started in Australia in 2005, the Crochet Coral Reef is a worldwide project which blends art, science, math, and environmental awareness. Our hope was to create the reef entirely out of plastic yarn (plarn), through the collection of plastic bags at school. Students learned to create the plarn, crochet it, and develop structures that mimic the coral and other sea life commonly found in a reef habitat. In doing so, our hope was to draw attention to the consumption of plastic products and the impact they have on our oceans. Our plastic reef has traveled quite a bit since then. In 2011, our efforts earned a place in The Institute For Figuring’s Satellite Reef program. That same year, our reef was on display in our school gallery and then traveled to the Williamson Gallery, Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena, CA. Quite a few crocheted pieces were on display in their Hyperbolic: Reefs, Rubbish, and Reason exhibit. Next stop…the Maui Airport. Tara Jennings (former middle school science teacher) and I were so delighted to learn that our reef would be speaking to another audience, many miles away from New Jersey. We applaud the Coral Reef Alliance’s efforts and we appreciate your interest in our “plarn” creations. “My soul is full of longing \nfor the secret of the sea, \nand the heart of the great ocean \nsends a thrilling pulse through me.” \n― "

        "content": "After writing about West Maui for over five years as CORAL’s grants manager, I finally had the opportunity to visit the island on a recent vacation. I got to see first-hand how West Maui’s hotels and resorts are literally the last line of defense for adjacent coral reefs. Driving the North Loop Coastline Road Hwy 30, you are feet away from the ocean; as you approach Lahaina, resorts grow in size and grandeur, hugging every inch of land to maximize beach access. One of the highlights of driving this road—for the inner CORAL-geek in me—was seeing several of our   signs. Not only was there one at the hotel I was staying at, but I also saw signs at many of the beaches I visited or drove by. CORAL has helped install more than 50 of these signs throughout the Hawaiian Islands, educating snorkelers and beachgoers about the many types of coral and marine life they may encounter and providing tips on how to enjoy the reefs without damaging them. These signs are just one way we are working to engage local stakeholders and visitors alike; more recently, we have expanded our engagement to address water use and land-based sources of pollution. In West Maui, dozens of hotels are partnering with us, keen on learning what role they can play in reducing their use of fresh water and increasing their sustainable business practices. To date, Maui hotel properties have implemented over 30 sustainability projects from energy and water reduction initiatives, to landscaping best management practices, to guest and employee outreach. One outing that really brought the issue of land-based sources of pollution to light for me was a trip to Ho’okipa Beach on the north shore of Maui. The beach is a great place to watch surfers and we had stopped in to marvel at all the talent on demand. From the lookout point, we soon realized there were other creatures vying for our attention: several Hawaiian green sea turtles ( ) were making their way to a quiet corner of the shore to bask, a rare behavior documented only in Hawai‘i  and Australia. As many as 70 turtles have been recorded at one time. The Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund maintains a presence on this beach to ensure that the turtles are not disturbed by excited fans. Descending from the lookout point to get a closer look, it didn’t take long to notice that one of the turtles was covered in tumors. According to  , fibropapillomatosis is a non-malignant tumor-forming disease first discovered in Hawai‘i in 1958. Initially the disease was found only in green turtles, but it is now spreading to other species worldwide. It is the leading cause of death in green turtles. The direct cause/link is uncertain, but   by Duke University, the University of Hawai‘i, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicate that the disease is more prevalent in areas where there is an excess of nitrogen runoff from land. While humans do not seem to be affected by this virus, turtles are the prime victims of this excess pollution; their only source of food is the nitrogen-polluted algae, which ultimately leads to these debilitating tumors and premature death. As CORAL’s grants manager, I have written countless proposals discussing threats to coral reefs; many of these threats degrade reefs over time, dispelling some of the urgency to act now, as the impact isn’t always clear or immediate. Seeing this turtle first-hand highlighted a clear connection between land-based sources of pollution and the health of the marine environment. Our reefs—and our turtles—are literally dying, and if we don’t fix the problem at the source soon, we may have no marine life left to save."

Why protect herbivores? Because they are the reef cleaners. If there is too much algae on a reef, it can smother and kill corals. Herbivores do an excellent job keeping algae in check. The KHFMA stretches from Black Rock to the south end of Honokowai Park. Within these boundaries, rudderfish (nenue), parrotfish (uhu), and surgeonfish such as the convict tang (manini), and sea urchins are protected. Catching or gathering of these species is not permitted. So, is it working, and how do we know if it’s working? Since 2008, before the creation of the KHFMA, this reef has been monitored. With the establishment of the KHFMA we’ve seen an increase in the numbers of herbivorous fish as well as an increase in their overall size. Fish sizes and numbers have also increased in the areas adjacent to the KHFMA, which means more fish for fishermen, and more food for predator fish like ulua which fishermen love to catch! There are also promising signs of improved reef health, though it is still too soon to tell because coral takes many decades to grow. If fish size and numbers increase within the KHFMA they will continue to keep harmful algal blooms from occurring. That’s why more herbivores are mo’ bettah! For more information, visit "

        "content": "How often have we seen it here on Maui? After a heavy rain, parking lots and streets turn into shallow lakes and streams. Your guests have to tip toe through muddy water, or jump over oily puddles to get from their cars to the hotel lobby. What if there was a pavement or concrete that could allow rainwater to pass right through it, sinking safely into the ground, eliminating the need for expensive storm drains or gutters, and keeping polluted runoff from entering the ocean? Thankfully there is—pervious concrete! Pervious concrete is a special mixture of gravel, cement, water, and a little bit of sand. Once it dries it creates a durable pavement that has an open-cell, or pervious, structure, permitting water to trickle through. Pervious concrete can be used in most of the same applications as regular concrete, is ADA compliant, and costs roughly the same amount to install and maintain, though it does require a trained pervious concrete technician. Pervious concrete has been successfully used for: If you have ever visited the USS Arizona Memorial on Oahu, you probably weren’t there to examine the pavement, but the parking lot which sees over one million visitors a year utilizes pervious concrete for its parking stalls. For those wishing to check out an example here on Maui, swing by the new Bank of Hawai’i at 140 Hoohana St in Kahului (across from the Safeway) where pervious concrete was recently installed in the parking lot. While there are a number of pervious options for hardscaped areas like paving blocks, stepping stones, and grass paving cells, pervious pavement could be a good option if you want the look and feel of regular concrete, but with the advantage of stormwater infiltration. Remember, the more you can use pervious options for hardscaped areas within your property, the less polluted stormwater runoff you’ll have to deal with and the less of this pollution will enter the ocean. For more information about pervious concrete uses, or to find a contractor for your project, see   or contact Wayne Kawano of the Cement and Concrete Products Industry of Hawaii at 808-848-7100 or "

It’s not every day that you hear about conservation efforts that have enhanced people’s lives, and it’s such a powerful thing to know that communities can really thrive and benefit from protecting their natural resources. So when I hear about how our work translates into benefits for local communities, it warms me from the inside out. I had one of those moments recently when speaking with Juliane Diamond, one of our program managers. She was in Fiji last month, and attended a stakeholders meeting for the Namena Marine Reserve. The meeting was held by the Kubulau Resource Management Committee (KRMC), a local NGO we’re working with to protect the Reserve. Juliane was there along with about twenty other people—a mix of community members, dive operators, KRMC members, local authority figures, and more. They joined together to talk about the year’s progress, and the future of the reserve. When we met to talk about her trip, Juliane reminded me that the Namena Marine Reserve sold over 1,600 dive tags last year—more than ever before. They sold so many that they ran out halfway through the year and had to order more. The dive tags generate much needed revenue for the reserve and not only help fund management efforts, but are also used to directly benefit the neighboring Kubulau community. So these extra funds mean that the local community can install shelters and make repairs at bus stops, so community members don’t have to wait for buses in the rain. The funds are also used to provide scholarships for children of the Kubulau community to go to school. Juliane had a chance to catch up with Sereima Kalouniviti, a scholarship recipient from 2007. She received a scholarship to help her complete her bachelor’s in Applied Science, and is now working for the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. “I felt relieved that there was something there that could help me finish my degree and get to graduate,” said Kalouniviti. “If [the scholarship] hadn’t existed, I don’t know if I would have been able to afford it.” According to Aborosio Dulunaqio, a KRMC member, “Namena is a source of life for Kubulau.” And it really is. Surrounding the tiny island of Namenalala, the approximately 70 square kilometer Namena Marine Reserve was established in 1997, when community members successfully banned commercial fishing within the region. We’ve been working with the community to help them address illegal poaching in the Reserve, and to help enhance the dive tag system and generate more revenue for the Reserve and the community. While the reserve helps preserve such an incredible underwater treasure and popular dive spot, it is also so much more. No one could have said it better than Fiji resident and KRMC member Tevita Uluiburotu: “CORAL and Namena carry the hopes and future generations of Kubulau.” For more information about the Namena Marine Reserve and the Kubulau community, visit  ."

        "content": "Another widespread bleaching event has begun, and all eyes are focused on the Great Barrier Reef. This is the sixth mass bleaching event impacting Australia’s famous reefs and is driven largely by the planet’s rising ocean temperatures.  In recent weeks, field scientists and   have reported signs of minor to severe bleaching on different sections of the Great Barrier Reef and so far, our observations through the   also confirm this data.  The event is developing as the United Nations does a 10-day monitoring mission of the Great Barrier Reef, with results to be discussed at an important World Heritage Committee meeting in June.  We are working directly with the Atlas, the world’s first comprehensive map of shallow water coral reefs, to improve monitoring of bleaching events. Thanks to advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images, we can detect the conditions of coral reefs in different parts of the world. The Atlas is testing a new   that measures the brightness of coral reefs and categorizes whether bleaching risk is low, moderate, or severe. CORAL’s Program and Outreach Manager, Andrea Rivera-Sosa, is currently collaborating with field scientists in Australia to groundtruth the data collected by the tool. “Many scientists are monitoring right now and sharing information on reef conditions. By matching their findings with the Atlas’s bleaching monitoring system, we can help validate the Atlas’s algorithm,” says Rivera-Sosa. “This will further strengthen the capacity of the bleaching monitoring system to better inform scientists around the world.”  If the Atlas can successfully determine where and when bleaching occurs, it will help scientists better track these events, and help communities advocate for regulations that reduce local stressors in areas impacted by bleaching. Minimizing direct threats, like overfishing and water pollution, while also reducing carbon emissions, will give coral reefs a better chance of surviving and recuperating from these widespread bleaching events, and ultimately adapting to warmer waters. The first global mass bleaching event occurred in 1998, and sadly, these instances have become more and more frequent. Scientists and environment advocates are strongly urging governments, corporations, and individuals to take actions that will help reduce global C02 emissions. As for coral reef experts, we are working to keep reefs healthy enough to survive the warming temperatures.  When ocean waters are too warm, coral reefs get stressed. As a reaction, hard corals expel their small, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in the coral tissue and act as their primary food source. Without zooxanthellae, corals begin to bleach and are at risk of dying if they remain in this state for too long.  We’ve already lost 14 percent of the world’s corals in the last decade and we can’t afford to lose more. After all, coral reefs act as a home to 25 percent of marine species, protect coastlines, boost economies, and feed millions of people. We need to  —to protect the Great Barrier Reef and other key reef networks around the world.   "

        "content": "Forty underwater temperature loggers now sit underwater on coral reefs across the Bay Islands in Honduras. Their purpose? To identify the temperature range that corals can withstand and typically experience within a year.  These ONSET TidBits, as they’re known, measure water temperatures every minute and store the data internally. Every four to five months, a diver heads underwater to download the data provided by the temperature loggers. The data gives our scientists a better idea of the types of temperatures coral reefs experience in the area. But it could also be the key to helping coral reefs adapt to climate change. Most coral reefs have a narrow temperature range in which they can thrive. When waters get too warm, many hard corals will bleach—they’ll expel zooxanthellae, tiny algae that live inside the coral tissue and photosynthesize, providing the coral with an important food source. If ocean temperatures come back down within a few weeks, the zooxanthellae will return and the corals can recover. But if temperatures stay high, the corals can ultimately die.  Across the globe we’re seeing an increase in both the frequency and severity of coral bleaching events as ocean temperatures rise. But there is hope. Some corals have survived warming ocean temperatures—these heat-tolerant corals are the key to spreading heat tolerance to other reefs, which will be crucial as ocean temperatures continue to warm. If we protect corals on “hot reefs,” as well as the cooler reefs where their larvae are settling, we can help coral reefs adapt to future environmental conditions and evolve. And gaining a better understanding of the temperature ranges that coral reefs typically experience will help us get there.  Governments, scientists, communities, and conservationists work diligently around the world to put protections into place for their marine environments. So how can we help them design protected area networks in a way that allows for the spread of heat-tolerant genes?  Our TidBit research hopes to inform this question.  The temperature loggers were placed at 20 sites around the Bay Islands, with two loggers per site, about 200-400 meters apart. Scientists took georeferenced photos of the reef along the transects between the two temperature loggers, so temperature data can be compared to a reef’s composition. Now, we can start to answer questions like “can reefs with more species diversity or greater structural complexity also tolerate more heat?” Scientists hypothesize that by better understanding the relationship between a reef’s structure and a reef’s temperature range, we can create a tool that would allow practitioners around the world to estimate a coral reef’s adaptation potential.  Let’s say there is a strong relationship between reef structure and heat tolerance—for example, reefs that are more structurally complex tend to be more heat tolerant. If that’s the case, then couldn’t tools like the  , that can detect a reef’s structure using satellite imagery, also tell us whether or not a reef is more heat tolerant? And if the Atlas is free and online, then couldn’t governments use it to help determine which reefs they should protect based on which reefs are more likely to spread heat tolerance? We are actively working with our local partners to gather and analyze the Tidbit data that is being collected across Honduras. We’re also looking to expand the TidBit data collection to other locations to see if the relationship between reef structural complexity and temperature in the Mesoamerican Reef region is the same in other locations.  With our partners, we’re investigating whether we can use tools like the Atlas to provide open-access information about a coral reef’s adaptation potential. And if the answer is positive, it could change how marine protected area networks are prioritized and designed for decades to come. "

        "content": "Think back to 2020—hospital visits rose as COVID cases climbed, borders closed, businesses and schools shut down, and people panicked. The world we once knew spun upside down in a matter of days. And like so many, ocean conservation organizations, which depend highly on tourism revenue, suddenly faced unprecedented challenges as they worked to protect some of the planet’s most important ecosystems.  Fast forward two and a half years. The pandemic still lingers, but our local partners are thriving and conservation programs have stayed afloat—a truly remarkable accomplishment for coastal communities that watched their economies crumble overnight. In collaboration with   and thanks to a generous donation, we are so proud to have supported many of these tourism-dependent organizations during the pandemic and are thrilled to celebrate what they’ve accomplished. Two local partners worth highlighting are the   and  , who utilized CORAL and MAR Fund’s financial support in creative ways to keep their programs running, staff on the ground, and marine ecosystems protected. Let’s take a closer look at how these organizations found success during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Illegal fishing is a constant battle in marine protected areas, including the Bay Islands National Marine Park, which is co-managed by the RMP. Without patrol rangers patrolling the waters, vibrant fish populations will diminish and coral reef ecosystems could be impacted.  When COVID hit in 2020 and tourism revenue disappeared, the RMP prioritized their control and surveillance program and acted quickly to allow patrol rangers to stay on the water full-time, with non-patrol staff agreeing to temporarily cut their hours. In addition, the RMP found new sources of revenue to make up for the loss of tourism by ramping up their online presence and focusing on digital marketing and fundraising. It turned out to be a smart move—as the island of Roatan saw a 150% increase in illegal fishing in nearby coral reefs that year. According to Francis Leán, the executive director for the RMP, the team was successfully able to increase the number of patrol boats on the water, in order to keep up with the surge in illegal fishing. “The work of our patrol rangers is vital,” says Leán. “If it wasn’t for them, the coral reef wouldn’t be what it is today.”  Today, five boats continue to monitor the protected area. The patrol rangers, alongside the Honduran navy, have confiscated and recorded a total of 905 illegal fishing items since 2020, ultimately improving the health of Roatan’s coral reef ecosystems. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, TASA focused on developing a business plan to support the effective management of the Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, which boasts 342,000 acres of marine managed space within the Mesoamerican reef in Belize.  MAR Fund helped fund this plan, through the Belize Marine Fund and the MPA Emergency Funds Project that was developed with CORAL. The business plan was created by TASA and Blue Finance and puts emphasis on securing predictable sources of unrestricted funds to manage the reserve. According to Valdemar Andrade, executive director at TASA, oftentimes marine protected areas rely on short-term grants, which do not always secure long-term sustainability of an area’s conservation actions and the teams that drive these programs. By putting more emphasis on generating predictable, unrestricted funds, TASA is gaining financial autonomy to successfully manage the atoll long-term.  TASA’s strategy has allowed their team to focus on developing tourism infrastructure, designing a citizen science program, purchasing equipment to work with the fishing community, and much more. “My vision is to make the reserve a model marine reserve for Belize, where users take an active role in the management and decision-making of the reserve based on information received from stakeholders and science,” says Andrade.   By supporting CORAL, you are also supporting our dedicated partners, local communities, and alliances across the globe. Together, we have found success working directly with organizations like RMP and TASA, helping ensure they have the support necessary to carry out vital conservation programs dedicated to protecting ocean environments. "

        "content": "Tela Bay, Honduras has some of the healthiest corals along the Mesoamerican Reef, boasting an abundance of critically endangered species, averaging a high rate of coral cover, and providing an important source of coral larvae for the region. It’s why we work with local communities, scientists, and partners to protect Tela Bay and its natural resources. Most recently, we collaborated with local partners to finalize a management plan for Tela Bay’s Wildlife Refuge, a marine protected area that often suffers from the impacts of overfishing. The plan was recently approved by the government and will now act as a new tool to protect Tela’s coral reefs.  Back in 2017, Tela Bay was declared a marine protected area (MPA). But unfortunately, officials didn’t have the guidance or resources to truly preserve the bay effectively. That’s why we helped the Tela Bay Technical Committee, a local group made up of NGOs, governmental organizations, scientists, and community members, develop a management plan for the refuge. “The management plan is a result of the determination and dedication of our local community in Tela, who care deeply about protecting their resources,” says Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras. A fisheries plan, which the committee created to indicate sustainable fishing regulations in the region, was used as a base for developing Tela Bay’s full management plan. In addition to providing guidelines for healthy fisheries, the management plan now offers information on how to manage tourism, respect local customs and values, encourage environmental education, and more.  “Together, our goal is to offer guidance to officials so they are able to enforce regulations, support the livelihoods of communities, and ultimately protect Tela Bay,” says San Martin Chicas. “Establishing a plan will bring us one step closer to saving the region’s coral reefs.” What happens next is crucial. Across the globe, so many MPAs, like the Tela Bay Wildlife Refuge, are only protected  —but they aren’t properly managed in real life due to lack of enforcement, education, funding, or resources. Our work at CORAL is to ensure communities have a feasible plan in place and can effectively manage their MPAs and minimize the human impact.   In 2023, we will work to secure funding in order to implement the actions from Tela Bay’s management plan, which in turn will protect the area’s fisheries and coral reefs. From there, our scientists, partners, and community leaders will observe the bay, measure the effectiveness of new actions, and monitor the health of our beloved coral reef ecosystems. in supporting our on-the-ground staff and local partners in Tela, Honduras. With your help, we can preserve this ecologically important area and continue to support its coastal communities. "

        "content": "More than a quarter of coral reefs around the world are in a protected area—yet, according to Reefs at Risk Revisited, most of those protected areas aren’t being effectively managed. Much of our work is focused on helping communities develop successful management programs so they can create and enforce local regulations that will really benefit their coral reefs. And the first step is often to design a management plan. We’ve known for a long time that for a management plan to be successful, it has to be built around local resources, traditions, and customs. So naturally, our first step in working with a community is always to learn as much as we can about the area and really understand the dynamics and relationships. Next we help them gather and compile information about their environments, cultures, and lifestyles. This is what we’ve been doing in Bali, where communities have created seven marine protected areas on the north shore, all with significant management challenges. In Tulamben and Amed, both small fishing villages in Bali, we’re partnering with Lens of the Community of Indonesia (LMN) through the Photovoices program to help the local residents document their natural environments, cultures, traditions, and lifestyles through photos. When compiled, these photos tell powerful stories about how community members are interacting with nature and help identify issues and challenges that may affect management programs. Through the photos, we will be able to gain a better understanding of what’s happening to Tulamben’s and Amed’s natural resources, and help governments and local NGOs better prioritize conservation initiatives. The program and photos also help foster a sense of ownership over their environment, and often lead to more buy-in and support from local community members. Forty individuals—a nice mix of community members, local governments, and indigenous village representatives—are participating in a training which will run from April to August, 2015. By having such a diverse group of representatives who all play a role in protecting Bali’s natural environment, this program is helping to foster the conversations necessary to build support for conservation. Thank you LMN for leading this effort! And to the communities of Tulamben and Amed, snap away! We can’t wait to see the final photos when they are compiled into a photo book later this year.  "

        "content": "On September 8, 2021, it was officially announced that a comprehensive map and monitoring system of the world’s shallow water coral reefs, the , was completed. This tremendous effort was led by Arizona State University in collaboration with scientists, universities, private entities, and NGOs across the globe—including the Coral Reef Alliance. The tool is the first of its kind, using advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images to capture valuable information about the world’s coral reefs in depths of up to 15 meters. The Allen Coral Atlas was named in memory of Paul G. Allen, Microsoft co-founder, passionate diver, and philanthropist, who was committed to expanding our understanding of coral reefs and driving policies to protect them. Following his vision, the Atlas will provide marine conservationists and governments access to data about the location and health of coral reefs. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, has been involved with the project since its early days, and sees the value of this new technology and how it can contribute to reef conservation and management. “About three quarters of the world’s reefs have inadequate mapping and monitoring,” says Fox. “So this helps fill that data gap.” This scientific advance comes at a critical time in history—a time where we will determine the fate of the world’s coral reefs. Every year,  , along with   and an increasing number of coral bleaching events. In fact, scientists estimate that half of the world’s reef-building corals have already disappeared—impacting marine ecosystems and coastal communities alike. But this new technology has the potential to help put us on the right track. The maps serve multiple purposes, acting as a resource for marine spatial planning, aid for hurricane recovery, as well as data to analyze pollution and inform proposed policies for fishing regulations. It is also particularly useful when monitoring coral bleaching, a potentially deadly phenomenon that occurs when water temperatures become too warm and corals become stressed. So far, the Allen Coral Atlas is being used in more than 30 countries and for more than 50 conservation projects. It is free, accessible, and comes with online training tools and workshops. In places like Sri Lanka and the Philippines, the Atlas is already being used when establishing marine protected areas. “The right information and reliable updated data is very important in planning and decision making,” says Reynante Ramilo, a Program Coordinator for Community Centered Conservation in the Philippines. “The Atlas maps will enhance our work toward more efficient biophysical assessment of the marine habitats that, together with the community, we jointly aim to protect and manage through the establishment of marine protected areas.” As more conservation initiatives and locations utilize the Atlas, field scientists are continually ground truthing its accuracy. CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager   is a big part of that effort. Rivera-Sosa is working to bring together a collaborative, global network of field scientists who can verify coral bleaching events that satellites are detecting from space. As a technology, the Allen Coral Atlas provides an incredible opportunity for the conservation science community to collaborate together and work toward our shared goal to save coral reefs. At CORAL, we are optimistic that this tool will assist in our efforts to respond to coral bleaching and mitigate direct reef threats, like water pollution and overfishing. “Now that we’ve mapped the world’s shallow coral reefs, we’re moving on to new areas of innovation,” says Dr. Greg Asner, the Director of Allen Coral Atlas. “It’s our goal to support conservation, management, and policy around coral reefs for generations to come.”"

        "content": "From a conservation point of view, we don’t often think of coral reefs going hand in hand with construction and development. But they do—coral reefs attract tourists, and with tourism comes infrastructure. Coral reefs also provide benefits to communities, and people tend to concentrate in areas where they can reap those benefits. Over the years coral reefs along Maui’s West coast have fallen victim to this cycle. As more houses, hotels, roads, and other infrastructure projects are created, more and more rainwater runs off into the ocean, bringing with it nutrients and sediment that are harmful to the reefs. Earlier this summer we partnered with the Sustainable Living Institute of Maui (SLIM) to hold a six-week course for West Maui’s landscapers, landowners, and accommodations industry professionals to address this issue. The course taught them about various low impact design (LID) principles they could implement in landscape and construction projects to help reduce the amount of polluted water running off into the ocean during storms. LID uses the principles of nature to design landscape and development plans that preserve the natural function of a watershed. For example: If we work to restore the watershed to its natural state, we can divert stormwater from entering the ocean and help improve the water quality for coral reefs. Individuals from seven different properties attended and represented more than 100 acres of coastline. One participant came all the way from Lanai in order to learn more and bring LID principles back to his hotel, The Four Seasons, Lanai. In fact, we are proud to report that participants are taking action and each one developed a sustainability project that they are implementing on their property. “Through this course we invested in human resources and knowledge, and that goes really far,” says Wes Crile, CORAL’s Hawaiʻi-based program manager and coordinator of the course. “It’s one thing to build a rain garden for someone, it’s another thing to educate them on how to build it. We’re building a collaborative group of LID advocates who will now spread the word.” Coral reefs are a vital habitat for marine life, supporting nearly a quarter of all marine animals. By protecting them, we’re also protecting one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. But keeping coral reefs healthy isn’t just beneficial for the environment, it’s also beneficial for communities. Coral reefs are an important source of protein for more than one billion people worldwide—and they provide vital livelihoods for families. They also help protect the coastline from large storm waves. Hotels are also finding it’s in their best interest to protect them. In Hawaiʻi alone, reefs bring in more than $10 million in tourism revenue annually. Sustainable practices are no longer a trend, they are here to stay. More and more travelers seek to support businesses that help protect the environment. When hotels invest and take the time to educate their staff they help build a vital skill set and knowledge that gives employees an opportunity to talk about sustainability initiatives to their guests. Take the Kahana Sunset Condominiums—longtime resident and site manager, Jackie Scheibel, attended the course and she is helping to pave the way with a new public walkway that will provide easy beach access. She is actively using her new LID skills and will use big planters to filter stormwater as it comes off the road and place native plants along the hillside to help stabilize sediment. In addition, she will use pervious pavement so water will sink into the ground instead of running into the ocean. Just imagine what would happen if these LID practices were implemented across large coastal properties—we could potentially divert millions of gallons of stormwater from entering West Maui’s marine environment each year. Help CORAL and hotels such as The Four Seasons and Kahana Sunset continue this great work! Show your support and help provide a more secure future for the communities and industries that rely on coral reefs by ensuring reefs have the clear, nutrient-free water they need to survive.  "

A couple of month’s ago, I was talking with CORAL’s Program Manager from Hawaiʻi, Wes Crile, about how much we’d love to build a coastal bike path designed entirely with low impact design (LID) principles. Using LID principles like vegetated swales, pervious pavement, and rain gardens would help prevent runoff and sediment from entering the ocean—a big threat to Hawaiʻi’s coral reefs. Instead, it would filter and sink it deep into the ground, even recharging our aquifer. A bike path is perfect for this as it generally follows a contour line of the land, cutting across the watershed at a specific elevation. The path could act like a barrier for stormwater runoff coming down from above. Not long after this conversation, we started talking with the MBL, who were putting together plans to build a bike path along Maui’s west coast, from Olowalu to Lahaina. This area has some of the best reefs on the island, but right now they are heavily affected by sediment running off from the nearby  , or upslope, region and into the water during heavy rain events. This was a perfect opportunity for a partnership. The CORAL team is now collaborating with MBL to design plans for Hawaiʻi’s first ever LID bike path. In addition, we are working to secure funding and support. On June 29, Mayor Alan Arakawa came on a bike ride to see the area and provided suggestions on how to keep the project moving forward. I’m so excited about this project and am eager to forge ahead when we secure the necessary funds and permits to start construction. Stay tuned for more information about this project, and be sure to plan a trip to Hawaiʻi—you will want to ride along the new bike path once it’s completed!

When snorkelers or divers visit Namena, they proudly wear a round “poker chip” style tag on their gear, which they later take home with them as a treasured token of their time in Fiji. What many people don’t realize, however, is that this dive tag is much more than just a souvenir – it represents a great success story for community-based conservation. Namena is Fiji’s largest “no-take” Marine Protected Area (MPA) and forms part of the traditionally-owned fishing grounds ( ) of the Kubulau community. The dive tag program was born over 15 years ago when the Kubulau community approached CORAL for assistance in developing a sustainable management system that would protect Namena’s fisheries from overexploitation, while providing tangible benefits to the community. In 2003, CORAL helped the community launch a dive tag program, modeled off of a system used in Bonaire Marine Park in the Caribbean. The program uses fees from the purchase of dive tags to fund MPA management and community development, thereby increasing community “buy-in” for conservation and alleviating fishing pressure. CORAL assisted in funding and implementing the first Namena dive tag in 2003. Ever since then, Namena has been holding an annual Dive Tag Photo Competition in which individuals from around the world are invited to submit underwater photos from Namena. The winner of the competition has the unique privilege of having their photo featured on the Namena Dive Tags for the year. This summer, in the fifteenth year of the Photo Competition, photographer Lars Wahlquist won over the judges with his stunning photo of a   nudibranch. Today, both coral reefs and the Kubulau community reap the benefits of the voluntary dive tag program, in what is clearly a win-win for both communities and conservation. More than 1000 tags are purchased annually by visitors and Marine Recreation Providers at the price of FJ$30. The funds collected from the sale of the dive tags are used to conduct maintenance on moorings within the reserve, fund patrols for enforcement, and sustain a scholarship fund for students from Kubulau, which has already benefitted well over 200 students. Namena is now one of the most successful MPAs in Fiji, and its dive tag user fee system is upheld as a model for other community-managed MPAs throughout Fiji and the world. If you ever have the luck of diving in Namena, you can be proud that your dive tag purchase is making a meaningful contribution towards protecting coral reefs and supporting Fijian communities!"

Earlier this month, our team installed two weather stations in the Honokōwai and Wahikuli watersheds. Skye Instruments generously donated a weather station for each of the watersheds we are currently working on restoring in the Ka’anapali area of West Maui. These two weather stations will provide CORAL with information on local weather conditions including temperature, wind speed and direction, rainfall, soil moisture and– best of all – are all powered with solar panels.  The data generated by the weather stations will be remotely transmitted, allowing our Maui program to look at real-time weather conditions at our sites, plan watering schedules for native plants at our restoration sites based on local conditions and determine how these environmental factors are influencing the success of our restoration projects. The data will also help us analyze the amount of rain that triggers sediment to mobilize across the landscape and cause “brown water” occurrences in coastal waters. Brown water advisories are issued by the Department of Health of Hawaiʻi when heavy rains cause flood waters that contain chemical runoff, sediment pollution and waste from overflowing cesspools. Last year alone, there were 167 Brown Water Advisories issued in West Maui. These events are harmful to people and corals, as the pollution from stormwater travels downstream and eventually settles on coral reefs, where it causes coral degradation and death. Armed with the information from the new weather stations and the turbidity monitors installed near the mouth of Wahikuli and Honokōwai streams, CORAL will be able to investigate the correlation between rainfall, sediment accumulation at our restoration sites, stream turbidity and sediment accumulation on coral reefs.  As the native plants we have planted at our restoration sites become established and more erosion control practices are installed, we aim to show that more sediment will be retained on the land. Ultimately, our streams and reefs will be cleaner due to our restoration sites and monitoring programs,  and West Maui will have less brown water events in coastal waters, benefiting both people and coral reefs."

        "content": "COVID-19 has affected all of us in one way or another. Some people have lost loved ones or friends and neighbors to this pandemic. Some of us are now sheltering in place, unable to travel or do many other activities that we recently took for granted. We are all experiencing uncertainty about what the future holds. However you may be affected, we at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), continue to extend our heartfelt thoughts to all of you, our extended CORAL family. CORAL and our community partners have been working to rapidly change our work in response to COVID-related lockdowns. We wanted to take this opportunity to talk about how we are adapting our approach to coral conservation in the face of this pandemic. CORAL is on a mission to save the world’s coral reefs. We do this, in part, by working collaboratively with communities to reduce local stressors to reefs—like   and  . Key to our success are our local partner organizations. Over time, we have helped many local community groups grow into strong organizations that are largely self-sufficient. However, even the strongest organizations are now threatened by the ramification of the pandemic. To illustrate the challenges that our partners face, we are going to take you on a virtual trip to Honduras to see what life is currently like for our partner Roatán Marine Park, and how they are adapting to their new situation with CORAL right by their side. Roatán Marine Park (RMP) is one of the local organizations responsible for managing the Bay Islands National Marine Park, which at 650,000 hectares is Honduras’ largest marine protected area (MPA)  . One of the biggest threats to reefs in Honduras is overfishing—and indeed, overfishing thought to affect more than 55 percent of the world’s coral reefs. When people overharvest fish on a reef, whether for food or the aquarium trade, the entire food web is affected. On healthy reefs, seaweeds (also called macroalgae) are kept at low levels thanks to intense grazing by herbivorous fish, like parrotfish and surgeonfish. When these fish disappear, the delicate balance of the coral reef ecosystem is disrupted, and macroalgae can grow unchecked, smothering reefs and making it harder for corals to reproduce and for their larvae to settle. RMP is reducing overfishing by establishing sustainable fisheries policies and practices. These regulations mean little unless they are enforced, and so one of the key roles that RMP plays is conducting regularly law enforcement patrols. RMP is also building awareness among fishers about the detrimental impacts of overfishing to help them make different decisions. CORAL and RMP have been partners since 2005. CORAL’s team in Honduras helped build RMP’s financial and management systems, and have supported key positions at RMP. CORAL also financially supports their patrol operations, which enforce local fishing regulations up to eight hours a day, six days a week. As a result of our partnership, herbivorous and commercial fish biomass in Roatán has increased significantly.  COVID-19 has severely impacted the lives of the people of Honduras. On March 16th, the Honduran government closed its borders and required all of its 9.5 million citizens to remain at home. Tourism, once the principal source of income, has stopped. Organizations like RMP derive most of their revenue voluntary fees paid by scuba divers and products sold to tourists at their eco-stores. As RMP’s Executive Director Francis Lean says, “People who once depended on tourism for their livelihoods are turning to illegal fishing practices, which is creating an enormous pressure on the reef. Rangers are continuing their patrols for now but our ability to keep them up is uncertain.” While the pandemic has thrown a curveball at us, at CORAL we pride ourselves on our resilience and ability to discover innovative ways to support our community partners, like RMP. Our team in Honduras is working with the leaders at RMP to create plans to address this sudden reduction in income. They have come up with unique and creative ways to raise funds and drive traffic to their on-line eco-store. They are also looking at how to reduce expenses. To support them, CORAL is directly providing grants to support staff salaries at RMP and other organizations across the country. Additionally, we are also working with our generous funders to seek flexibility in how the grant monies will be spent so that they can be used to support ongoing operations. As of now, we are making headway with funding RMP’s programs but we have no idea how long borders will be closed nor how long tourists will stay away. “The spirit of collaboration has always been strong here in Honduras between CORAL and its partners. If anything, the coronavirus pandemic has strengthened our bonds and determination. We are banding together to overcome these new challenges. Our hopes are high, our minds are focused and our hearts are committed to getting through this together.” – Jenny Myton, CORAL’s Associate Program Director, Honduras.

The Coral Reef Alliance, or CORAL for short, has worked with communities in Fiji for over fifteen years to promote sustainable management systems for fisheries and corals. CORAL initially began working with the Kubalau community in Bua Province, as they established The Namena Marine Reserve, Fiji’s largest locally managed marine area. The Namena Marine Reserve is a top global dive site, and it also provides tangible benefits to the Kubalau community in the form of increased fish size and number of catches, as well as dive tag fees from tourists. The funds from the dive tag system cover management costs of the reserve, fund community infrastructure projects like bus shelters and have provided scholarships to over two-hundred students to date. The people of Oneata rely heavily on coral reefs to support local fishing grounds, and the community’s food security has been threatened by declining reef health and overfishing. Oneata is far from the main islands of Fiji, so there is little tourism revenue. The supply boat comes every few weeks, and while locals do grow their own cassava and vegetables they have to travel great distances to access other food markets. Fishing, therefore, is a vital source of food and income. The Oneata community reached out to CORAL and asked for help with their locally managed marine area, citing the success of the Namena Marine Reserve. Right now, CORAL is actively working with Oneata to strategize around the creation and implementation of sustainable fishing solutions that will ensure food security and decrease fishing pressure on coral reefs."

And the fishes that we see before, won’t be able to see that much nowadays.” Food security is especially concerning in Oneata, where the distance from the main Fijian islands limits access to food markets. Traditionally-owned fishing areas called iqoliqoli have been used for generations, but overfishing has dramatically decreased catch sizes and catch amounts. On a recent field visit to Oneata, the community requested the help of the Coral Reef Alliance to address overfishing concerns. Soko Ledua, the head of the local fishing group, is one of the community members who worries about the future of fishing in Oneata. For decades, fishermen have sought out the highly-prized sea cucumber, which can have a market value upwards of 50 US dollars each. But like the reefs, populations of sea cucumbers are declining. “Before, just in front here, we just catching (sea cucumbers) here, twenty, forty pieces per day. But here, let’s see, yesterday here we are catching only seven. If we keep on harvesting this one, maybe ten years left…” Last year, CORAL held a planning session and workshop with communities in Oneata to help identify challenges and successes with the current management efforts of their iqoliqoli. That meeting inspired a number of solutions that are specifically tailored to Oneata’s needs. For example, CORAL is working with the Ministry of Fisheries in Fiji to train the local fishing group and community on best practices for sustainable fishing. Fishermen will learn how to measure the appropriate catch size for different fish species, and will train to become fish wardens of the iqoliqoli, to better protect it from outside fishing pressure. CORAL is also establishing partnerships in Oneata to create aquaculture systems in exchange for strong community commitment to avoid overfishing in the marine reserve. One such system is a mollusk and lobster aquaculture pilot program, which will provide a source of food and livelihood for the community while the iqoliqoli recovers. This is the first time that CORAL is tackling aquaculture, and what we love most about this collaboration with Oneata is that the ideas were generated by members of the community. This project will be an important model for how to finance conservation on remote coral reefs that don’t have access to revenue from tourism, and will be scalable to other remote areas of Fiji.

Coral reefs and fish populations are intricately linked, and the decline of coral reef health in Fiji has jeopardized food security in Oneata, where a remote location means that local communities depend on fishing for both their food and income. CORAL is teaming up with local leaders in Oneata to create win-win plans that benefit both the community and conservation. This type of management structure enables families to maintain their livelihoods and, at the same time, builds sustainable resource systems that will last for generations. Implementing stronger regulations against overfishing, teaching community members about sustainable alternatives and protecting coral reefs in and around the local fishing grounds will ensure that the people of Oneata safeguard their own future as well as the future of nearby ecosystems. CORAL has a long history of working with communities in Fiji to protect coral reefs and the people who rely on them. We know that people and reefs depend on each other, and we’re working in Fiji and a number of other places across the globe to unite communities to save coral reefs. But we can’t do it alone; we need your help. Right now, we have the local support necessary to develop durable solutions that can exist well into the future.

        "content": "In early March, 2018, communities in Amed and Tulamben held coastal cleanups to show their support for the third International Year of the Reef (IYOR). Local communities, Reef Check Foundation Indonesia (RCFI), and the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) encouraged youth participation as part of the event. The cleanups helped stakeholders share information about the impacts of marine debris on marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs, which support numerous living organisms. In these communities, coral reefs are the foundation of the local economy. On Sunday, March 4, 2018, Rare Tulamben, a youth group in Tulamben village, conducted a coastal cleanup in their neighborhood and along a stretch of beach. In the past, Rare Tulamben held coastal cleanups every Sunday morning, but the volcanic activity of Mount Agung, which led to community evacuations late last year, reduced the frequency and consistency of these cleanups. The community plans to continue these weekly activities as soon as Mount Agung’s volcanic activity decreases. Rare Tulamben is supported by TPST-Tulamben, a local trash management agency. I Nyoman Suastika, one of the local leaders working with Rare Tulamben, said that the involvement of youth in this kind of activity helps build their awareness of the environment at an early age. Suastika added, “Children usually do cleanups around this area. By doing this, we hope these activities will not only be useful for the children, but also the surrounding community in the future.” Participants of the Tulamben cleanup collected 110 kg (242 lbs.) of garbage, which was dominated by plastic. In addition, participants found Styrofoam, cigarette butts and fishing gear.  I Gusti Ayu Lakshmi from the RCFI explained that the cleanup was part of the preliminary data collection that can inform future trash management awareness campaigns. Lakshmi shared that she hopes more parties will participate in the future to help encourage waste management at the local level. The Amed coastal cleanup took place on March 3, 2018 and concentrated on Jemeluk Beach. Participants included youth, representatives of the fishermen community Tunas Mekar, photography community Klik Amed, the waste management non-profit Yayasan Peduli Alam, dive operators and members from adjacent communities. Participants walked approximately six hundred meters on Jemeluk Beach and collected a total of 120 kg (264 lbs.) of garbage. Most of the waste collected during the Amed coastal cleanup was plastic. Common forms included shopping bags, food wrappers, bottles and straws. Styrofoam comprised the second most common type of trash, followed by fishing gear, which included pieces of nets, fishing line and rope. I Nengah Polos, a representative of the Klik Amed community, said that “garbage on the beach is usually more common in the rainy season because additional trash is brought by both ocean currents and water flowing from the higher ground. Therefore, this kind of activity should be routinely implemented in addition to reducing sources of waste.”"

The CORAL Prize is a unique opportunity to recognize the people that are truly making a difference in the future of coral reefs, and applicants are nominated by a member of their community for their achievements and dedication. This year, we are honored to present Komeno Roberto Jean Luc (Roberto) as our 2018 CORAL Conservation Prize winner. Roberto grew up in Atsimo Andrefana, (Southwest) Madagascar, an area struck by immense poverty but surrounded by some of the most beautiful and diverse coral reefs. Roberto’s dedication to coral reefs and his community has been proven time and time again through his work as Head Scientific Advisor at Reef Doctor, a UK-based non-profit conservation and social development organization, and over his 18 years at the Institute of Fisheries and Marine Sciences in Toliara Madagascar. Roberto leads Reef Doctor’s diverse conservation and development projects including; aquaculture, reef restoration, marine reserve management, and research. He is one of only of 4% of the population of Atsimo Andrefana to obtain a university education; he holds a Masters in Applied Oceanography from the University of Toliara and a degree in Natural Sciences from the University of Antananarivo. Roberto has worked on a wide range of conservation efforts including monitoring coral bleaching, managing and developing marine protected areas and protecting and monitoring seagrass. His research yields important science-based information for all partners and has pioneering new techniques and pushed the boundaries of development and coral research in Madagascar. Roberto is both an integral member of the reef conservation community and an outstanding leader in his community. Atsimo Andrefana is a rural area where over 70% of the population has received less than 4 years of education and 88% of the population is identified as living in either severe or acute poverty, according to an Alkire and Santos Multidimensional Poverty Index assessment. Through his work at Reef Doctor, Roberto has worked closely with the local fishing communities to provide the skills and tools to the local community to protect and manage their marine and terrestrial ecosystems and support the livelihood of around 200,000 rural fishers threatened by declining fishery yields and degraded marine habitats. This, in turn, improves the well being of the impoverished rural communities as well as the natural environment and resources they depend upon, which are largely threatened by degradation and over-exploitation. Roberto’s commitment to leadership in both coral reef conservation and within his community has helped save coral reefs in Madagascar and serves as an inspiration to all who love and depend on coral reefs."

        "content": "In 2016, CORAL began an exciting new partnership with the Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL) at Stanford University. Three key players met to kickstart this collaboration: Dr. Michael Webster, CORAL’s Executive Director, Dr. Jeremy Bailenson, VHIL’s Director, and Dr. Robert Richmond, Director of the University of Hawaiʻi’s Kewalo Marine Laboratory. Although they didn’t know it at the time, their meeting would lead to one of the most popular virtual reality films presented at Tribeca. Their discussion centered around one key question:   The answer became clear when Dr. Richmond, who is also a CORAL Board member, suggested that VHIL staff attend a Palauan congressional meeting to show leaders how their coral reefs looked in virtual reality. This meeting would provide decision-makers and leaders with an immersive opportunity to learn more about coral reefs, their importance, and the threats they face. And then, hopefully, to positively influence the trajectory of future laws and regulations affecting coral reefs and coral reef conservation. With CORAL’s help, two VHIL staff members – Tobin Asher and Elise Ogle – traveled to Palau to film underwater virtual reality footage. Asher and Ogle’s visit coincided not only with the congressional meeting but also with a Stanford University Overseas Seminar, taught by Dr. Robert Dunbar and Dr. Stephen Monismith of Stanford University and Dr. Richmond. Asher and Ogle were able to join Stanford students and staff from the Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC) on daily field expeditions and filmed a diverse selection of both healthy and degraded reefs. The congressional meeting took place on July 7, 2017, at PICRC; Palauan delegates and senators attended the event, PICRC staff moderated the event and Dr. Richmond and Dr. Dunbar gave presentations on coral reef conservation and management. The goal of the meeting was to connect decision-makers and scientists and to facilitate understanding of how climate change and local stressors are affecting coral reefs in Palau and the people who depend on them. After the presentations, Asher and Ogle ran personalized demonstrations of virtual underwater footage from Palauan reefs. Many congressional members had never experienced VR technology before, and for some senators, it was their first time seeing an underwater landscape of coral reefs. An especially impactful underwater scene showed a popular snorkeling site, with tourists inadvertently kicking corals on the reef. Experiencing coral reefs in virtual reality and seeing the threats they face helped attendees understand the importance of protecting coral reefs, especially the popular tourist sites. Soon after the experience, Palauan senators introduced initiatives that would reduce the number of people at popular tourist sites and also made commitments to further research to protect coral reefs. The collaboration between the VHIL and CORAL didn’t end after the landmark congressional meeting. Asher and Ogle attended the 2017 CORAL Prize event last September and led individual immersive experiences for attendees. CORAL staff experienced bustling Palauan coral reefs and saw the power of virtual reality for conservation. VHIL staff also used the virtual reality footage from Palau to create  , an underwater VR film that was showcased at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2018. The film was a breakout star at the festival, garnering praise like “the best… virtual reality experience on offer at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival” from Observer Magazine. The film’s upbeat message helped connect viewers to coral reefs, and its interactive nature contributed to its success. As underwater filmmaker Ogle points out, “When you put the headset on and you feel immersed, that’s really what drives this experience as far as creating attitude and behavior changes for coral reefs.” The VHIL team is now working to bring   to popular Virtual Reality platforms, like SteamVR, Oculus and VIVEPORT. The film is available on Oculus  . Asher believes the message of hope was critical to the film’s impactful debut. “One of the things that was important to us was that it wasn’t a doom and gloom story. We wanted to emphasize that there are things people can do to combat what’s happening, and if we take action we can see positive results for coral reefs.”"

        "content": "Over the past few years, there’s been a steady increase and interest in a number of coral conservation activities that fall into the broad category of restoration. These include coral gardening, breeding corals in tanks and transplanting them onto reefs and growing corals on artificial reef structures in the water. At the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), we frequently get asked questions about restoration activities, so we thought we’d take a moment to explain some of the more common techniques, their potential benefits and disadvantages, and how CORAL is approaching restoration. One of the most common approaches to restoration is to place artificial reef structures on the ocean floor on which corals can grow. In some cases—for example, when natural reefs have been bombed for fish or mined for building materials—this approach may be an essential tool for rebuilding reefs. This is the case in several locations in North Bali, Indonesia, where many of the natural reefs are severely degraded. In response, communities are installing a variety of rebar and concrete structures on the seafloor to provide a place for baby corals to settle and grow. Unfortunately, deployment of these materials is haphazard, and sometimes, when they aren’t properly affixed to the seafloor, these structures become dislodged in storms and turn into wrecking balls, damaging natural reefs. At the request of these communities, CORAL is launching a new project that involves in-water testing of three common restoration materials. Our goals are to identify which approaches are best for rebuilding reefs and use this information to improve coral restoration techniques in North Bali and beyond. Another popular restoration technique is to grow corals in aquaria and out-plant them onto natural or artificial reefs. However, there remain a lot of questions about whether this and similar approaches are scalable due to their high implementation costs. If the goal of restoration is to repopulate degraded reefs, it’s likely that lots and lots and lots of corals will need to be out-planted to have a positive impact on the natural ecosystem. For example, we estimate that there are billions individual coral colonies in the Mesoamerican Reef, which spans over 600 miles of coastline from Mexico to Honduras. How many corals would need to be grown and out-planted to impact this ecosystem? Ten thousand or ten million? To answer this and similar questions, we launched a partnership with The Nature Conservancy’s Caribbean program this past summer. Using a mathematical model that we have developed with partners at the University of Washington and Rutgers University, we will estimate how many corals, planted with what frequency and in what locations relative to predominant ocean currents, are going to be required to positively impact coral reefs. We will use results from this model to develop “rules of thumb” for restoration practices that will help the conservation community evaluate the return on investment for restoration activities. A third approach to restoration is to select or genetically engineer corals that have particular traits—such as the ability to thrive in hot water—breed these corals in lab aquaria and out-plant them onto reefs. While this may seem like a good idea (the world is getting warmer, after all!), there is a very real risk that these approaches could compromise a reef’s genetic diversity. The inherent genetic diversity in coral reef ecosystems means that some individual corals thrive in warmer water and some do better in cooler water. Even as the average global temperature gets warmer, there will be variability about that average. If we saturate a reef with only corals that thrive in hot water, what happens if our predictions for a particular site are wrong and it cools? Or what happens if the engineered corals are particularly susceptible to a disease that strikes the reef? Basically, by engineering a solution and artificially selecting corals for unknown future conditions, we are putting all our eggs in one basket with potentially disastrous consequences. In the end, for these and other restoration techniques to be successful, they must also include effective conservation and management to the address the local stressors that led to reef decline in the first place. Without improving water quality, reducing over-fishing and stopping destructive practices, no reefs—natural or artificial, grown in an aquarium or in the ocean—have much chance of surviving. In this way, restoration can be thought of as one tool in a tool belt; let’s just remember you can’t build a house with only a hammer. That’s why at CORAL, we take a holistic approach to conservation that combines community-driven conservation with cutting edge science. We work with communities to reduce local threats to reefs and improve livelihoods, creating win-wins for reefs and people. We choose locations for our efforts that are connected to each other by the movement of baby corals. The resulting networks are places where corals can adapt to climate change through natural processes. We call these networks Adaptive Reefscapes. Simultaneously, we are advancing conservation science by testing and refining approaches to saving coral reefs. Our work on restoration is aimed at improving our understanding of how restoration activities can be most effective; by sharing this information, we can improve restoration globally."

        "content": "Coral reefs have been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons: island construction projects that are burying reefs, El Niño causing coral bleaching, and the risk to corals from carbon pollution. So it was unwelcomed news when we learned in October about a new study,  , that shows a common ingredient in sunscreen, oxybenzone, is bad for corals. Even at very low concentrations, the growth rate of baby corals exposed to oxybenzone slowed down and they became deformed. When the concentration was increased, baby corals bleached, which caused them to release their food-generating  . Scientists are just starting to understand how chemicals like sunscreens can harm corals. The current study is an important step forward, but we expect to learn more about the effects of oxybenzone on corals in the years to come. We will also learn about how a myriad of chemicals are interacting to create a potentially toxic soup for corals. In the meantime, we know enough to take action. Oxybenzone is demonstrably bad for corals and we need to limit its concentration in coastal waters. Corals are as important to the reefs as trees are to the forest: they build the habitat for all of the other life that calls the reef home. But by knowing that this risk exists for corals, we view this as an opportunity to do something small to help: when you’re visiting coral reef areas, don’t lather up with sunscreen, instead cover up for corals. Everyone can take one or more of these simple steps: As an added benefit, covering up just might be good for you, too. In addition to harming corals and other animals, scientists have identified oxybenzone as an endocrine disruptor with estrogenic effects (acting similarly to estrogen in our bodies) by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) ( ) and the International Chemical Secretariat ( ). When covering up is not an option, there may be some sunscreens that are less harmful to corals. In particular, research indicates that nonchemical, mineral-based sunscreens are best (such as top   ranked  ,  , and   sunscreens). Corals face many stressors that put the entire reef ecosystem at risk. Finding solutions for corals is important for the many species that call the reef home. It’s also important to the millions of people around the world who rely on coral reefs to provide food, protect shorelines from damaging storms and sea level rise, and to create economic opportunities through tourism. The good news is that many places are already working to help keep corals healthy by maintaining thriving fish populations and reducing coastal water pollution. If we can reduce harmful sunscreens from the coastal environment, we can give corals a little more breathing room to adapt to a changing world."

Around the world water pollution from land-based sources is killing our reefs—from cesspools and sewage pollution to contaminated runoff and pollutants. —on Hawai‘i Island, the small, but strong community in Puakō is setting out to change the trajectory for its coral reefs and, could set a precedence for community wastewater treatment state-wide. Puakō Reef is one of the most significant reefs in the main Hawaiian Islands. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated the South Kohala region, including Puakō, as a Coral Priority Management Site through its Habitat Blueprint initiative. The Puakō community, alarmed by the changes to their reef, reached out to local scientists and the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) to evaluate the causes and find solutions on how to restore reef health. A key challenge for wastewater treatment in Puakō is the proximity of residential properties to the shoreline, combined with the geology—very porous volcanic rock and high groundwater. This means that any polluted water released from residential treatment units can make its way to the reefs. Studies of this reef reveal that high levels of nutrients, bacteria, chemicals and pathogens enter the ocean from local cesspools. The overabundance of nutrients upsets the delicate balance of corals and causes an increase in algae and a loss of coral cover. On February 1, CORAL and the Puakō community reached a   with the release of a comprehensive   that supports the   project.

        "content": "Biologists talk a lot about biodiversity (aka biological diversity). But what does this really mean? Biodiversity refers to the variety of life. When biodiversity is high, it means there are many different types of organisms and species. Coral reefs have very high biodiversity—more than 25 percent of all marine species are found on coral reefs, which occupy less than one percent of the ocean. And every organism plays a unique role and contributes to how coral reef communities survive and function. When scientists lament the loss of biodiversity, they are not only saying that the number of species has changed on a reef or in a region, but that there may also be changes in how that reef functions. Coral reef species exist in a delicate balance of roles and responsibilities. The herbivores graze and keep algae growth in check. The predators keep the populations of herbivores and weak or injured fish in balance. Parrotfish munch on coral and emit the sand that many tiny creatures live in and on. Cleaner shrimp and fish remove parasites to keep many species healthy and thriving. The pink lacquer of crustose coralline algae releases chemicals that signal to larval coral there is a good place to settle. Each species has a role, and when that role is lost or threatened, the impact can cascade across other groups. High biodiversity ensures the health of the reef. It spreads those roles across many species, so if one species is affected by a disease or other threat, that role won’t be lost on the reef. Biodiversity also benefits humans. Many medical advances have come from coral reef species, and there are still an estimated   species yet to be described. We can only imagine what might be discovered next, from new species to new medical advances."

It was my fourth visit to Fiji since my first in 1980, and as I stepped off the jet, I was again welcomed by a chorus of island birds drifting my way on a warm tropical breeze. Fiji is a land of song, gentle people, and warmth above and below. I knew this was just the start of so much more to come.   On this live-aboard trip, I spent ten days on the Nai’a with 17 people from around the globe, cruising and diving Fiji’s Bligh Waters. Our itinerary included a return to one of my favorite dive destinations on the planet—the Namena Marine Reserve. Five years ago I made a day trip to Namena’s amazing reefs, diving twice among its brilliantly colored soft corals and huge schools of fish. This time, I was looking forward to several days’ of diving, to really explore Namena’s wonders. There were many memorable moments on the trip. One I will never forget was on the way to Namena when we twice dove the Nigali Passage near Gau Island. You descend just when a strong, tidal current whisks you along a natural amphitheater at 60-90 feet where sharks greet you with outstretched fins. About five minutes into each dive we came upon 25 to 30 gray reef and white tip sharks who were slowly swimming against the current, making lazy circles as they traveled along. It felt so natural, if not a bit surreal, to swim freely amongst them on their daily passage, as compared to a baited shark dive. Instead of watching the show from a sheltered ledge on one of the amphitheater walls, aptly named “the bleachers,” I opted to swim freely, and as our paths crossed, I got an up-close and personal experience with these predators. If the sharks were not enough, the amphitheater empties into two shallow gardens of brilliant corals that are home to hundreds of species of fish. A few days later we reached Namena. We were fortunate to have Didi Dulunaqio, Program Coordinator at the Coral Reef Alliance, come aboard to join us for a meal and inspire us with his personal narrative about the grass-roots creation and success of the Namena Marine Reserve. Didi is a heroic figure throughout dive circles in Fiji. He continues to work with the Kubulau Resource Management Committee and districts to protect and sustain Namena’s reefs and strengthen the partnership forged between CORAL, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the villagers of Kubulau. Namena was spectacular in 2010, but what I saw on this visit was a noticeable step up. If I had to guess, five more years of conservation has yielded a 20 percent increase in the abundance of fish and the density of the corals. We swam among impossibly large schools of trevally, yellowtail, snappers and pelagics, and thousands of golden, orange and pink anthias colored every dive. To see one enormous Napoleon wrasse on a dive is a treat; how about six together? And while catching a glimpse of a pygmy seahorse camouflaged in coral is not atypical on a multi-day dive trip, how about settling in with two pregnant pygmies free swimming back and forth between their perches? Or surfacing from a fantastic dive, only to jump into the water again to free swim for twenty minutes among a school of five manta rays – they seemed just as interested in showing off for us as we were in swimming with them. I’ve been diving on coral reefs since I was 10-years-old. Times are tough for corals, including on some of Fiji’s reefs. But this return to Namena and the Bligh Waters gave me a great deal of hope. It’s evident that when communities unite to save their coral reefs and forge alliances with organizations like CORAL, who have the experience and expertise to help them help themselves, the results can be spectacular. And success in one location has a domino effect on nearby communities who soon want to follow the formula and sustain their reefs. My return to the coral gardens of Namena left me thankful and proud of what collaborative conservation can, and will, accomplish for coral reefs around the world.  "

This stems not only from my personal love of nature but from my belief that all life is interrelated, a belief that drives my work with the Coral Reef Alliance. I learned this early through the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant that explains how life began, our shared genealogy. The ancient chant is more than two thousand lines, practiced, learned and shared over generations. The Kumulipo begins with cosmic darkness. At the time when the earth became hot At the time when the heavens turned about At the time when the sun was darkened To cause the moon to shine The time of the rise of the Pleiades The slime, this was the source of the earth The source of the darkness that made darkness The source of the night that made night The intense darkness, the deep darkness Darkness of the sun, darkness of the night Nothing but night The night gave birth Born was Kumulipo in the night, a male Born was Po‘ele in the night, a female The Kumulipo tells us that the Ko’a, or coral polyp, was the first organism created. The Ko’a was followed by seastars, cucumbers, and urchins, each increasing in complexity. Early translators of the chant noted that the order of species closely matches the biological groupings we use today. Born was the starfish, his child the small starfish came forth Born was the sea cucumber, his child the small sea cucumber came forth Born was the sea urchin, the sea urchin [tribe] The chant teaches us that life in the sea and life on land are inexorably connected, and what we do on land has a direct connection and impact on all organisms in the sea. Hawaiians recognize that these organisms are the building blocks for all life on this shared planet we call Honua. There is a resurgence of interest in the chant as people look for the traditional knowledge of ecological connections. The Kumulipo is always in the background of people’s minds. Born was the tough seagrass living in the sea Guarded by the tough landgrass living on land It is our   (responsibility) to preserve and protect all living organisms because we all come from the same primordial beginnings– ­from the night, from the slime, from the coral polyp. These lessons of the Kumulipo are deeply integrated into our consciousness. It’s something we feel in our  (deep within our being). We are all related, part of one   (family), and it is our responsibility to care for the land under our feet, the sea around us, and our coral reefs.

The Roatan Marine Park (RMP) in Honduras is an inspiring example of how conservation efforts lead to great things. The success and growth they’ve shown are tremendous. Last year, CORAL invested in the sustainability of RMP with a $12,000 grant to hire a sustainable finance coordinator. The new position was designed to help them diversify income streams and build relationships within the private sector. The goal was to increase their capacity so they can expand to new areas of the island and continue to protect Roatan’s unique natural beauty. With the new coordinator, the RMP has grown its membership base by 40 percent—they’ve built stronger relationships with donors, businesses, and community members. They also helped create a U.S. 501(c)3, which allows them to fundraise in the United States. “A lot of visitors come here and want to make a tax-deductible donation to the park,” says Jenny Myton, CORAL’s associate programs director based in Honduras. “This new 501(c)3 makes that possible.” As a result of the coordinator’s hard work, the RMP just received a $100,000 donation from a popular clothing brand. The unrestricted donation will support the sustainable finance coordinator position for the next four years and will help pay for necessary marine management, patrols and community development projects. “The RMP is reaching a new level of independence,” says Myton. “It’s exciting to see that CORAL’s initial investment is paying off. Communities can finance their conservation efforts, and we can use this example as a blueprint for other communities around the world.”"

Launched in 2012 with a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, RTI’s goal was to understand how multiple factors—for example, wave energy, herbivores, and the distribution of coral species on a reef—interact to affect the health of a coral reef. In conjunction with our scientific research, we worked with coral reef managers around the world to understand how they use science to inform their management decisions. We based our scientific research on the remote atoll of Palmyra in the central Pacific. Armed with cameras, clipboards, settlement tiles, temperature data loggers and more, we collected a truly staggering amount of biological, physical, and ecological data. Simultaneously, we worked with communities around the world—including partners in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Palau—to make sure that our scientific work was relevant to conservation and management challenges. Now that we have completed RTI, I wanted to share some of our key findings: We have combined these and other findings into a mathematical model that allows us to explore how climate change might affect reef health by increasing the frequency and intensity of disturbance events. If we know how healthy reefs, like those at Palmyra, can withstand change and recover from disturbance, we may be able to unlock the key to this resilience for other reefs around the globe. While funding for RTI has ended, our collaborative work will continue for years to come as we build on what we have learned from Palmyra and our work with communities around the world."

At first, I think—or maybe it’s hope—that the white patches are boulders or cresting wavelets. But as the plane flies on, their true identity becomes undeniably clear: these are bleached corals. And there are a lot of them. As   taken by researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies makes clear, the GBR is in trouble. Reports indicate that up to 93 percent of corals in the northern part of the reef have bleached. But it’s not just the GBR that’s reporting bleaching: corals in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean, north and south Pacific, and coral triangle are all turning bone-white. What does it mean to say that a coral is bleached? Corals get their colors from tiny algae that live within their tissues. These algae help corals grow by capturing energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. When waters get too warm for too long, these algae go into overdrive and their ramped up metabolism creates a toxic environment for corals. In response, the algae get kicked out, and the corals lose their color. Bleached corals aren’t necessarily dead corals, but the longer the bleaching continues, the lower the chance is that the corals will be able to recover. The current bleaching in the GBR is part of the third recorded global bleaching event. It’s the result of a particularly strong   occurring on top of already elevated global temperatures. Any single event is worrisome, but scientists are seeing an increase in the frequency of bleaching events. This means that corals don’t have the time they need to recover, and this has many people very worried. Only time will tell us how many—or how few—corals will survive this latest event. I had been reading reports of bleaching from around the world for months before I saw that video, so I should have known what to expect. But those thousands of words had not prepared me for a minute-long video. Those of us in conservation like to joke that we are trying really hard to put ourselves out of work. How great would it be if coral reefs no longer needed our help? I have never been so saddened by job security than when I saw all those bleached corals. We have a lot of work still to do. So what can we do? We can reduce local threats to reefs—such as overfishing and water pollution—so that reefs have ‘breathing room’ to recover from disturbances like bleaching. We can urge our politicians to take action on climate change. And we can find ways to support the many communities around the world that are working to protect coral reefs, one of the most wondrous ecosystems on earth."

They live in warm waters at 2-40 meters deep in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and can grow up to 12 inches (31 cm) long. Blue Tang are one of more than 70 species of surgeonfish, a group of fish known for the very sharp spines near the tail. They normally hold these spines close to their body, but they can extend them when threatened. When they are young, they feed exclusively on plankton. As adults they are omnivores, eating both algae and invertebrates, including plankton. Royal Blue tangs play an important role in maintaining the health and balance of coral reefs. Herbivores graze the algae (seaweed) on reefs, similar to cattle or sheep in a field. These herbivores keep the algae in check and keep space open for corals to grown and settle. Without herbivores, algae can overgrow and crowd out corals. Coral reef structure is important to blue tangs who hide in coral branches, crevices and holes to avoid predators like groupers, bar jacks and tuna. Despite how endearing Dory might appear in the movies, the real blue tangs do not make good pets because they need large tanks (which are expensive), a carefully balanced diet, and they are susceptible to disease—therefore they need very experienced aquarists to take care of them. Because this species cannot be bred in captivity, they are currently collected from coral reefs and there is concern that increased demand as a result of  will put too much pressure on wild populations. For all these reasons, this species is better left on a reef or enjoyed at a responsible public aquarium."

        "content": "Coral reefs around the world are being hit hard by many stressors. At the local level, they’re dealing with issues like overfishing and poor water quality. At the global level, they’re facing warming temperatures, more acidic oceans, and stronger storms. With effective management, we can mitigate many local threats. But the global ones are a bit harder. It’s clear that if corals are going to survive global climate change, they are going to have to adapt. The good news is that we know that corals can adapt. They have evolved numerous ways to deal with environmental conditions – for example, some corals thrive in murky river mouths while others flourish in warm-water lagoons. But the pace of climate change is rapid, leaving corals with a small window in which to adjust to rapidly changing conditions. So what can we do to help corals adapt? This was the topic of one of Monday’s sessions at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS). Lead by our very own Dr. Madhavi Colton, the session brought together experts in coral reef biology, genetics, and ecology to answer this very question. Many of the talks in this session focused on assisted evolution—that is, speeding up evolution through direct management. For example, one speaker shared her work creating hybrid corals—similar to work being done to create hybrid tomatoes. If you breed the sperm from one species of coral with the egg from another, can you create a coral that will do better under future conditions? Dr. Adrian Stier of the University of Washington called these predict-and-prescribe approaches. Predict-and-prescribe approaches place bets about what future conditions will look like and which corals will do better under these conditions. If those predictions are correct, then these strategies can be incredibly effective. But according to Stier, they are also inherently risky because they are focused on a few species or genes. What if those bets are wrong? We risk losing the very diversity from which climate change winners could naturally emerge. Instead, Stier advocated following Warren Buffet’s example. Financial markets are like ecosystems in that they are inherently unpredictable (despite what your financial manager might have told you!). In the face of this uncertain future, a smart investment decision is to hedge your bets and diversify your portfolio. Through diverse investments, you are less likely to lose everything and more likely to consistently gets better returns. We can do the same for coral reefs, Stier said. Instead of investing all of our efforts into creating corals of the future, we can protect diverse portfolios of options. We can let nature pick the winners. As one member of the audience stated, if we focus our efforts on reducing local threats—many local threats, not just one or two—and building marine protected areas that are connected to each other, we’ll have a better chance of corals adapting to future environmental changes."

        "content": "For many years, few people paid attention to the impacts that poor water quality has on coral reefs. But this is changing. At the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), many sessions focused on discussing this important issue. Never has the CORAL team been so excited to hear so many talks on sewage, sedimentation, and runoff! Poor water quality impacts most of the reefs around the world. When polluted water enters the ocean, it carries both sediment and nutrients. Sediment can smother a reef, blocking out the sunlight that corals need in order to grow. Nutrients fuel the growth of algae and seaweeds which compete with corals for space. According to a talk by Stephanie Wear of The Nature Conservancy, high levels of nutrients can also lead to higher incidences of coral disease and bleaching. This is particularly relevant today when we’re in the middle of the third global bleaching event. But as Wear pointed out, our efforts to address reef threats are unbalanced: there is more focus on combatting overfishing than on addressing poor water quality. We know that to help corals deal with climate change, we need to reduce all local threats to reefs so that they have the ‘breathing room’ to adapt. However, poor water quality is a complicated issue to address. Often our water quality standards are designed with human health in mind, but this may not be enough to keep corals safe. Also, addressing poor water quality usually means heavy upfront capital investments in infrastructure, which can be a significant hurdle for many communities. The good news is that we know what we need to do. The first step is to help local communities understand the effects of land-based pollution on coral reefs. Dr. Tracy Wiegner’s project at the University of Hawai‘i is a great example of that. A partner with our   project, Wiegner, and her team have helped the Puakō community on Hawai‘i Island understand the effects of poor water quality on their local reef. Their study found that cesspools leak sewage into the nearshore environment in as little as six hours. According to Wiegner, there are 90,000 cesspools in the state of Hawaii, and 50,000 of those are on Hawai‘i Island. Hawai‘i is the last state in the US to ban cesspools, and the second to last state banned them 50 years ago. Work like that of Dr. Wiegner shows linkages between land and reefs, and can be instrumental in motivating communities to take action. The next step is to connect communities with the tools and resources they need to address water pollution. We’re already doing this on  , on  , and in  . With the amount of attention poor water quality received at ICRS this year, we’re optimistic that we will see an increase in global efforts to address these threats in the coming years."

        "content": "Overfishing is a widespread problem across our oceans. As our global human population quickly approaches eight billion, pressures on these ocean resources will only increase. That means bad news for coral reef fish. They are even more vulnerable to overfishing than pelagic (open ocean) fish because of their biology, said Dr. Charles Birkeland in his Tuesday morning plenary session at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS). Coral reef fish are slow growing and long-lived, and there’s ample evidence that older, bigger fish are more fertile and produce young that are better equipped to survive the larval phase. Coral reef fish play a vital role in the coral reef network of life. For example, herbivores, or grazing fish, eat algae and seaweeds and can prevent them from overgrowing corals on a reef. In this morning’s plenary address, Dr. Pete Mumby explained that coral larvae, or baby corals, are less likely to settle on a reef where algae is present. By keeping algae in check, herbivorous reef fish can facilitate coral recruitment and reef recovery. Coral reef fish are also the lifeline for many communities, providing an important source of food and income. That income can come directly from the sale of fish, and can also be generated by tourism (let’s be real, who doesn’t love to see reef fish while on a dive?). Combatting overfishing can therefore benefit communities in multiple ways. For example, one study from Palau quantified the value of sharks to tourism as compared to fisheries and found that sharks were much more valuable alive than dead. The same study found that tax revenue from scuba tourism was 24 times higher than the total revenue of the fishing industry. Birkeland suggested that communities will benefit by limiting reef fish to local markets rather than exporting them. In fact, Palau banned the export of coral reef fish, which has been great news for both reefs and the communities that rely on them. It’s no wonder that so many efforts focus on addressing overfishing on reefs. The stakes are high—500 million people rely on coral reefs. But is addressing overfishing alone really enough to save our coral reefs? Melanie McField from the Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI) says perhaps not in the Caribbean. In a new study of the Mesoamerican Reef region, McField found that the presence of algae on a reef did not correlate with the population of herbivores. External factors like poor water quality also contributed to reef decline. This means that protecting herbivores alone won’t save coral reefs: it’s important to combat overfishing in conjunction with cleaning up water quality, which is what we are doing in Honduras. This is a common thread at ICRS this year. As you’ve read over the last few days, it’s not enough to address a single threat in isolation. We need to take a holistic approach to addressing multiple local threats if coral reefs are going to adapt to the many global changes coming their way."

They negotiated the Paris Agreement—a global agreement on limiting global warming. It was a great example of setting ambitious policy to protect our natural resources. COP 21 has been a popular topic at this year’s International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), the theme of which is bridging science with policy. It’s an important topic—how can we build a stronger partnership between scientists and policy makers to protect coral reefs? For example, the parties at COP 21 vowed to pursue efforts to limit global warming to under 2.0 C; however, according to Dr. Janice Lough in this morning’s plenary session, a 1.5 C increase in temperatures would have drastic effects on coral reefs. Using data from a variety of sources, Dr. Lough showed that our Earth has already warmed by 1.0 C since the early 1800s. Given that we’ve just witnessed some of the worst coral bleaching in history and that we haven’t hit the 1.5 C mark yet, people are understandably worried. In this instance we definitely need to bridge the gap between science and policy—we need more scientists like Lough to stand up and say that a 2.0 C goal isn’t good enough, and we need policy makers who will listen and respond. There’s a piece missing to that though, and one that we can’t ignore. Local communities are the ones that depend on coral reefs and that will suffer the most if we lose our reefs. They aren’t the ones going to conferences like COP 21 though, and they aren’t always the ones conducting the scientific research. How do we make sure their voices are heard, and their resources are protected? How can we help these communities be strong and resilient in the face of these looming global shifts? We can do what we at CORAL do best—we can help them manage their natural resources. We can continue working in places like Fiji, where we’ve helped the Kubulau community autonomously manage the Namena Marine Reserve. We can continue supporting communities in Bali with their efforts building locally-managed marine protected areas (MPAs). We can continue working with our partners around the world to ensure communities benefit socially, financially and culturally from conservation. As numerous talks at ICRS have pointed out, strong management that effectively reduces local threats can buy corals the time they need to adapt to changing environmental conditions."

According to preliminary results from Dr. David Gill, many marine protected areas (MPAs) have inadequate staffing and financial resources for management activities and this could be affecting their ecological performance. Thankfully, at this year’s International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), we learned about various creative conservation financing mechanisms being developed and implemented around the world. Our favorite example is from   in Honduras (note: we may be a bit biased!). Jenny Myton, our Associate Programs Director for the Mesoamerican region, presented on their model this afternoon. In 2009 we helped RMP develop a business plan. From that plan, they’ve become 100% self-sustaining financially. They’ve created merchandise shops that bring in a third of their total revenue, and another third comes from the sale of voluntary dive tags. As you may have read in a previous blog post, in 2015 we gave RMP a $12,000 grant to hire a sustainable finance coordinator. They’ve since multiplied that amount astronomically, covering the costs of the position for the next several years as well as an expansion of marine park patrols to new areas. The example from RMP demonstrates that if we invest smartly and efficiently in building local management entities, we can help communities autonomously manage their resources in the long-term. Together, we can help empower communities to protect their coral reefs."

        "content": "In a natural landscape, trees and soil help soak up rainwater, but in developed or urban landscapes, rainwater falls onto streets, parking lots, roofs, or other non-absorbent surfaces like concrete and asphalt. Instead of sinking into the ground, rainwater runs off the land, picking up harmful pollutants like nutrients, pesticides, petroleum residues, and sediments along the way.  During heavy rains, the water that runs off the landscape is called stormwater. Eventually stormwater ends up in our oceans – either by traveling down storm drains or by flowing into waterways like rivers and streams that lead to the ocean. When polluted stormwater flows into the nearshore environment, it  . Nutrient pollution enables the overgrowth of algae which can kill corals by smothering them, blocking their access to sunlight and promoting coral disease. High levels of sediment runoff can also kill corals by suffocating them and blocking their access to sunlight. In Hawaiʻi, stormwater pollution is an island chain-wide problem. Because of our often steep topography and prevalence of altered landscapes (like concrete and deforested agricultural lands), most stormwater follows a quick path straight to the ocean. Large storm events in the islands can transfer so many pollutants into our coastal waters that the Department of Health has to issue “Brown Water Advisories” – warnings to the public that the water is potentially contaminated and poses a health threat to swimmers. A Brown Water Advisory is being issued for the island of Maui due to recent heavy rains. The public is advised to stay out of flood waters and storm water runoff due to possible overflowing cesspools, sewer manholes, pesticides, animal fecal matter, dead animals, pathogens, chemicals, and associated flood debris. Not all waters may be affected, however, if the water is brown stay out and continue to practice good personal hygiene. Follow up with your primary care physician if you have any health concerns.” Stormwater in Hawaiʻi not only poses a threat to coral reefs and human health but also negatively impacts the economy by causing a loss in revenue for the tourist industry. It causes a host of other environmental problems like polluting streams and denuding the land of important topsoil needed for agriculture. In West Maui, fallow agricultural lands and the design of dirt roads within these plantations has created easy pathways for sediment to travel to the ocean. Lack of ground cover, the slope of the land, and frequent heavy rains create perfect conditions to transport topsoil with all its contaminants down to coral reefs. In West Maui, CORAL’s   Initiative focuses on preventing sediment and nutrient pollution from reaching the ocean and degrading reefs.  We take a   (“ridge to reef”) approach to restore the natural function of a watershed to filter stormwater and absorb nutrients, sediments and other chemicals.  We work with farmers, Hawaiian communities, local nonprofits, private businesses, and the government to restore streams, which capture and stabilize sediments and nutrients so that they don’t flow into the ocean. We are piloting stream restoration techniques that combine modern technology with native vegetation and traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices. For example, we are planting deep-rooted vetiver grasses to help stabilize soil, absorb nutrients and pollutants, increase ground water infiltration, and improve the environment for successful replanting of native vegetation. When vetiver sediment traps are planted within dirt road “kickouts”, they can hold runoff from road segments, detaining water for long enough for sediments to soak into the soil, rather than flow into streams. These actions not only restore streams and prevent pollutants from entering the ocean, but they also lead to a whole host of benefits like restoring ecosystem services, improving habitat for species, and creating recreational opportunities for communities. If you live on Maui and are interested in playing a role in this important work,   You can help plant native plants, create sand bag corridors, and take part in other fun stream restoration activities! For more details, email Annalea Fink at maui@coral.org. You can also help reduce stormwater pollution and safeguard coral reefs year-round by reducing pesticide and chemical use in your yard, and/or by implementing low impact design (LID) solutions like   or   in your home or workplace.

For over 15 years, we have been working in West End, supporting and building the capacity of Roatán Marine Park (RMP), our long-time partners and co-managers of the Bay Islands National Marine Park. Nowhere is the success of our approach more evident than in the recent declaration of the Tela Bay Marine Wildlife Refuge. Thanks to the hard work of CORAL and partners, in early 2018 the Honduran national government approved the declaration of this new marine protected area, which covers 86,259 hectares of reefs and coastal ocean. Hiding in Tela Bay’s unassuming murky waters are some of the healthiest coral reefs in all of the Caribbean. Scientific surveys have shown that Tela Bay supports a staggering sixty-nine percent of live coral cover, which is more than three times the average coral cover in the Caribbean. The bay supports forty-six coral species, eighty-three fish species and eighteen types of marine habitats. It is also home to healthy populations of elkhorn and staghorn coral – a rare distinction given that these critically endangered species have declined by eighty percent over the past thirty years. The refuge will not only ensure the future of this stunning ecosystem, it will also enable the coral reefs to continue to provide food and economic opportunities to the thirteen coastal communities that live on its shores. As part of our efforts to protect the unique reefs of Tela Bay, CORAL also played a key role in the declaration of Honduras’ first coastal managed-access fishery in   – a lagoon near Tela Bay where juvenile reef fishes grow up.  This managed-access fishery creates an important model for fisheries reform in the southern MAR. We’re continuing our work with local partners to ensure protection of this marine treasure through projects that create win-wins for people and reefs, such as supporting alternative livelihoods to reduce unsustainable fishing in Tela Bay and the neighboring  Amid the often gloomy messages about the fate of coral reefs, we feel it’s important to acknowledge and celebrate the hard-earned conservation successes by dedicated communities of people who care deeply about the future of reefs – from non-profits and the dive community to governments and local fishing communities. We look forward to seeing what more we can accomplish together! En enero de 2018, compartimos los resultados del informe de Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI, La Iniciativa de Arrecifes Saludables, por sus siglas en inglés) sobre el estado y las tendencias de la salud de los arrecifes en el Arrecife Mesoamericano (SAM). Uno de los hallazgos clave del Reporte de HRI es que la dedicación y colaboración a largo plazo de grupos como CORAL en el Arrecife Mesoamericano (SAM) ha dado sus frutos, lo que ha llevado a mejoras directas y medibles en la salud del arrecife. A pesar de que los corales de todo el mundo se vieron muy afectados por el blanqueamiento masivo en los últimos años, 10 años de monitoreo de arrecifes por parte de HRI, en más de 300 sitios a lo largo de 1000 kilómetros y cuatro países, nos dicen que las cosas están mejorando en el SAM. La tendencia positiva se atribuye a un   y un aumento significativo de las , que ahora cubren el 57% del SAM. La protección legal y las acciones de gestión local, como las zonas prohibidas para la pesca, pueden conducir a un cambio medible y positivo en el número y tamaño de los peces. Y cuando los peces herbívoros (como el pez loro y el pez cirujano) prosperan, los arrecifes de coral se benefician porque estos peces se alimentan intensamente de algas marinas dañinas que compiten y pueden sobrepasar a los corales. Los   son alentadores por dos razones: primero, nos dice que hay acciones sencillas y concretas que podemos tomar para ayudar a los corales a adaptarse a los desafíos inmediatos en su entorno. En segundo lugar, nos dice que las estrategias que CORAL ha estado implementando en nuestros doce años de participación en el SAM son exactamente lo que hay que hacer.  . Llevamos más de 15 años trabajando en West End, apoyando y reforzando la capacidad del Parque Marino de Roatán (RMP), nuestros aliados de siempre y cogestores del Parque Nacional Marino de las Islas de la Bahía. En ninguna parte es más evidente el éxito de nuestro enfoque que en la reciente declaración del Refugio de Vida Silvestre Marina de la Bahía de Tela. Gracias al arduo trabajo de CORAL y sus aliados, a principios de 2018 el gobierno nacional hondureño aprobó la declaración de esta nueva área marina protegida, que abarca 86,259 hectáreas de arrecifes y océano costero. Escondidos en las modestas aguas turbias de la Bahía de Tela se encuentran algunos de los arrecifes de coral más saludables de todo el Caribe. Las investigaciones científicas han demostrado que la Bahía de Tela mantiene un asombroso sesenta y nueve por ciento de cobertura de coral vivo, lo que supone más de tres veces la cobertura media de coral en el Caribe. La bahía alberga cuarenta y seis especies de coral, ochenta y tres especies de peces y dieciocho tipos de hábitats marinos. También alberga poblaciones sanas de coral cuerno de alce y cuerno de ciervo, una distinción poco común dado que estas especies, en peligro crítico de extinción, han disminuido un ochenta por ciento en los últimos treinta años. El refugio no sólo garantizará el futuro de este impresionante ecosistema, sino que también permitirá que los arrecifes de coral sigan proporcionando alimentos y oportunidades económicas a las trece comunidades costeras que viven en sus orillas. Como parte de nuestros esfuerzos para proteger los arrecifes únicos de la Bahía de Tela, CORAL también desempeñó un papel clave en la declaración de la primera pesquería costera de acceso controlado en la  , una laguna cercana a la Bahía de Tela donde crecen los peces juveniles de los arrecifes. Esta pesquería de acceso controlado crea un modelo importante para la reforma pesquera en el sur del SAM. Seguimos trabajando con colaboradores locales para garantizar la protección de este tesoro marino a través de proyectos en los que la gente y los arrecifes salen ganando, como el apoyo a medios de vida alternativos para reducir la pesca insostenible en la bahía de Tela y la adyacente  A pesar de los mensajes a menudo desalentadores sobre el destino de los arrecifes de coral, creemos que es importante reconocer y celebrar los éxitos en materia de conservación conseguidos con mucho esfuerzo por comunidades de personas dedicadas que se preocupan profundamente por el futuro de los arrecifes, desde las organizaciones sin ánimo de lucro y la comunidad de buceadores hasta los gobiernos y las comunidades pesqueras locales. ¡Con gran expectativa esperamos ver qué más podemos lograr juntos!"

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented economic crisis across the globe—particularly in countries and regions that are highly dependent upon tourism revenue. In Honduras, for example, eight percent of the GDP comes from tourism. Spring break is one of their most popular travel periods when tourists from around the world flock to the Bay Islands on the Honduran Caribbean coast. The Bay Islands are a launching point to the world’s second-largest reef system—the Mesoamerican Reef—and the beautiful white sand beaches attract vacationers from around the globe. But this year, Easter week alone saw a loss of $283.4 million USD and nearly 30,000 jobs. The local communities who depend on that revenue and income felt the effects acutely. CORAL has partnered with local Bay Island communities since 2005 to build programs that reduce the impact of tourism on the reef and to ensure proceeds from tourism benefit communities and the environment. But perhaps even more importantly, we’ve helped the communities build programs that allow them to become resilient to setbacks, including COVID-19. When tourism suddenly came to an abrupt halt, CORAL and its local partners immediately got to work. We united with Go Blue Bay Islands and various tourism industry and government representatives to create a local committee that could help the region safely reopen its tourism economy. The popular committee soon expanded into a national committee and began addressing tourism safety across the country. Together the team created The Tourism Revitalization Plan*, which outlines biosecurity guidelines and best practices that provide a framework for restarting tourism responsibly and safely. “One of the greatest values of these guidelines is that they come from a joint approach that promotes inclusivity and applicability,” says Ms. Syntia Solomon, President of the Bay Islands Tourism Bureau and one of the founders of Go Blue Bay Islands. “Our destination and businesses must reopen, and we must restart domestic and international tourism responsibly and safely. To achieve this, all cross-sector businesses, regardless of size, must put in clear, sustainable and practical protocols.” The document has outlined protocols for businesses across sectors, like hotels, restaurants, tour operators, dive centers, rental car companies, beaches, gift shops and more. Some of the protocols are fairly familiar—like ensuring ease of access to hand-washing stations, requiring face masks, and encouraging social distancing. Others focus on ensuring employees and tourism operators are trained to recognize and address risks. And some outline clear response procedures for when an employee or community member tests positive. Just like coral reefs, when human communities are able to shift and adapt in times of crisis, they can stand strong—and even thrive—when faced with shocks and stresses. By listening to our local partners and acting based on their feedback, and by ensuring local communities have a united voice and the resources they need to weather periods of uncertainty, we can help the Bay Islands bounce back and reopen safely. “One of the most incredible things about the Bay Islands is our proximity the Mesoamerican Reef,” says Tanya Amaya, CORAL’s Program Manager in the Bay Islands. “Our economy is built around people coming from across the globe to experience its magic and enjoy our beautiful beaches. We’re hopeful that with these new protocols, we’ll be able to reopen the economy safely and begin welcoming visitors again.”  "

        "content": "As Executive Director of the Roatán Marine Park, Francis Lean can relate to her tourist clientele—she used to be one of them. Originally from Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, Lean used to join the 1.6 million people who visited Roatán on vacation each year. Roatán is one of the three main islands that make up the Bay Island chain on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. Its economy is highly dependent upon tourism, and travelers from around the world flock to the island to enjoy its beautiful white sand beaches and turquoise waters. The Roatán Marine Park (RMP) is one of 14 organizations that are responsible for day-to-day management of the resources within the Bay Islands National Marine Park, the largest marine protected area in Honduras. Like many businesses and organizations on the island, RMP is almost entirely reliant upon tourism—85% of its operating budget is tied to tourism, both directly and indirectly. So when COVID-19 led to widespread global lockdowns and a sudden halt in tourism, it hit the community and RMP like a ton of bricks. Overnight, their revenue plummeted. Their four gift shops, which typically account for nearly half of their revenue, no longer had any customers. Donations from tourists stopped coming. Hotels, restaurants and dive shops halted their sponsorships as they struggled to cover their own expenses. “We couldn’t believe it. It was very scary,” describes Lean. “Personally, I was very positive, thinking it would be over in a few days or a couple of weeks. But after a couple of weeks, I realized that we were going to have to make some tough decisions and prioritize.” The RMP team decided that maintaining their patrols was their top priority. “With everything that was happening, people were going to head to the ocean to get food,” says Lean. “We needed to make sure they did it sustainably.” As predicted, from April to June RMP saw a 150% increase in poaching compared to the same period last year. But paying for patrols meant they had to make cuts elsewhere. The non-patrol staff agreed to cut their hours and their salaries by 50%, and they closed all but one of their gift shops. Despite the hardships, Lean says RMP has been fairly resilient overall. She attributes much of that resilience to the relationships and collaborations they have in the community, which, she says, is largely a result of the support they have received from CORAL over the years. She highlighted their partnership with the Honduran Navy as an example, something CORAL helped establish. Every RMP patrol boat carries two members of the Navy to help with enforcement and safety. With five patrol boats, that’s at least ten Navy members per day. Typically, her staff would drive to another part of the island to pick up the Navy members from their base and bring them to the park office before each patrol. But with resources and time now a scarce commodity, community members have stepped up to house and feed Navy members locally and donate fuel for the patrol boats. RMP staff members also have taken to digital fundraising and marketing efforts. “We’re going digital,” says Lean. “We opened up a store online so now we can sell our products online, and we’re doing online fundraising also.” And with CORAL’s help, they have received a few grants to help cover some of their operating costs. CORAL has also created the Honduras COVID Reef Rescue Fund to solicit donations for RMP. Slowly, tourists are starting to return to the island. “People are feeling more positive now,” says Lean. “People are starting to work again and some of the dive shops are starting to get a small trickle of customers.” Looking forward, Lean knows they will be feeling the impacts of this downturn for years to come. But she’s confident in the organization’s ability to adapt and sees these past few months as an opportunity for the community and local businesses to reassess and reevaluate how they operate. At RMP, they are brainstorming new ways to diversify their revenue stream and are looking to secure more grant funding to make that happen. In the meantime, Lean encourages people to start following the Roatán Marine Park on social media and visit Roatán again. “The island is here waiting for you guys to come see it and take care of it,” pitches Lean. “This is the time to come to Roatán—the reef has taken a break from people, and that’s a good thing.”"

        "category": null,
        "content": "Local scientists from CORAL and the   made an exciting, new discovery during this year’s coral reef monitoring in Trujillo, Honduras. With the help of nearby fishers, they found multiple sites of new coral reefs that have not previously been monitored or studied by the local scientific community. For a while, local scientists suspected there were new reefs, but were unable to find them due to bad weather and other complications. “This is great news and we’re hoping it is just the tip of the iceberg,” says CORAL Conservation Program Director Jenny Myton. “It’s possible that there are even more reefs nearby.”  Trujillo’s newfound reefs are functional and have an estimated 12 to 16 percent live coral cover, compared to Trujillo’s average cover of just nine percent. If properly protected, new reefs in Trujillo may be beneficial for the entire Mesoamerican reef region.   According to HRI scientist Ian Drysdale, Trujillo’s new reefs are considered a “sister” to the reefs in Tela Bay, which are more than 100 kilometers away. This is because the dominant type of coral on the reefs is the same, as are many of the surrounding fish and wildlife. Studies show that fish connectivity between the two regions is high, with some scientists hypothesizing that Trujillo actually is a source of fish larvae for all of Honduras.   In fact, there is connectivity between coral reefs in many parts of Mesoamerica due to ocean currents. While  , reef-building corals release male and female reproductive cells known as gametes, which join together to form baby coral. The offspring then ride the current for up to three weeks before eventually attaching to a hard surface to grow.  “Marine currents can be very strong,” says Drysdale. “When massive spawning events happen [in Mesoamerica], it is in the rainy season with high winds, storms, and currents. This can send offspring farther away, versus when we have flat, calm seas.”  By discovering, monitoring, and protecting new reefs, like the ones found in Trujillo, we will also protect corals found in other parts of the ocean. With this knowledge in mind, CORAL works to establish healthy coral reef networks throughout Mesoamerica, thus protecting vital coral species, coastal communities, and surrounding wildlife.  When examining the Trujillo reefs, both Drysdale and CORAL Program Coordinator Paolo Guardiola noticed a lack of fish and physical evidence of reef damage, which point to signs of overfishing.  “We saw anchor scars,” says Drysdale, discussing the devastating damage found on an entire row of barrel sponges amongst the reef. “An anchor went right across [the sponges] and the scar was more than a meter wide and 15 meters long.” When protecting a network of sister reefs, it is important to address the direct threats facing each area. By minimizing overfishing and irresponsible practices in Trujillo, we will also improve the health of reefs in other locations.  That’s why CORAL turns directly to the local community in Honduras, working side by side with community scientists and local fishers to secure healthy fish populations for different reefs in the region.  “For about two and a half years, we’ve been collecting data to build a fisheries management plan,” says Guardiola. “If we protect reefs in Trujillo, we’ll also improve the local economy. Fishers will be able to collect larger fish and at higher quantities.” This ongoing data is shared with key stakeholders, like NGOS, local governments, and fishing communities, in order to create awareness and promote sustainable fishing practices that protect coral reefs.  As we continue to learn about Trujillo’s new coral reefs and the threats they face, our team, local scientists, and members of the community can continue to evolve practices and push for new protection measures—so coral reefs in Mesoamerica can continue to thrive for generations to come.  "

We are proud to be part of this important initiative that allows lagoons to rest and fish populations to recuperate, ultimately keeping coral reefs healthy and allowing fishers to catch higher-quality products.

This June, many of the world’s top coral reef scientists met at the International Coral Reef Symposium in Hawaii to discuss the challenges facing coral reefs. Sunscreen and other personal care product ingredients were hot topics. Of particular concern to scientists was oxybenzone, a chemical used in sunscreens to protect our skin from damaging UV light. Oxybenzone is bad news for corals, harming them by; Perhaps most alarming is that all of this can happen with very low doses of the chemical, only 62 parts per trillion (equivalent to one drop of water in 6.5 Olympic swimming pools)! Sunscreen can enter the water directly from our bodies while swimming, or it can wash off the sand at the beach. Spray-on sunscreens especially create a chemical cloud that often misses the skin and settles on the sand. As the tide comes in, all these chemicals wash into the ocean;   found higher oxybenzone concentrations in the ocean at high tide than low tide.

At a global scale, rising carbon dioxide levels are heating our planet. The recent El Niño, along with elevated temperatures, is causing widespread and devastating bleaching around the world.

At a local level, ICRS dedicated several sessions to the impacts of poor water quality on reefs, highlighting the important connections between land and sea. Other talks focused on the roles of herbivores in combating algae, and how over-fishing has reduced herbivore populations in many areas. Fortunately, amongst the bad news, there were some things that gave me hope. I felt a palpable sense of urgency at ICRS. Rather than being another scientific conference at which to learn about cool but esoteric research, this meeting actively sought to apply new knowledge to conserving coral reefs. To me, this underscores the importance of the work we are doing at CORAL to unite communities to save coral reefs. We can create the conditions for corals to survive climate change by building strong and effective management systems in which local people have the capacity and financial support for management. It’s also clear that this alone won’t be enough: humans need to drastically reduce emissions. I’m hopeful that the recent COP21 agreement ratified in Paris will create incentives for governments to act. It’s clear that time is running out for reefs and many other ecosystems: we need to act now if we want future generations to experience the wonder of coral reefs."

Did you know that some of the 129 species of butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae) are “mucus munchers?” As strange as it might sound, some butterflyfish take advantage of energy-rich coral mucus as a primary food source. Corals produce mucus as a protective layer or use its stickiness to trap food.  Butterflyfish feed on this nutrient rich layer and take advantage of this easy to consume food source. Other butterflyfish species feed on coral polyps or small invertebrates and plankton. Butterflyfish are fairly small and laterally flattened – they look like a disc with rounded fins. They are found around the world on coral reefs and are brightly colored, often with some combination of yellow, black and white. Many butterflyfish species are monogamous and territorial. You will often see a pair swimming together on a reef, although some species roam farther and in larger groups. They are active in the daytime and hide in crevices at night to avoid predators. When butterflyfish reproduce, they release buoyant eggs that float with plankton that once hatched, go through a larval stage where the tiny fish have plate-like armor, before growing into miniature adults. Next time you visit a reef, keep an eye out for these beautiful reef fish and see how many species you can identify."

One of the greatest rewards is meeting and working with such diverse groups of people and building strong connections with the communities in Fiji. Following Tropical Cyclone Winston, l discovered just how passionately connected to the Kubulau community I had become. I wanted to do more to help, and in July, I had an amazing opportunity to connect on a much larger scale at the inaugural Melanesian Spearhead Group, Emerging Leaders Program. Here, I learned about new ways to help community’s recovery from devastation and hardships caused by such a catastrophic storm. During the Melanesian Youth Leaders Forum, I met people from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji. We all shared our successes and challenges and along the way, we gathered valuable and shareable lessons. We were welcomed by the President of Vanuatu the Honorable Baldwin Jacobson Lonsdale in a traditional welcoming ceremony. The four-day program was in two broad parts: presentations by different organizations in the morning and traveling to field sites to see how the work is carried out in different parts of Efate. The most inspiring session was with the Minister for Lands, the Honorable Ralph Regenvanu. He spoke eloquently about his experiences growing up in the midst of Vanuatu fighting (to gain independence), and how they shaped and influenced his decisions. He realized early the importance of culture and traditions and that led him to study anthropology. When he saw that the work he was doing was being undermined by the way land issues were being handled, he returned to school to study law and then went into politics because the only way he felt he could make real changes was from the inside. The biggest takeaway emerged from the afternoon field site visits and the work being done by Wan Smol Bag, Activ, and Lapita. These three companies have managed to continue to work despite the challenges faced during and post-Tropical Cyclone Pam. Compared to Fiji’s recent Tropical Cyclone Winston, there are many similarities in the adversity they faced and how they are working on recovery. Activ is a company that sells local handicrafts and teaches those in the community how to make quality goods. Lapita is a bakery, owned by an indigenous local, who sources products within the community. Visiting these businesses, I immediately imagined how we could replicate these ideas in Fiji. These local practices perfectly pair with CORAL’s conservation work to create and support marine protected areas in an effort to create alternative livelihoods and lessen the reliance on coral reef resources. A unique lesson I learned is how theater and arts are used to share messages, or even provide meaningful alternative activities for young people. At present, much of the recovery effort has focused on basic necessities such as delivery of food, water, and rebuilding materials. Moving forward there is an opportunity to provide more support for emotional and psychological support for victims of Tropical Cyclone Winston. In Vanuatu, I saw the positive impacts that theater and arts played in helping communities cope with trauma. A lesson I can take back to Fiji. This forum is a powerful example of what can happen when you unite people from various communities from around the globe. I left the forum with new friends and ideas about how to help Fiji communities continue to recover from disaster. I look forward to sharing this knowledge with CORAL and the communities at the forefront of local conservation efforts here in Fiji."

        "content": "I spent September in Indonesia working with our field staff and visiting our partner communities in Karangasem and Buleleng in northern Bali. While there, I was invited to visit some coral reefs off the West coast of Sulawesi. It was rumored that some areas had 100 percent live coral cover, so I jumped at the chance to go and see for myself. Before I tell you what I saw in the water, I need to explain just how skeptical I was of the reported health of those reefs. I have completed more than 1,000 coral surveys in the past few years with Reef Check Australia and other research groups. In my experience, when people say a reef has 100 percent live coral cover it is usually closer to 70 percent. So, it was with some skepticism that I headed off to Sulawesi take a closer look. To get to the dive site I took a 30-minute boat ride from the city of Makassar in Southwest Sulawesi to Pulau Badi. The area off Makassar is heavily fished, using both cyanide and bombs, so I was not sure what I would find when I jumped into the water. What greeted me was amazing. There truly was 100 percent live coral cover. I hadn’t seen reefs like this ever before. They were beautiful—not many fish, but so much coral diversity. Moreover, I didn’t see any signs of bleaching, the global bleaching event of the last few years seemed to have left these corals untouched. What I found most interesting is that these healthy patches of coral were next to areas that had been bombed for fishing. These areas were not recovering due to unstable coral rubble being swept around in the currents. A group of us went to visit Pulau Badi to see how Mars Symbioscience is investing in restoring these damaged sections of reef. We hope to learn how some of these strategies might be applied to reefs in Bali. Ultimately, it is a relief to know that places like this still exist; that there are bright spots where corals are adapting and thriving, despite warming waters and the pressure of human activities. I got back on the boat a bit more inspired and determined to work ever more diligently to protect special places like this, and to reduce threats in places where coral health is poor. It is a reminder that corals can survive and adapt to a rapidly changing world. As humans, we just need to make sure that we are doing all that we can to support healthy reefs.

I’m sitting around a kava bowl with community elders, and we are discussing how to protect and conserve their marine resources. You see, this community depends on coral reefs, but the reefs are facing mounting threats. The elders are concerned: they want to ensure there are fish in the sea for their grandchildren and great grandchildren. I am here, in Fiji, as part of my work with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), and at the request of communities who have asked us to help them create effective and durable approaches to coral conservation. I am here to help save coral reefs. CORAL has worked in Fiji for the past 15 years. We’ve worked closely with the resource management committee in the Kubulau district—also known as the KRMC. The Kubulau community has traditional ownership of the Namena Marine Reserve—one of the largest   (no take) areas in Fiji. Through training and micro-grants, we have helped the KRMC increase its management capacity, including establishing a voluntary fee program for visitors. In 2015, the community raised more than $20,000 to support the Namena Marine Reserve, community infrastructure projects and scholarship programs that have benefitted more than 170 students. Over the last decade, we have seen the community’s capacity and autonomy grow. This was proven in February during the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Winston—a category 5 storm that passed directly over Kubulau. Following the storm, KRMC had the resources they needed to start the recovery process without opening their   area to fishing. By not using their marine resources, the community is helping the reef recover from the storm. (You can read more about KRMC’s post-Winston efforts  .) CORAL continues to play an important role in Kubulau and we have been pursuing ways to share our knowledge with other communities. This work bolsters efforts by the Fijian government to include 30 percent of its ocean in marine protected areas (MPAs) by 2020. Our work has paid off. We are thrilled to announce that thanks to a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of State we will expand our work to Cakaudrove, Ra and Lau provinces. In fact, we’ve already begun, and during my recent visit, I met with elders and community members from these provinces. What I learned is that each community approaches conservation in a different way. There is a unique opportunity in  . The elders are working with the government to launch a new nearshore management zoning pilot project. The project will identify different use zones in the marine environment such as fishing,  , and tourism. If successful, this approach could be rolled out to other communities across the country. is situated across the Bligh Passage from Namena Marine Reserve and many of its communities were hit hard by tropical cyclone Winston. In Ra, a number of governmental and non-governmental initiatives are underway to help improve management of marine protected areas. Oneta is 200 miles across open ocean from Fiji’s capital Suva. Part of the   province, this island is less than three miles long and is surrounded by an atoll of reefs. Conservation in Lau is more localized; many communities have established   areas through traditional agreements and with little outside support. The community on Oneata reached out to Fiji’s Provincial Conservation Officer from the iTaukei Affairs Board for help. They connected the community to CORAL. Together with partners, we will help these communities strengthen their approaches to conservation. Through training in topics like fisheries enforcement and financial administration, we will build the capacity of local communities to effectively manage their resources. We will use what we’ve learned from our work in Kubulau as the basis for building a network of effectively managed areas in Fiji. I look forward to my next visit to Fiji, to sitting down with community leaders to drink kava and talk about how we can save reefs. We look forward to once again sharing what we learn so that our collective successes can guide and shape conservation work across the entire region. We can save coral reefs for the children of today and tomorrow."

        "content": "It was early Sunday morning, in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Winston. No one knew the full extent of the damage it had left behind. Scattered reports were coming through the little transistor radio my mum kept for emergencies, and for the days and weeks that followed, it would prove to be an incredibly valuable device. My first instinct was to check on our partners and friends in Kubulau— they were in the direct path of the Category 5 cyclone. There was absolutely no way to reach them. The communication towers for both phone networks in Fiji were down. As reports started coming in from other communities and the devastation they faced, I began to worry. Did Kubulau make it? What had they lost? What did this mean for the Namena Marine Reserve and their pristine coral reefs? CORAL is closely tied with the people and districts within Kubulau. Since 2005, we have helped develop and create an effective and sustainable community group that manages the district’s natural marine resources, the Kubulau Resource Management Committee (KRMC). As I was about to discover, the KRMC proved its worth in the wake of Winston—not only to the people of Kubulau, but also to the reefs within the Namena Marine Reserve. Early Tuesday morning, when the cell towers were restored, I received a call from Peni Were, the coordinator for the KRMC. I was apprehensive about taking it—what could I say to someone who had potentially lost everything in the strongest cyclone to hit this side of the planet? My anxiety was quickly allayed by the decisiveness of our conversation. He spoke quickly through their harrowing experience. When I asked what they needed he sounded like he was reading off a list; pinch bars, hammers, cutters, and most urgent of all, chainsaws. He said, “Right after the cyclone, the KRMC organized all able-bodied men to begin clearing fallen trees on the roads and in the villages. In the last 24 hours, we’ve reached all accessible villages except three and have collected figures on the extent of damages.” In just three days, while most other communities in Fiji were still in crisis mode, this district had proactively begun their rehabilitation without outside assistance. As assessments conducted by the government’s Disaster Management Center indicated, the Kubulau district was one of the worst hit in Vanua Levu with more than 80 percent of houses destroyed. The quick recovery process is a result of their strong communal, traditional and familial ties. These attributes transferred to the KRMC and together, they were able to respond and fund their immediate recovery needs. Kubulau suffered great losses to their iqoliqoli (traditional fishing grounds). The local fishermen had two accessible iqoliqoli, and after Winston, one of them was completely destroyed; it was all sand. Despite this, they did not have to open up their tabus (restricted fishing areas). The reef fees they collect go into a community fund and savings account. This means the communities of Kubulau had the financial resources they needed to get by and make up for lost fishing and tourism incomes. As I was about to hang up, Peni told me that Paulo Kolikata, the recipient of the 2015 CORAL Conservation Prize, wanted to speak with me. The first thing he said was, “Isa Lisi, na nodatou vale sa yali” which means “Isa Lisi, our home is gone.” It hit me hard. In the iTaukei language, to say nodatou was to include me as a member of his home. We shared the loss. I choked back on tears as I thought of the lovely pale yellow concrete home that had billeted me just two weeks earlier. I returned to Kubulau three weeks after Winston. It was difficult, but I did not openly cry when I saw the destruction—it served no purpose; it would not bring back what was lost. What I could do was become an amplifier, to take the data and stories I had gathered and find ways to give back. Even though the state of their environment was dire, and the pain and grief of those affected could be heard under their cheery voices, what stood out most prominently was their resilience and their determination to move on, rebuild and grow. To note: Together, we grieved and supported our partners and friends in Kubulau. Thanks to CORAL’s generous supporters, we were able to send the KRMC more than $5,000 to buy chainsaws, gasoline and other much-needed equipment and tools."

Healthy reefs act as natural barriers that protect coastal cities, communities and beaches from pounding ocean waves. Without coral reefs, many beaches and buildings would become vulnerable to waves and storm damage. And with increasing storm intensity predicted as our climate warms, these coastal protection services will become even more important. Research conducted on Palmyra Atoll by members of the   found that pristine coral reefs dampen much more wave energy than expected. In other words, healthy reefs are better at protecting coastlines from wave and storm damage. Conversely, a reef that is not as healthy (perhaps due to poor water quality or overfishing) is less able to absorb or dissipate wave energy. This creates a negative feedback loop: less healthy reefs take more of a beating which leads to—you guessed it!—even less healthy reefs. Over time, this can cause previously protected coastlines to become more susceptible to wave and storm damage.

Because of these concerns, we have been working with our partners in these and other villages along the north coast of Bali to establish a network of well-managed marine protected areas that are ecologically connected and socioeconomically sustainable. Effectively managing this network requires the support of local communities. To garner this support, community concerns and knowledge must be understood and incorporated into management plans. To build an effective management plan, we partnered with Lens of the Community of Indonesia and asked villagers to use photos to document their natural environments, cultures, traditions and lifestyles. The photos tell powerful stories about how community members interact with nature and can identify issues and challenges that may affect management priorities. In both Tulamben and Amed, the photos identified sedimentation, trash and tourism activities as major threats to reefs. This was the first time community members had an opportunity to voice their concerns and their vision of their future and the future of their reefs. These photos can be used to build management plans and help governments and local NGOs better prioritize conservation initiatives.

Five hundred million people around the world depend on reef fish and other animals for food and income. In addition to providing a significant source of protein for up to a billion people, coral reef fish support commercial and artisanal fisheries and serve as a key tourist attraction. By one estimate, the coral reef global fishing and tourism industries are worth four hundred billion dollars each year. Many fish populations around the world, however, are overfished. Overfishing can harm reef ecosystems by removing fish that perform essential functions—for example, when too many herbivorous fish are harvested, reefs become overgrown with macroalgae (seaweed). Overfishing can also harm the communities that depend on reefs for income. Groupers are one type of fish that can be sold for a high value and given such, many species of groupers are overfished. Groupers naturally come together to spawn and such a fish aggregation can be very easy to harvest. Creating well-managed local fisheries helps fish populations like the grouper to recover after harvesting events and ensures that local communities can earn income over the long term. One way we work to create more sustainable fisheries is by the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), which are locations in which some (or all) types of fishing are banned. Over time and within an MPA, fish populations are able to increase and some fish will inevitably move out of the restricted area. In addition, fish within the MPA grow older and larger—they become “ ” (which actually is a real term used among researches that stands for “big old fat fecund female fishes), which produce more and better young. In these two ways, MPAs can help fish populations increase outside the MPA. Realizing the benefits of an MPA, however, requires that the MPA is effectively managed—that there are adequate staff to enforce regulations and they have the financial resources to support management activities.

Sharks are commonly misunderstood and widely feared. These remarkable animals, however, are valuable to the tourism industry and the economic health of coral reef destinations. A   from the Australian Institute of Marine Science found that shark tourism accounts for approximately eight percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the island nation of Palau. The study showed that the roughly 100 sharks inhabiting the most popular dive sites in the area were each worth $179,000 annually to the local tourism industry, giving each shark an approximate lifetime value of $1.9 million. Worldwide, established shark-related diving operations can be found in at least 83 locations in 29 different countries. However, shark populations are declining at an alarming rate. Approximately 30 percent of shark species are threatened or nearly threatened with extinction, and the status of another roughly 50 percent is unclear due to insufficient data. Intense commercial fishing is largely to blame for the decline, and shark finning, the practice of removing a shark’s fins and discarding the rest of the animal to die at sea, is particularly rampant. This practice is driven by demand for shark fin soup, a delicacy that creates a lucrative market for shark fins. Because most sharks reproduce late in life and bear few offspring, scientists fear that some severely depleted populations may take hundreds of years to rebuild. This frightening prospect has compelled conservationists, scientists and government officials to push for greater shark protection. Recently,   and the Maldives have created shark sanctuaries by prohibiting commercial shark fishing in their countries’ exclusive economic zones.   also implemented a shark fishing moratorium, and   has now instituted a retention ban aimed at banning the possession of shark fins in state waters.   recently signed a shark and ray sanctuary into law. Lastly, in  , we have worked with our partners to get better protection for sharks through wide-reaching media and education campaigns. These initiatives will educate communities about their vested stake in preserving healthy shark populations to support the coral reef ecosystems that provide them with food, income and coastal protection.

Nowhere is this more true than on coral reefs, where a worldwide crisis is underway that has scientists and environmentalists asking a chilling question: how can we save coral reefs? At the Coral Reef Alliance, we believe that the natural process of adaptation can help save coral reefs. A   co-authored by CORAL staff and others, argues that adaptation will occur faster and have a better chance of succeeding if nature has many options with which to work. Options take the form of different species, individuals and genes and work like tickets in a lottery: most are not winners, but a few have just the right combinations to succeed. This article outlines an innovative approach and practical advice about how we can facilitate the processes of adaptation through the creation of adaptation networks, which maximize the probability of nature finding the winners. Adaptation networks have three attributes. They are: Adaptation networks serve as experimental testing grounds where billions of evolutionary match/mismatch tests (lottery draws) allow nature to pick winning combinations of genes and species. As our climate continues to change, these winners are vital to creating the ecosystems of the future in which humans and other species can continue to thrive. This approach to the creation of adaptation networks is a direct contrast to many contemporary conservation strategies that are based on forecasting which species will succeed under future environmental conditions. However, it is notoriously difficult to predict the effects of climate change on local environments accurately, and even harder to predict which organisms will succeed in these anticipated conditions. In the face of this uncertainty, it is unwise only to protect those species or areas that we think will survive in the oceans of the future. It is for this reason that adaptation networks could prove to be the best method to save coral reefs by protecting diversity and allowing the natural selection process to happen."

Adaptive Reefscapes should be as big as possible to reduce problems caused by large disturbances; a small Reefscape might be at risk from one major hurricane or bleaching event, but a large Reefscape is more likely to include some reefs that are unharmed and can be sources of future recolonization. Large Reefscapes are also more likely to include lots of different kinds of reefs and corals. This diversity, which we described previously, acts as options for the future. Conversely, if a Reefscape is too big, baby corals will not be able to spread readily from one reef to the next, slowing down the potential for adaptation.

For his project, Justin chose to raise funds for the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and awareness about the current state of coral reefs. At an annual Innovation Fair in the early spring, students present products they design, test and mass produce to raise funds for their chosen organization. Justin designed and manufactured a beat blox, an “elegant, cordless iPhone speaker that doesn’t need to be charged.” At the end of the fair, Justin sold all 29 speakers and raised a record-breaking $580. Thanks to passionate donors like Justin, CORAL can work with communities to help save coral reefs for future generations. Please read through our Q&A with Justin to learn more about his project, his interests and why he cares about saving coral reefs. If you would like to purchase a beat blox of your own, please email  . The goal of my school project was to raise awareness of what is happening to the coral reefs and to try to stop these delicate ecosystems from being destroyed. Coral reefs are so beautiful. I saw pretty amazing ones in the Philippines, and I know that they are in danger of dying all around the world because of dynamite fishing, human carelessness and pollution. Coral Reefs are very important because they protect the coastline from damaging storms and waves and they provide a habitat, shelter, and protection for thousands of marine organisms. By making people aware of the situation reefs face and getting support, I was also able to raise funds. I thought of a new product that would appeal to my school community that I could manufacture by myself. I love music, so I decided to make an iPhone speaker. I made a few prototypes that failed, or that didn’t look that great. It was very frustrating coming up with the idea. Finally, I came up with a speaker that worked, was solid and not too expensive to make. When I was sure I had my finished product, I started manufacturing the speakers. I created flyers to advertise to the school community. I also presented the product at the school assembly. I tried to create some buzz by talking to students about it. When I was researching for an organization, I was overwhelmed with the number of choices. It was hard to tell which one was better. But Coral Reef Alliance had a  , so I thought that was a good sign. It also sounds like they are doing good work around the world. I hope someday they help the coral reefs in the Philippines as well.

        "content": "\nStudies have been done, published scientific articles have been peer-reviewed, and   of publishing climate scientists agree that human activity over the past century is causing global climate change. Currently, coral reefs are suffering great losses due to local threats, such as overfishing and unsustainable tourism, and global threats, such as rising ocean temperatures. As the executive director of a coral conservation nonprofit, I must ask myself how we can save coral reefs. Fortunately, we have an answer found with the corals themselves. Today there is a growing scientific evidence that corals can adapt to environmental changes. In fact, corals have been adapting for hundreds of millions of years. We can see evidence of coral adaptation everywhere on coral reefs. For example, scientists are discovering corals that are thriving in harsh conditions, like the unusually warm waters in lagoons in American Samoa. These special corals are defying the assumption that corals are fragile and headed for extinction. To save coral reefs, we must reduce local-level threats to reefs that help these special corals survive, grow and spread their special genes to future generations and withstand global threats – this is the process of coral adaptation. Seizing upon this revelation, CORAL is pioneering an innovate conservation blueprint called   – healthy networks of  ,   and   reefs. Adaptive Reefscapes include many types of reefs, habitats, species and genes. We safeguard DIVERSITY to preserve options for an unpredictable future. Rapid adaptation requires a CONNECTED network of healthy reefs such as Marine Protected Areas or Locally Managed Marine Areas to facilitate the spread of baby corals to different reefs and repopulate degraded reefs. Small networks of reefs are vulnerable to a single disturbance such as a storm or a disease outbreak. Connecting LARGE networks of reefs protects reefscapes against losing everything all at once. With our many partners, we are creating an Adaptive Reefscape along the Mesoamerican reef region, which spans the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. Already, we have been able to identify key reefs where we can give corals a leg up by reducing coastal pollution and improving fisheries management. We are also developing a mathematical model to pinpoint additional reefs that we should protect to help corals adapt. Our goal is to launch similar Adaptive Reefscapes in three other key coral reef regions around the world. Creating successful reefscapes in these regions will provide a proven blueprint for global coral reef conservation."

        "content": "Coral reefs mean different things to different individuals depending on their connection (or lack of connection) to them. For those that are landlocked or have never visited tropical waters, coral reefs probably don’t often come to their mind. However, for individuals like Justin Jesuele, a seventh grader at Viewpoint School in California, coral reefs and the ocean bring fond memories of sandy beaches, warm water and a sense of belonging. Recently, we featured a   about Justin’s school project when he created beat blox to raised funds for CORAL. This second post will provide more insight into this creative self-described environmentalist who wants to share his love of coral reefs with the world. Justin’s first memory of the ocean was as a very young child vacationing to  with his family. While there paddling on a boogie board with his good friend, he saw his first sea turtle in its natural habitat. He remembers the moment vividly because it made him feel like he belonged there experiencing nature and its “diverse ecosystem full of marine life and cool animals.” In addition to boogie boarding, Justin also loves doing activities such as snorkeling where he’s able to “see the beauty of the ocean.” Like others fortunate enough to visit coral reefs, Justin particularly enjoys and appreciates the “beautiful underwater world” created by corals and the diversity of animals and fish that live on, in and around reefs. His favorite type of coral is the brain coral or  . He’s fond of this coral because it’s long evolutionary history and because “it looks so much like a brain!” Justin also has a favorite reef fish: the black tip reef shark. He saw his first one while snorkeling in the Philippines off the coast of  . Having held a long fascination with sharks, Justin likes to equate them to the cops of the marine world due to their ability to help maintain the delicate balance between fish populations in marine ecosystems. He also enjoys the Hawaiian triggerfish ( ) simply because of its “really cool” name in native Hawaiian: humuhumunukunukuāpuaʻa; I mean, who can blame him! However, Justin worries about the future of our underwater havens. As Justin likes to put it, “coral reefs support all the life in the ocean in that all of the lives are interconnected in the marine ecosystem. Marine animals depend on coral reefs for protection and habitat. They are important to the ocean ecosystem. Also, coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and waves. Coral reefs are dying because of human carelessness and ignorance. Climate change, dynamite fishing and pollution all disturb the ecosystem — that can’t be good for the animals that live in the ocean or for the human species as a whole.” As an environmentalist, Justin cares about the positive and negative effects we have on our planet. He wants “to keep nature safe, and coral reefs are such an important part of the ocean.” The future of coral reefs is bright due to young champions like Justin who one day will don the mantle of coral preservation to save coral reefs."

        "content": "  The   in American Samoa is a special place. It’s a place where turtles lay their eggs on the beach, sharks swim around the bay and young corals grow everywhere. Not too long ago, however, the local coral reefs had been devastated by overharvesting and pollution. What changed to allow these reefs to recover? Tisa Fa’amuli, a native Samoan and self-described eco-warrior, decided to take it upon herself to restore the reef. She created a   to raise awareness about the Sanctuary and expressed her mission to CORAL Board Member Michael Bennett, who recently visited American Samoa and had the opportunity to document and share Tisa’s inspiring story. Tisa Fa’amuli’s story starts on the island of Tutuila where she was born and raised by her father Afenoa. Being the second of twelve children, Tisa learned many lessons from her father about working hard, providing for a large family and respecting the land. “This is where I learned about conservation,” Tisa notes. While growing up in the 50s, “these words were not used: conservation, sustainable. We lived it. We didn’t identify them. It was a way of life. It was a way for survival.” These lessons stuck with Tisa and shaped her future in unexpected ways. At the age of 34, after numerous years living away from home, Tisa moved back to her hometown of Alega from San Diego, California and didn’t recognize her childhood village. The fish in the bay were gone, the coral reefs were dead and the beaches were covered in debris. Tisa soon realized “that this village needs to be restored.” To help kick start restoration efforts, Tisa and her two sons started clean-ups along the coastal highway and beaches. Local community members thought she had lost her mind “because nobody cleans the highway; it’s the government’s job.” It was around this same time in 1980 that Tisa decided to start protecting a small strip of beach and coastal waters near her property, creating a self-declared marine sanctuary. Her goal was to restore the local marine life back to what it was when she was a child. She created her own no-take zone that was largely enforced by word of mouth and a variety of self-enforcement methods. She and her partner, Candy Mann, performed night patrols looking for poachers and used flash lights to scare them away, sometimes even getting in a kayak to chase them off of the protected area. In 1989, inspired by these experiences, Tisa started Tisa’s Barefoot Bar & Eco-Resort, using the profits to help fund her conservation efforts. Over the years, Tisa learned to use education and outreach as an effective tool for protecting her special sanctuary and gaining local buy-in. By speaking with local fishermen and villagers, she could convince them about the importance of caring for the marine environment, not catching baby fish, or not catching entire schools of fish. “I would just engage them in conservation and have them really feel my heart as a sincere way (not) to come and destroy or kill the reef, walk on the reef (or) try to get the fish” explains Tisa. “I put it in forms of education that they understand.” In order to ensure that these life lessons get passed down to future generations, Tisa has started training her grandchildren on how to protect the reef and has shared stories from her father about always caring for the land and taking pride in your roots. Thanks to Tisa’s time and effort, in 2013, the local government officially created a no-take Marine Protected Area (MPA) with a stated goal to “educate other communities how to start Marine Sanctuaries to protect our beautiful islands and education on indigenous fishing seasons and methods.” Tisa’s future goal is to have a place that is open to local people to come, learn and enjoy marine life in perpetuity, and, through her hard work and dedication, she has created just that opportunity."

Every two years, the  , an international alliance of over 60 organizations including CORAL, publishes a Report Card on the status and trends of reef health in the MAR using data collected* from over 300 sites across 1000 kilometers and four countries. HRI Report Cards give sites a reef health score, analyze changes over time, and propose actions to improve reef health and enable reefs to endure and thrive.   The recently released   tells us that overall reef health in the MAR has improved from an initial reef health index of Poor (2.3) in 2006 to Fair (2.8) this year, using a scale that ranges from Critical (1) to Very Good (5). The positive trend is a result of increases in fish biomass, which are attributable to stronger fisheries management and a significant increase in Marine Protected Areas, which now cover 57% of the MAR. Of the four countries that comprise the MAR – Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico –   received the highest score for reef health (3.0). In addition to having relatively high coral cover, Honduras has the highest biomass of herbivorous fishes (like parrotfish and surgeonfish), which feed intensively on macroalgae, a kind of fleshy algae that can grow unchecked in polluted waters and outcompete corals for space. We are pleased to report that the reefs in West End, Roatán, where CORAL has close to 15 years of engagement, are among the healthiest reefs in the entire region. In line with the 2018 Report Card’s Call to Action for Honduras, CORAL is addressing both   through our   and   Initiatives. HRI commenced the   in a big way with simultaneous launches of the 2018 Report Card in Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

CORAL was proud to participate in Honduras’ Report Card launch on January 10  in Tegucigalpa. The 2018 Report Card also marks a decade of data collection by HRI, providing an important temporal perspective on trends in reef health. Despite the fact that corals worldwide were hard-hit by mass bleaching over the last few years, 10 years of reef monitoring by HRI tells us that things are looking up in the MAR. With the 2018 Report Card launch marking a decade of collaboration and conservation, the good news for the Mesoamerican region’s reefs, and the kick-off of the third International Year of the Reef, 2018 is off to a great start!    "

        "content": "Bali’s Mount Agung erupted again on February 13, 2018, just days after Indonesian authorities lowered the alert status from Hazardous (Level IV) to Standby (Level III). The eruption lasted just over two minutes and spewed ash and smoke 1.5 kilometers into the air. Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported that there was no damage, community activities are running normally and flights to Bali continue to operate despite the eruption. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) continues to monitor and support our community partners in the affected villages of Tulamben, Amed and Jemeluk. Mount Agung began exhibiting pre-eruption seismic activity in September, 2017, and authorities evacuated communities within a 12-kilometer radius of the volcano. When two eruptions occurred in late November nearly 140,000 people had been evacuated, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Mount Agung erupted again several times but with less intensity, and authorities lowered the alert status to Level III on February 11, 2018. But two days later the volcano erupted again and reignited fear and anxiety in nearby communities. Concerns are especially heightened as older generations vividly remember the devastating effects of the 1963 eruption, which claimed the lives of approximately 1,600 people, destroyed dozens of villages and lasted for almost a year. I Made Jaya Ratha, CORAL’s Indonesia Program Coordinator, reports that most evacuees from Tulamben have returned home, and reef monitoring and trash cleanup programs have resumed. Challenging conditions such as lack of food and crowded sleeping areas have been contributing factors in the decision to return home to an at-risk area. But life at home is not easy, says Ratha. Tourism is the primary economic driver for many coastal communities in the region, and a scuba diving moratorium in Tulamben closed resorts in October and November. The tourism industry is also struggling in the nearby villages of Amed and Jemeluk, after visitors canceled bookings in light of travel warnings. Meanwhile, prices of fresh produce have increased as ash falls on fields that lack farmers to tend them. Despite these challenges, communities are coming together to rebuild their lives. CORAL staff brought fresh water, vegetables and ventilation masks to evacuated communities during the worst of the volcanic activity, and are working with villages to prioritize their needs. While the memory of the 1963 eruption still looms in their minds, community members are returning home, looking forward and hoping for a calmer future."

        "content": "Popularly known as staghorn corals, due to the similarity of their structure with that of the antler of the mammal in question, the   corals are one of the most important corals in the region of the Mesoamerican Reef System (MAR) because they are reef builders. Thanks to their strong substrate and their peculiar shape,   offer shelter to juvenile fish and protect coastal communities against strong waves. However, there are relatively few places in the Caribbean that still hold large extensions of this coral species. One of these is the Cordelia Banks Wildlife Site, located on the southwest of Roatan Island, Honduras, where the number of   individuals is impressive, says marine biologist  , coordinator of the Smithsonian Institution’s  . “The number of these corals in that bank is surprising, especially after the massive die-off—due to an unknown agent—that in the 1980s reduced their presence in the Caribbean. Approximately 90 percent of them were lost. In addition, this population managed to recover from a bleaching event that affected the corals of Roatán about four years ago and continues to survive, despite being located very close to cruise ship docks and the amount of pollutants it receives from nearby populations,” adds Canty. And it is precisely these signs of vitality and resilience of the   of Cordelia Banks that make it a site of interest not only for tourism but also for science, as a source of propagules (coral larvae) with the potential to repopulate reef communities in the MAR region. For this reason, the organization   (CORAL) sponsored the study of the genetic diversity of the corals of the Cordelia Banks, that is, the total number of different genetic characteristics among them. Such differences are a basic component of biodiversity, and the greater the genetic diversity, the more likely a species is to survive environmental changes. To carry out this research, CORAL contacted Steven Canty, who together with fellow scientists Graeme Fox, Jennifer K. Rowntree, and Richard F. Preziosi, produced the study entitled:   It was published in February 2021 by the journal  (the article is open access) The summary of the document states that: “Amongst the global decline of coral reefs, hope spots such as Cordelia Banks in Honduras have been identified. This site contains dense, remnant thickets of the endangered species  , which local managers and conservation organizations view as a potential source population for coral restoration projects.” According to Canty, CORAL, in addition to being interested in the knowledge of this important coral bank for the MAR region, wanted to have solid scientific evidence to update their management plan. However, how do you manage corals if their biology is unknown? For this reason, he and his colleagues conducted the previously mentioned study. Cordelia Banks is a protected area formed by four coral banks where   sharks and a spawning site for snappers and groupers are present. Samples for the study were taken in 2014 from three of those banks: Big Cay; Cordelia Shoal and Smith Bank. Biologist Mayra Núñez Vallecillo was one of the researchers who participated in the collection of samples. Mayra describes Cordelia Banks as a paradise under the sea, and indicates that having participated in this field work helped her expand her knowledge of coral reefs. According to the biologist, research of this type is important to generate adequate management and conservation tools for the protection of marine ecosystems, on which not only plants and animals, but also people depend upon for their survival. Canty indicates that an important survival mechanism of   fragmentation and the fragmented pieces are carried by the currents, therefore, they can settle in places near or far from the specimen from which they were detached. This situation makes it difficult to determine whether a new coral comes from the same individual, a clone (asexual reproduction), or is the product of the union of two different ones (sexual reproduction). If the specimens come from the same individual, their use to restore degraded coral areas would not be the best option, because since the fragments have the same genetic material, they would all be susceptible to the same diseases or disorders caused by stressful situations, Canty explains. In Cordelia Banks, where the large numbers of colonies of this species cover about 63,440 square meters, “it was possible to identify a low genetic diversity in the three banks of the protected area and the genetic similarity of the colonies ranged from 91.3 to 95.8 percent between the banks. ‘Clonality’ rates were approximately 30 percent across all three banks. And each genotype identified was unique to each bank,” the study notes. “Subtle differences were demonstrated within and among the banks, that is, not all of them come from the same individual. The presence of multiple genotypes suggests   colonies from these banks could be used to maintain and enhance genetic diversity in restoration projects.” For this reason, the study indicates that “management of hope spots, such as Cordelia Banks, and the incorporation of genetic information into restoration projects to ensure genetic diversity within out-planted populations, will be critical in the ongoing challenge of conserving and preserving coral reefs.” Canty explains that he is happy with these findings from the study, because there is more genetic diversity in the   of Cordelia Banks than they thought, and it motivates him to conduct a similar study with mangroves and seagrasses because it is important to know the existing connectivity between small populations in these ecosystems and in the entire MAR region. The data obtained, as well as those produced by the aforementioned research, are used to develop management plans based on scientific evidence. Furthermore, they contribute to identifying the potential for adaptation of ecosystems, so that coastal communities know how to lead this management. For a conservation strategy to be successful, it is necessary to involve the people living in the area, says the biologist. Canty’s recommendation, for those who lead coral restoration projects with fragments of the Cordelia Banks corals, is that they keep a genetic diary, so that they know which fragment and from which colony they used to transplant in a certain site. , an environmental engineer and CORAL’s Regional Program Director in the MAR, explains that the efforts of her work are focused on actions that will help the Mesoamerican Reef thrive. For example, it is imperative that the inflow and negative impact of wastewater on Cordelia Banks be reduced, as the quality of the surrounding water must be optimal in order for it to remain healthy. The conservation work at Cordelia Banks, which according to data from the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative has 72.23 percent live coral (the average in the MAR is 19 percent), also aims to honor its declaration by the Honduran government as a Site of Importance for Wildlife. This declaration, achieved in 2012, took seven years of work from various governmental and non-governmental organizations, among them CORAL. For that reason, the data produced by the study by Canty and colleagues will be useful for teaming up with the other organizations involved to update the site’s Management Plan and to determine and guide the actions to be implemented, concludes Jenny."

        "content": "The CORAL family came together last week in a unique way. A few months ago, the Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS) reached out to Jaya Ratha, our program coordinator in Bali, to help organize the arrival of the Hōkūleʻa in Indonesia. The Hōkūleʻa is a double-hulled standing canoe traveling around the world using traditional navigation methods. Their voyage, called  , or to care for the Earth, is an effort to bring together global partners to protect our Earth and our oceans. “One of the things that was interesting to me was that Hawaiʻi and Bali have a lot of similarities in terms of culture,” said Ratha. Bali and Hawaiʻi were designated as sister states back in 2014, as they are both hugely popular tourism destinations and they share similar histories. This amazing around-the-world voyage brought the Hawaiian culture and heritage to Indonesia—making these two diverse islands feel incredibly connected. As a complete coincidence, CORAL’s Program Coordinator in Maui, Chana Ane, remembers going on one of the early launchings of the Hōkūleʻa and her family is extremely involved in PVS. During its voyage, the Hōkūleʻa stops in various ports to raise awareness. The PVS brings in teachers from Hawaiʻi to join the crew and bring traditional knowledge and contemporary ideas to local communities. The Hōkūleʻa arrived in Bali on August 1, after leaving Australia, and we, along with Reef Check Indonesia, Lensa Masyarakat Nusantara (LMN) and CI Indonesia, helped connect them with various communities in Bali, including the Amed community in the Karangesem regency. The community in Amed has worked hard to protect its ocean environment, which is now officially recognized as a locally managed marine area. The arrival of the PVS helped raise awareness about their work. In addition, it helped connect the community with local government officials to highlight the conservation initiatives underway. While in Amed, the Hōkūleʻa team snorkeled with a community guide and saw the effects of the various threats harming coral reefs. These threats were not unknown to them, as many mirror the same ones affecting Hawaiʻi’s coral reefs. They also learned about traditional salt making, and heard from a small group of people trying to protect and maintain Balinese antiquity. The group shared stories and spoke about traditions and their different cultures. What they learned is that they face similar challenges. Tourism is increasing in Bali. Particularly, in the small town of Amed where people are struggling to protect their values and beliefs. The PVS team from Hawaii was empathetic. They passed along insight on how their state has coped with the influx of tourists, and how they’ve worked to protect their environment, heritage, and cultural identity. Our international teams are spread out all over the world, but we are all connected in various ways. The coming together of the Hawaiian and Balinese cultures made that very evident this week. Like the PVS, we believe in global partnerships. After all, we won’t be able to protect coral reefs without them. Read more about the Hōkūleʻa’s visit to Bali on  , updated regularly.  "

But imagine going back to school and learning about real local issues, and then learning real life skills and using them to solve actual problems in your community. That’s what students in Mr. Ryan Duffy’s class went back to this year. Mr. Duffy teaches sixth through eighth grade math and science at ROOTS school in Haiku on Maui, Hawaiʻi. Last October he came to CORAL’s Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) workshop and learned how to teach his students about the importance of watersheds in a way that’s fun and exciting. He’s applying those skills, and his students are completely engaged! Soon after the workshop, Mr. Duffy’s students started designing a system to capture rain water off their school’s rooftop. They collected data to determine the average rainfall for their region, and measured the surface area of the school’s roof. They compiled this information to calculate the amount of rain they could catch and researched various rain water harvesting systems. They even built a first flush diverter to prevent the polluted water from the beginning of a rain event—and all the debris it brings off the roof—from entering the water catchment tanks. By spring, the students had completed their data collection and calculations and were ready to install their water catchment tanks. Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company donated two 500-gallon water catchment tanks, and CORAL’s Program Manager, Wes Crile, and Mr. Duffy helped install them.  The school is now able to divert about 1,000 gallons of rainwater from entering the ocean at nearby Hoʻokipa Beach each time it rains. Hoʻokipa isn’t too far from the world-famous surf spot, Jaws, and it’s a popular place for windsurfing and kite surfing. Preventing rainwater from entering the ocean there not only helps protect human health, but also helps protect coral reefs. The students will continue the project this year by measuring the rainwater catchment system and its impacts. They will also start monitoring water quality at Hoʻokipa beach and learn about the impacts that sediment and rainwater runoff have on the coral reefs. Soon they’ll start to see how their school project fits into the health of the entire watershed."

        "content": "You’ve probably heard about it in the news. You may even remember living through it in the early 80s and 90s. El Niño is here. It’s already impacting the Pacific Ocean and this August, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) saw variances in sea surface temperatures near or greater than 2.0 degrees Celsius. El Niño refers to warming waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Those warmer waters spread to the east, bringing with them a drastic change in weather patterns. Scientists predict that this year’s El Niño is extreme and may last through the spring of 2016. That means trouble for coral reefs. In fact, NOAA recently announced that “bleaching due to heat stress is expected to impact approximately 38 percent of the world’s coral reefs—and almost 95% of those in U.S. waters.” When water temperatures grow too warm, corals become stressed and oust the tiny algae that live in their tissues, called zooxanthellae. Corals and zooxanthellae have a mutually beneficial relationship that can be disrupted by changing temperatures. Without zooxanthellae, corals lose an important food source which significantly limits their ability to grow. Zooxanthellae are also responsible for giving corals their brilliant and vibrant colors—without them, corals bleach and turn a skeletal white color. Coral bleaching isn’t necessarily the same thing as corals dying. Corals can survive bleaching events, but their survival is contingent on the how warm the water gets and how long the warm period lasts. They will, however, have a harder time recovering if they are already struggling or unhealthy. If there’s a back-to-back series of warm water events, and if corals are already stressed from overfishing and pollution, mortality rates can skyrocket. Given the local threats reefs face in many places, we can expect high coral mortality especially if this year’s El Niño is as strong as scientists predict. We’re disappointed to report that we’ve already seen coral bleaching in Hawai‘i and elsewhere in the Pacific. The warm waters of an El Niño are also associated with an increase in the number of tropical cyclones. These weather events can cause a lot of physical destruction to a reef. If corals bleach, they have a hard time recovering—their growth is curtailed without their partner, zooxanthellae. The combination of increased water temperatures and storm activity can be a “double whammy” for coral reefs. El Niño is a natural phenomenon and we can’t stop it. When you add an El Niño to an already stressed system its effects are more severe. So what can you do about it? You can reduce your emissions and advocate on behalf of clean energy. When you’re out diving you can report bleached corals to local reef managers or to ReefBase (www.ReefBase.org). You can also help us do what we do best—unite communities to reduce local threats. If reefs are healthy, with clean water and an abundant amount of fish life, we can expect the corals to come back later. If we combine our efforts across the globe we can help give corals a fighting chance at surviving these environmental changes."

        "content": "Coral reefs are a hot topic these days. They’re all over the news—coral bleaching, constructing islands on top of reefs, and sunscreen pollution. Even the   has been running a series of articles on coral reefs. I’ve worked with corals for more than 10 years and I can’t remember a time when they’ve ever been so mainstream and popular. But here’s the problem: it’s all doom and gloom. All of the news that’s coming out is bad news. Where’s the optimism? Where’s the hope? Where are the success stories? That’s one of the things I love about CORAL. We know we CAN save coral reefs, and with the right amount of support, we WILL. And that’s why I enjoyed my most recent trip to Bali, Indonesia. I strategically aligned my trip so I could attend the first-ever Buleleng Bali Dive Festival, which was held in Pemuteran. Some of you may remember hearing about it at our 2014 Gala, when the Indonesian Minister of Fisheries and Affairs announced the festival for the first time. The festival was a huge success—complete with a parade, traditional ceremony, educational talks, and of course, unforgettable diving. But, what really hit home on this trip was seeing how motivated and impassioned the local communities are about protecting coral reefs. It was the success stories that really stood out. Take Nyoman Suastika for example. Nyoman lives in the community of Tulamben, a small fishing village in Bali known for one of the best wreck dives in the world. Divers and dive operators consistently dive in this area, but the increase in tourism was damaging the coral and harming the ecosystem. Dive operators from out of the area accompanied visiting divers, which meant a lot of the benefits of tourism weren’t staying within the community. As a result, the community didn’t have the resources to protect the environment. Nyoman took notice and started talking to his community about the issue. His community had a no-take conservation area, and he attended trainings to learn how to turn it into a formalized Marine Protected Area—a conservation area that is formally recognized and supported by the national government—and to ensure it is effectively managed. With the help of CORAL and our local partners, Nyoman organized his community to take action. Together, they established a local group of dive guides called Organisasi Dive Guide Tulamben. Dive operators from outside of Tulamben now call on the local group to lead their trips, instead of sending in guides from outside the area. As a result, more of the tourism fees stay within the community. This enables the community to oversee and manage how their local coral reefs are utilized. CORAL is helping Nyoman and his community protect and manage the local coral reefs in a variety of ways. This includes: Nyoman is an incredibly humble and down-to-earth individual. His motivating driver is simple: his goal is to improve Tulamben’s reefs. He envisions a future where his community understands that conservation is beneficial and leads to a healthy reef and community. He envisions a community that prioritizes sustainable land-use practices. And he envisions an ocean without trash and with an abundant array of fish and wildlife. There is so much incredible work happening in Bali, and around the world, to protect coral reefs. THIS is the kind of ground-up work that we should see in the news. I hope Nyoman’s story inspires you as much as it inspires me. Together we CAN and we WILL continue to protect coral reefs for generations to come."

        "content": "On the northern coast of Honduras, just a few miles west of Tela through lush tropical forests, sits Laguna de los Micos. The Laguna is a treasure trove of biodiversity, surrounded by mangroves and separated from the Caribbean Sea by only a few feet of sand. It’s one of the area’s most important coral reef habitats, and serves as a respite, home and nursery for hundreds of coral reef fish. The Laguna has always been an important area for local communities, providing subsistence and livelihoods. But in recent years, the fishermen weren’t catching as much. Fish populations seemed to be disappearing. Laguna de los Micos is part of the Parque Nacional Jeannette Kawas. The area is protected and has a management plan that includes fishing regulations. For example, boats cannot carry more than 600 meters of net, and the mesh size must be at least three inches. In some waterways you can only fish with hook and line, and spear guns or dynamite are prohibited. The regulations are numerous—but there was never enough money or local participation to enforce them. This year, CORAL and many of its local partners, helped create a patrol program for the lagoon. The Institutional Committee of Fisheries and Marine Resources in Tela*—a conglomeration of government organizations and local NGOs—provides the resources and man-power. CORAL provides the funding and training. A typical patrol may include a car from PROLANSATE, a boat from DIGEPESCA and field techniques from each organization. It’s a true example of collaboration, and it works. Fishermen now report seeing mackerel over 30cm in length, and many regularly catch jacks that weigh more than 10 pounds. The fishermen support the patrols, and are grateful that they are conducted by a local committee. They say it keeps the process honest and transparent. This collaboration is an exemplary model. It’s proof that great things happen when we work together. Conservation isn’t just about protecting the environment, it’s also about working alongside the communities that rely on that environment. And when governments, communities and NGOs partner together, environments thrive."

        "content": "It’s 6:45 a.m. when Paola Urrutia arrives at Tela Bay. She makes her way down to the water, finds the spot where the fishermen will disembark after their morning catch, and sits down to wait. On the northern Caribbean coast of Honduras, Tela Bay sits at the bottom of a gently sloping tropical forest, marked by beautiful white sand beaches and sparkling turquoise water. It’s home to some of the healthiest coral reefs in all of Central America—scientists estimate that the bay averages about 70% live coral cover, the highest in the Mesoamerican Reef system. When she sees the first boat begin to approach, Urrutia pulls out her equipment and marks down the time of arrival. She approaches the vessel and requests permission to collect data from their catch. The fishermen are used to her presence by now and her research has become a standard part of their disembarkation routine. She analyzes the fish they caught, carefully documenting all of her measurements. Urrutia was hired as CORAL’s first community scientist in Honduras in 2015. Today she’s one of three community scientists that CORAL employs in the country to gain a better understanding of what is happening to local fisheries. CORAL’s community scientists live in or near the communities where they work, which helps them build relationships and gain trust. They tend to be women, most often from minority groups, who have struggled to find adequate employment and face social and economic vulnerability. Though several of them come from fishing backgrounds with relatives and family members who fish, this is their first foray into science and research. CORAL Program Coordinators train them on the basic science of fisheries and how to appropriately and accurately collect and monitor data. “I have changed a lot thanks to CORAL,” says Greissi Lizeth Villatoro, who began working as a community scientist in early 2019. She works in Laguna de los Micos, a popular fish nursery in the lagoon that feeds Tela Bay. “I have learned many things that I did not know, and taking the data has also helped me a lot.” The program not only provides the scientists with paid employment and much-needed economic stability, but CORAL’s Program Coordinators also encourage the women to work toward personal goals and pursue their education as a way of investing in themselves and their families. Urrutia herself left her role as a community scientist in 2016 to go back to school at the urging of CORAL’s then Program Coordinator. Now that she has graduated, she has come back to CORAL, and has taken on more duties. She’s now supervising the maintenance and data collection of CORAL’s experimental aquaculture project in Tela—a project designed to create an economic alternative for fishermen—in addition to working as a community scientist in Tela Bay. Through their relationships, the women have created a network of fishermen that help support science and understand the importance of rules and regulations. They’ve become a regular presence at community meetings, and report back on their findings to help fishermen understand what is happening underwater. “The most important impact that I’ve noticed is that now people have more respect for closed seasons,” says Urrutia. “Before, 100% of fishermen went out to fish during the closed season, now only between 10-20% are going to fish illegally.” Urrutia has also noticed an increase in fishermen who talk openly about complying with regulations—they chat with each other about following regulations and avoiding damaging practices like anchoring on the reef. Practices that protect the environment are becoming more commonplace. Villatoro has also seen changes among the crabbing community in the lagoon near Tela. “Through the data collection, the crabbers have been learning the appropriate size of crabs to capture,” says Villatoro. “The fishermen’s company has stopped buying small crabs, and several fishermen have stopped using illegal nets where the mesh size is less than three inches.” This change in behavior is a direct result of the relationships and trust the community scientists have built within their communities. They have gained a reputation as being allies, and fishermen see them as a key component to decision making and managing their resource. “In the community where I come from, the work of a community scientist is seen as a means to improve fishing and to find out how the resource is doing,” says Ana Bessy Valdez. She joined the CORAL team in July 2019 and was the first community scientist to start monitoring in Trujillo Bay, the southern border of the Mesoamerican Reef system. “Fishermen are aware that data collection is to improve fishing and they want to know what alternatives they have for bad seasons.” Though not all of the fishermen that Valdez meets choose to provide her with data, the majority enjoy collaborating. Back in Tela, Urrutia casually chats with the fishermen while she takes her measurements. She asks them about their fishing location, depth, travel time, and expenses. The fishermen know Urrutia by now, and they trust her. They tell her who is still out on the water, and when and where they will likely land. She packs up her equipment, and relocates down the beach so she can be ready for the next arrival. When the last boat arrives at 10:00 a.m., she takes her last measurements, and bids her fishing friends farewell. She’ll be back tomorrow, same time, same place."

Throughout my time here, that initial impression has held steady: our staff works tirelessly every single day to support the local communities that depend on coral reefs, and together with our partners, they move mountains to ensure coral reefs have what they need to not only survive, but thrive. And our supporters remain steadfast in their commitment to protecting coral reefs for generations to come.  That is why I am full of both sadness and gratitude as I write to inform you I have decided to step away from my role as CORAL’s Executive Director. CORAL is a remarkable organization, and one that I will always hold dear to my heart. I am grateful that this position has allowed me to explore nonprofit administration and management, which has  led me to realize that my passion lies in conducting the direct science and conservation work that makes CORAL thrive. It has been an absolute honor to witness how CORAL has evolved over the last decade. We have grown to become a leader in a ground-breaking conservation movement that uses evolution to rescue reefs from climate change. We continue to partner with communities to protect coral reefs, but we now focus on directly addressing the biggest threats to reefs, like poor water quality and overfishing, and we do it in a way that allows coral reefs to adapt to climate change. And most recently, when the world was rocked by a global pandemic, we pivoted to ensure our partners could continue their reef-saving work amidst their unprecedented economic losses.  The CORAL Board of Directors has launched a   for a new Executive Director to assume responsibility when I depart in early June. I am confident that my successor will bring CORAL’s work at local, regional, and global levels to new heights as CORAL continues its vital efforts to keep coral reefs healthy so they can adapt to climate change. Thank you for all of your support over these last 10 years. I will miss this tremendous organization and community dearly, though I look forward to our paths crossing in a new way as we all continue to fight for coral reefs.  Thank you for your ongoing commitment to CORAL, and for making my time here so memorable.  With heartfelt appreciation, Madhavi Colton, Ph.D."

Nearly $375 billion in services comes from coral reefs alone each year.

The decision by the partisan and politicized Supreme Court to ignore science and instead rule in favor of corporate revenue puts us all at risk. Without clear action from our nation’s leaders, the lifesaving measures we need to curb emissions and slow the rate of climate change are out of reach.  In January, a report by the International Panel on Climate Change showed that if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half by 2030, we can still limit global warming to 2.7°F. The report showed that was an achievable target with appropriate government action. We are currently on track for 4.9°F of global warming, which from a coral reef standpoint alone, would create simultaneous ecological, humanitarian and economic crises.  Now is the time to take bigger, bolder action to address the climate crisis.

        "content": "The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) was honored to be recognized by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies Annual Meeting as one of six organizations and individuals to receive The Climate Adaptation Leadership Award for Natural Resources (CALA) on September 9, 2020. The CALA was established in 2016 to recognize exemplary leadership in the field of climate adaptation and the protection of the nation’s vital natural resources and the people who depend on them in a changing world. “Climate change poses growing risks to our nation’s valuable fish and wildlife resources and the many people, businesses and communities that depend upon them,” stated Kelly Hepler, President of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and Secretary of the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks. “This year’s awardees have done outstanding work to help safeguard species, habitats, and communities in a changing world, and we are thrilled to recognize their efforts.” In 2015, CORAL launched a pioneering research project to understand what actions we can take today to help corals adapt to climate change. The results, published in Nature Climate Change, show that evolution can help rescue reefs from the effects of climate change. The research shows that when we conserve a diverse portfolio of coral reefs species, variable environmental conditions and significant connectivity, we enable the necessary conditions for nature’s survivors to spread their genes to future generations. The research also shows that adaptation is possible when local stressors are reduced across a network of sites. The result is an Adaptive Reefscape: a network of healthy reefs in which corals can adapt to climate change. A vitally important component of CORAL’s Adaptive Reefscape approach is that the reefs within the network are healthy. This means that reducing direct threats to reefs, particularly unsustainable fishing and land-based pollution, is essential. Well-managed reefs serve as sources of repopulation over the long-term, enabling coral survivors to rescue other reefs across a region. As a leader in coral conservation, CORAL works with communities and conservation professionals around the world to turn the peer-reviewed scientific results into action to give reefs the best chance to survive the coming decades. “We are beyond thrilled to have been selected as one of this year’s CALA Award winners for our work on Adaptive Reefscapes,” says Dr. Madhavi Colton, Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “Our research shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if they are kept healthy. It is an honor to have the backing of fish and wildlife agencies as we work with local communities and conservation professionals around the world to create the conditions in which corals can adapt.” This award is sponsored and guided by the Climate Adaptation Leadership Awards Steering Committee which is made up of representatives from the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and various Federal agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

On this night, coral polyps release bundles of eggs and sperm into the water forming billions of free-floating larvae. These baby corals are starting unique journeys, following ocean currents for a few days or weeks before settling down on new reefs. Some corals stay close to home, while others travel for many kilometers to distant reefs. If they are lucky, they’ll find a safe place to call home, and will flourish and produce offspring of their own. This connection of reefs at the local scale is an important attribute in an  , which are  , connected and large networks of healthy reefs designed to help corals adapt to climate change. Baby corals are looking for a reef that has conditions that match their individual needs. With a changing climate and local human-threats, many reefs are getting warmer, more polluted and generally harder on baby corals. But some baby corals are special because they inherited an ability to thrive where others can’t. When reefs are well connected, these special corals can grow and spread from one reef to the next, building the reefs of tomorrow. We can help corals by creating safe environments, such as Marine Protected Areas or Locally Managed Marine Areas, which provide the best conditions for baby corals such as clear water and healthy fish populations. By creating a network of healthy, connected and diverse reefs, we can ensure that baby corals can always find a good place to thrive, grow and reproduce through to the next generation.

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and are home to 25 percent of all marine life though they occupy less than one percent of our oceans. There are sponges and corals of all shapes and sizes, hard and soft; tiny fishes like pygmy seahorses and big fishes like tiger sharks; there are anemones, nudibranchs and snails – the list goes on! Reefs are also diverse in types of habitats: fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls to name a few. Even a single species of coral is genetically diverse. But why does coral reef diversity matter in an era of global climate change? We all know the facts: corals face an uncertain future due to local threats, such as pollution and overfishing, and global threats, such as climate change and ocean acidification. But without the reef-building corals, like staghorn or elkhorn, there is no reef and no habitat for the myriad forms of life that call reefs home. If we are to have reefs in the future, these reef-builders will need to adapt. Fortunately, scientific research shows us that corals can adapt to changing climates. At the Coral Reef Alliance, we are developing a blueprint based on cutting-edge science that promotes coral adaptation within diverse, connected and large networks of healthy reefs called  . Our Adaptive Reefscape strategy draws ideas from evolutionary biology, economics and ecology. Evolutionary biology tells us that adaptation is more successful when there is a lot of diversity, like the diversity found within the many types of reefs, habitats, species and genes on coral reefs. In this case, more diversity means more evolutionary options for the future. Similarly, financial investors know that diversifying their portfolio can hedge bets against an uncertain future. In a diverse investment portfolio, some stocks behave independently from one another making the whole portfolio more stable. Researchers have discovered that diversity also affects ecological systems, which are less prone to boom and bust cycles when they are diverse. By combing these ideas in an Adaptive Reefscape that safeguards a diversity of habitats, species and genes, corals will be better able to adapt to global environmental changes and survive for centuries to come. We are first applying our Adaptive Reefscape strategy to the Mesoamerican Reef, which spans the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. In this region alone, there are over 60 species of coral. Two sites in this region are showing promising signs of adaptation. Corals in Tela Bay on the mainland of Honduras are thriving in murky waters. Off the coast of nearby Roatán, there are unusually lush stands of staghorn coral, which has declined almost everywhere else in the Caribbean. When corals surprise us by doing particularly well in unexpected places, it suggests that they may have already adapted to some of the threats that are facing coral reefs. Adaptive Reefscapes are designed to protect a diversity of reefs and corals so that special corals—like those in Tela and Roatán—can be the source of baby corals that will thrive in the future.

        "category": null,
        "content": "From raging wildfires to melting glaciers to coral bleaching—it is clear that there is pressing urgency to face the planet’s climate and ecological emergency. After postponing last year’s event due to COVID-19, the   (IUCN) decided to hold its quadrennial   from September 3 to 11, 2021 and commit to actions that will ensure a more sustainable future.  Members from more than 160 countries in government, science, civil society, and business sectors met in Marseille, France—along with many more participating virtually. One of those attendees was CORAL’s Hawaiʻi Regional Program Director  , representing the Hawaiʻi Conservation Alliance, an IUCN member organization and previous host to the 2016 World Conservation Congress.  We had a chance to catch up with Mejia after he returned from Marseille, getting a “behind-the-scenes” look at the main highlights and why there are reasons to be optimistic.  Previously, Mejia attended the 2016 Congress that took place in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, where a new membership category called the “Indigenous Peoples Organizations” was formed. Since its establishment, Mejia has noticed a significant increase of individuals from the Indigenous Peoples Organizations represented at IUCN.  “Indigenous voices are finally being elevated and listened to,” says Mejia, expressing the importance of taking a biocultural approach to conservation. “In the Pacific, and in Indigenous cultures in general, people are part of the equation. They aren’t separate from nature. As nature thrives, people thrive.”  At the Congress, Mejia proudly represented our partners in Hawaiʻi at the “Pacific Pavilion,” where members living in Oceania and the Pacific Islands spoke about topics relevant to their region. Mejia gave a presentation and shared the significance of “mauka to makai” conservation approaches in Hawaiʻi, or “ridge to reef.” He explained why taking care of land and sea is an important element to local cultures and island communities, like Hawaiʻi, and how communities are leading conservation efforts guided by Indigenous values and knowledge. Climate change was also an important topic at this year’s event. During the Congress, the Union made great progress by establishing the first official “Climate Change Commission” within IUCN—a motion widely led and supported by members of the Hawaiʻi Delegation, including Mejia.   According to  released by IUCN, “A climate crisis commission with a single focus to implement a unified plan to save the earth—providing a venue for those who wish to be part of the final stand—will protect future generations, Indigenous people and nature.” This new establishment will contribute to the worldwide effort to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the planet’s changing climate. This decision was a major victory for the Hawaiʻi delegation, as they feel firsthand the impacts of climate change to the Pacific. “Small islands are the canaries in the coal mine,” says Mejia. “They are the most vulnerable frontliners when it comes to climate change impacts.”  As a whole, Mejia felt this year’s Congress took an “all hands on deck” approach to conservation—with a strong sense of inclusion, collaboration, and dedication.  From   to presentations by youth conservationists to the involvement of the Marseille community, people from so many generations, backgrounds, and countries joined forces to seek nature-based solutions. Even French President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech, demonstrating his leadership in tackling climate change and expressing the importance of protecting nature—as our well-being depends on it.  Recent reports and studies all show that there is a dire need for real change. But Mejia is optimistic and sees this as an opportunity to come together and amplify meaningful conservation efforts. In the words of Harrison Ford, “We’ve got to get to work. We’ve got to make things happen—we’ve got to make it happen now.”"

        "content": "On October 5, 2021, the   released its latest  , detailing the status, trends, and predicted futures for the world’s coral reefs. After analyzing almost 2 million observations collected in 73 countries, one key message is abundantly clear—coral reefs are in trouble.  We’ve lost 14 percent of the world’s coral reefs in the last decade and according to Dr. Madhavi Colton, CORAL’s Executive Director, this is likely a conservative measurement. “It’s the equivalent of losing the entire Great Barrier Reef in 10 years,” she says.  Sadly, global findings show that many reefs are diminishing, instead of flourishing. This decline is mostly attributed to large scale   events, which first captured the attention of scientists in 1998 and have since become a regular occurrence. Climate change leads to warming ocean temperatures which can trigger bleaching and ultimately impact the health of coral reefs.    When corals die, algae can take over a reef and create a hostile environment that inhibits new coral growth. The GCRMN measured a 20 percent increase in algae living on coral reefs from 2010 to 2019, further demonstrating the severity of local reef threats and bleaching events.  But despite these upsetting statistics, the GCRMN also validated corals’ resilience and underscored the importance of acting quickly to save coral reefs. “The report isn’t an obituary—the report says there is still hope for coral reefs,” says Colton. “If you look at the data, there are times when corals have recovered.” According to the GCRMN, coral reefs have the ability to recover when the conditions permit. This can include minimizing water pollution or addressing overfishing, in order to create more optimal conditions for reefs to adapt to climate change. In fact, some reefs in the East Asian Seas region with high coral cover and diversity have already shown signs of natural resistance to increasing temperatures. Here at CORAL, we believe reefs can adapt to the effects of climate change if they are healthy. Over the last five years, we’ve been spearheading research to better understand what coral reefs need in order to adapt, and how to create those conditions in the real world. Ultimately, what it comes down to is working with local communities to keep corals healthy, and doing that in strategic places around the world.  That’s why we work with partners, governments, and members of local communities in the Mesoamerican region and Hawaiʻi to ensure cleaner, healthier reefs. Through these collaborations, we have trapped sediment before it reaches reefs in West Maui, supported community scientists working with fishers in Trujillo, monitored water quality in Roatán, and more.   The GCRMN report is out just in time for the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) and the UN Biodiversity Summit, when world leaders will join together to discuss future actions to address climate change, as well as ocean protection. “I hope this report becomes a large, loud alarm bell,” says Colton. “It provides the justification needed for world leaders to take a strong stance.”  In fact, the GCRMN report is already creating a buzz, with coverage appearing in major outlets like The New York Times and CNN International. And it’s important to continue spreading the word and educating the public about the significance of protecting coral reefs.  After all, coral reefs are strong and resilient, but they are also undeniably vulnerable—and if we want to save them, we need to take action now. "

        "content": "By Madhavi Colton, Ph.D.; Helen Fox, Ph.D.; Lisa McManus, Ph.D.; and Malin Pinsky, Ph.D. The trends are clear: around the world, coral reefs are dying. Just a few weeks ago we learned that we lost 14% of the world’s coral reefs in just 10 years, and that the primary driver of this decline is climate change. This obviously isn’t good news. Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine species despite occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor. They also provide food, income and storm protection to over one billion people. In total, they provide benefits worth over US$375 billion each year. If we lose coral reefs, it won’t just be a biodiversity crisis—it will also be a humanitarian and economic crisis.  As all eyes turn to the   this month, we have to ask: will this be the year we finally commit to saving these valuable ecosystems? Climate change is here, and it’s only going to get worse. But despite these dire reports, humanity has a critical window of time for action. And we know this because our research shows that we still have time to save coral reefs. We have spent the last five years of our careers as coral reef scientists investigating the best ways to protect coral reefs from the global changes coming their way, like warming ocean temperatures. We built sophisticated mathematical models to understand how and whether reefs can survive. Our results show that there is hope for coral reefs: they can adapt to cope with a warmer world, but only if we act quickly.  To give corals the best chance of adaptation, two things must happen: 1) we need to reduce local human impacts on reefs like overfishing and pollution; and 2) we must rapidly slow and then stop climate change.  Countless communities, nonprofit organizations and governments are doing their very best to reduce local stressors to reefs. They are improving water quality, reducing overfishing, and combating land-based pollution.  At the  , we have seen the community in West End, Roatán in Honduras galvanize their resources to get a wastewater treatment plant up and running. The result has been a 99% reduction in bacteria in nearshore waters, not only making the ocean cleaner for coral reefs, but also making it more sanitary for the people who swim and fish in those waters. In Hawai’i, over 100 community volunteers have come together to keep 25 tons of sediment off the coral reefs of West Maui by reforesting degraded landscapes with native plants.  The communities that depend on coral reefs the most are doing what they can to protect their livelihoods and their homes. And while these efforts are critically important, they will ultimately be in vain if our global leaders don’t take immediate action to reduce the amount of warming that our world is on track to experience.   We need to reduce emissions, and we need to do it now. This can only be accomplished through coordinated international efforts.  If we commit to reducing carbon emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, science indicates that corals can adapt to a warmer world. To achieve this requires immediate and dramatic global action. There is no time to waste. If COP26 in Glasgow results in real promises that lead to real change, then we still have time to avert the extinction of one of the world’s most important ecosystems.  But if we continue on our current emissions trajectory, it is going to be very difficult if not impossible for corals—and many other species—to adapt quickly enough. That’s why we, as coral reef scientists who care deeply about what’s at stake, join faith leaders, health professionals, community members and business stakeholders in calling on world leaders to set ambitious targets to lower emissions and translate that commitment to action. If we act now, there is still hope for coral reefs and the billion people who depend on them. But if we don’t, we’re looking at a much more difficult and treacherous road ahead.  Madhavi Colton, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance Helen Fox, Ph.D., Conservation Science Director of the Coral Reef Alliance Lisa McManus, Ph.D., Assistant Research Professor at the Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology at University of Hawai’i at Manoa Malin Pinsky, Ph.D., Associate Professor and Director of the Graduate Program in Ecology & Evolution at Rutgers University"

This annual event, conceived as a heartfelt thank-you to our generous donors, took on a new dimension in light of recent events and became a profound benefit for a vital cause. As the sun set, guests gathered at the stunning Pacific Club to embark on an evening of enchanting music and camaraderie. The event kicked off with a delightful spread of pūpūs, featuring a medley of mouthwatering appetizers inspired by Hawaiian cuisine. Amidst the laughter and mingling, we took a moment to share a little about our work and the purpose behind Music on the Reef. The event was initially intended as an expression of our gratitude to our donors, but due to the devastating wildfires in Maui, it gained a new purpose. The wildfires in Maui served as a stark reminder of the challenges our beloved islands face due to climate change. In response, we launched the Community Resilience Fund, a testament to our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our natural treasures and the communities who rely on them. These underwater marvels, coral reefs, are the lifeblood of our oceans and a cornerstone of Hawaii’s vibrant ecosystem. The loss in Lahaina served as a wake-up call to many, including our organization. One of our program staff was directly impacted in a life-changing way, and at that moment, we knew we needed to be prepared for more major disasters as climate change ramps up. Enter the Community Resilience Fund, which we officially kicked off on September 14th at Music on the Reef. Major weather events, due to climate change, are realities we cannot ignore. It’s a menace that threatens not just our musical harmony but the very existence of the coral reefs that inspired this event. Coral reefs are the backbone of our marine ecosystems, nurturing a wealth of biodiversity and supporting our fisheries. Protecting them is not just an environmental imperative; it’s a duty we owe to future generations. In response to climate change, we are securing funds for coastal communities just like Lahaina. Through research, conservation initiatives, and community engagement, we are committed to ensuring the people who protect our underwater wonders endure for generations to come. With the crowd’s spirits lifted and hearts warmed, it was time for the main event—a concert that transported everyone to a world of musical enchantment. The stage was graced by a lineup of extraordinary musicians, featuring the incomparable Josh Nakazawa on cello and the legendary Jake Shimabukuro (ukulele), our CORAL ambassadors, alongside world class virtuosos–concertmaster for the Hawaiian Symphony Orchestra, Ignance Jang (violin), Shawn Conley (bass), Megan Conley (harp), Jasmine Nagano (piano), Natalie Mitchell (voice), Kevin Chang (voice), and Jackson Waldhoff (electric bass). All played with heartfelt intensity and artistry, which captivated everyone. The ensemble featured an array of instruments, from strings to keys, chilling vocals, and the soulful strumming of ukuleles. The synergy between these diverse sounds created a mesmerizing fusion of melodies that resonated with the very essence of Hawaii’s rich cultural tapestry. As the last note hung in the air and the crowd erupted in applause, it was evident that the evening had left a lasting impact. Beyond the musical celebration, Music on the Reef was a clarion call to action. What makes events like this even more remarkable is the unwavering support of the Hawaiian community. Time and again, we have witnessed resilience and determination when it comes to safeguarding our natural treasures. We are immensely grateful for their continued support, and it serves as a testament to our shared dedication to fighting for our coral reefs’ future. The second edition of Music on the Reef was a resounding success, both in terms of musical splendor and its impact on our collective consciousness. As we look ahead to future editions of this event, we do so with a renewed commitment to the cause and a profound sense of gratitude for everyone who joined us on this journey. To all our donors, supporters, and the entire Hawaii community, we say mahalo nui loa. Together, we will continue to harmonize for a sustainable future where our coral reefs thrive, and the melodies of Music on the Reef continue to enchant generations to come."

Climate REEFS will help solve this problem by identifying adaptive reefs from space and by characterizing the social vulnerabilities of different stakeholders, particularly women and marginalized groups. The project will quantify how reef structure predicts species and genetic diversity, which likely links to a reef’s capacity to adapt to climate change. It also aims to develop socially equitable, context-specific climate adaptation pathways. “Climate REEFS will implement social research to identify the climate vulnerability of coastal communities together with gender and socially inclusive adaptation pathways, geospatial research to detect adaptive reefs from satellite-derived data, and ecological and genomic research to pilot an analysis that tests the interplay of climate change-adaptiveness from genes to people,” said  , University of Leeds, and lead PI of the project.  “The impacts of climate change are not felt evenly across genders and geographies. It is particularly important to understand how degraded coral reefs are impacting women and other marginalized groups in the Asia Pacific so we can design climate adaptation strategies that support all members of a community,” said  , Managing Director of Rare’s Fish Forever program. The project aims to work both on local and national levels towards sustainable climate-smart coastal fishing livelihoods. “Climate REEFS will help people in the village get information on the health of their reefs, how they are used, and help develop policies about their future use. Most fishers never see the reef so they don’t realise their impact,” said  , Director of Maritime and Marine Science Center of Excellence at the Pattimura University. “It is exciting to have this multi-disciplinary team coming together to conduct innovative research that will inform policy and management as well as strengthen science capacity in Indonesia and the Philippines,” said  , Conservation Science Director of the Coral Reef Alliance.   Climate REEFS is part of CLARE’s first cohort of projects. CLARE is a £110m, UK-Canada framework research programme on Climate Adaptation and Resilience, aiming to enable socially inclusive and sustainable action to build resilience to climate change and natural hazards. CLARE is an initiative jointly designed and run by the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office and Canada’s International Development Research Centre. CLARE is primarily funded by UK aid from the UK government, along with the International Development Research Centre, Canada.  The project is also funded through FCDO’s £154m COAST programme, which is part of the UK’s £500m Blue Planet Fund portfolio. COAST aims to support climate change adaptation and more prosperous, sustainable, and resilient coastal economies, focusing on protecting and restoring coastal habitats, strengthening the sustainability and climate resilience of small-scale fisheries, unlocking more sustainable aquaculture production, and driving inclusive coastal governance and planning.

        "content": "In a heartbreaking turn of events, two large coral reefs off the coast of Honduras as well as other reefs in the Caribbean have fallen victim to the destructive forces of coral bleaching, a consequence of warming waters due to climate change. The catastrophic damage of these vibrant and biodiverse ecosystems underscores the urgent need for immediate action to protect and restore our oceans. The dangerous combination of rising ocean temperatures and poor water quality has led to widespread  , presenting significant challenges to Cordelia Banks, a protected area off the SouthWest coast of Roatan in the Bay Islands, as well as Capiro in Tela off the North coast of Honduras. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing the loss of their vibrant colors and weakening their ability to survive. Corals can bounce back from bleaching events, especially if they are healthy and the environmental stressors are alleviated in time. These once-thriving reefs, teeming with life and biodiversity, now highlight the pressing challenges climate change poses to our planet’s delicate ecosystems. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and our partners stand at the forefront of the battle, leveraging 30 years of expertise and unwavering commitment to coral reef conservation. Together, we’re dedicated to not only addressing these challenges but also to revitalizing and restoring the vibrancy and biodiversity of these essential marine habitats. With our commitment to preserving these underwater wonders, CORAL emphasizes the importance of acting swiftly to prevent further damage to neighboring reefs. Our team and partners focus heavily on reducing stressors to the reef, including securing clean water and implementing sustainable fishing practices, to give corals a better chance of survival in warming waters. I’ve lived alongside these reefs most of my life, so to see this devastation first-hand is heartbreaking. We need all hands on deck to swiftly reduce local threats to allow coral reefs to adapt to climate change. The most important local actions needed are to eliminate sewage pollution, increase protection, and implement effective management measures to restore the ecosystem so it can adapt to more challenges ahead. Now, more than ever, we call on individuals and organizations to   and accelerate the expansion of our efforts to reduce threats of wastewater pollution in Tela, Coxen Hole, and other emblematic sites across the Western Caribbean. The time to act is now, as we witness first-hand the window of opportunity to safeguard these precious ecosystems rapidly closing. First and foremost, our focus is on understanding the full impact. We’ve partnered with the Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI) to apply the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) for past studies and will join forces with them again to assess the ecological impacts and reef health monitoring in emblematic sites across the Mesoamerican Region. We’re also delving into the social and economic impacts, exploring potential partnerships to broaden our insights. When it comes to interventions, we’re identifying both short-term and long-term solutions, such as promoting sustainable tourism best practices to reduce pressure, supporting sustainable fisheries, and effective enforcement within the MPAs, as well as collaborating closely with the Bay Islands National Marine Park Technical Committee (BINMP-TC) and the Tela Inter-Institutional Environmental and Protected Areas Committee (CIAT) to continue assessing the situation and planning joint next steps. Communication is key. We’re keeping decision-makers and local communities in the loop with briefings and clear information. Feedback from our team on the ground and in the water will be critical to sharing updates. Once we’ve assessed the situation, we’ll enact next steps to maximize resilience. This will include more effective management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), like providing technical assistance to local stakeholders, capacity building, and funding MPA co-managers to implement their critical programs. On the local front, we’re teaming up with partners like The Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA) and Tela Reef Friend’s Association (AMATELA) to tackle local sanitation issues through water quality monitoring. We are working alongside local organizations in creating budgets and fundraising to make sanitation management models a reality. The goal is to have these models adapted to different coral reef communities around the world. Tools to replicate these adaptable and scalable management models will be publicly available this summer. Click here to be notified when this toolkit is available. (link to a sign-up page) And, of course, we can’t forget about the reefs themselves. Simultaneously, we’re supporting the enforcement of MPA regulations and safeguarding fisheries by partnering with the Roatan Marine Park (RMP) and the Foundation for the Protection of Lancetilla, Punta Sal and Texiguat (PROLANSATE) to ramp up patrols. RMP and Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA), lead efforts to identify restoration methods for the damaged reefs, which complement our priorities to address wastewater and fisheries. Collectively we’re actively looking into what research is needed to ensure we’re making all the right moves. Collaborating with experts to fill information gaps related to sanitation, coral health, and water quality is a priority. We’re building capacity for MPA co-managers, ensuring we have the knowledge and skills needed for effective conservation. Our work isn’t limited to reacting to the current threats; we’re working diligently to shape a resilient future for our coral reefs and the communities that depend on them. Your support is pivotal in turning these plans into action. So what can you do? To make a global impact, think local. Support local initiatives and conservation organizations, adjust your daily habits to include more sustainable practices, and keep learning. Then turn that knowledge into practice. Together, we can safeguard our oceans and leave a legacy of thriving marine ecosystems for generations to come."

        "content": "As we celebrate Earth Month, a time dedicated to preserving the beauty of our planet, it’s critical to confront the brutal reality facing one of its most iconic ecosystems: coral reefs.  Today,   that “the world is experiencing its fourth global coral bleaching event.” Since early 2023   Tragically, NOAA’s report shares that they have “now received confirmation of widespread bleaching across parts of the Indian Ocean, including Tanzania, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Tromelin, Mayotte, and off the western coast of Indonesia.”   as we’re seeing coral bleaching  . Let’s talk about what this means and what’s next. As global temperatures continue to rise, marine heatwaves have become more frequent and severe, subjecting coral reefs to prolonged stress. The result is widespread  , a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to their stark white appearance and eventual death if the stress persists. This fourth global bleaching event is a glaring reminder of the urgent need for decisive action to combat a warming planet and help coral reefs adapt to climate change.  If there was ever a time to roll up your sleeves and get involved in this fight,   We must take immediate action to lessen further damage to coral reefs while they’re in this vulnerable state.  The CORAL team worked together to launch the   last summer. This toolkit provides essential resources and strategies to aid in conservation efforts surrounding a bleaching event. A recent update includes more remote sensing and on-site monitoring resources and introduces a section dedicated to online apps. As we face mass coral bleaching, we hope that the update of our Toolkit and Guide provides a timely compilation of resources of what can be done before, during, and after a bleaching event, and galvanizes support for these amazing ecosystems. The toolkit contains actionable guidelines for reporting bleaching events, monitoring reef health, and implementing best practices for tourism sites to minimize additional stress on coral ecosystems. By following these guidelines and taking proactive measures, we are helping reduce stressors to coral reefs to minimize the devastating impacts of bleaching on marine biodiversity.  Coral bleaching demands urgent global collaboration to highlight its severity and drive better policies. This Toolkit consolidates information from diverse organizations working on coral bleaching into one accessible resource. Now, urgent steps are needed to integrate these efforts and datasets to ensure unified communication. In addition to providing guidance and resources, like the coral bleaching toolkit and water quality monitoring protocol, all members of the CORAL team are committed to the collective action of our alliance and partnerships, especially supporting local efforts on the ground and in the water. As our conservation science work has shown, corals can adapt to climate change…if we help them. Our team is working diligently toward   in coastal communities so coral reefs have a fighting chance in this warming world. During these critical times of bleaching, we’re working closely with our partners to assess the evolving situation and provide necessary resources and funding for monitoring efforts and studies. In our 30 years of coral conservation, we know   More specifically, this includes sharing replicable models to empower coastal communities near priority reefs to take control of their wastewater treatment and fishing practices. It also includes education around sustainable tourism and augmenting ocean literacy, particularly for youths. As we sit on the cusp of this fourth global bleaching event –   – we’re reminded of the urgent need for bold and decisive action to protect coral reefs from the consequences of coral bleaching, as well as addressing the root cause: climate change. Corals will not survive for generations to come unless rising carbon emissions are tackled with intention.  We must come together as a global community to protect and preserve these invaluable ecosystems. By leveraging the power of science, innovation, and collective action, we can alter the grim trajectory we’re on and reposition coral reefs toward a more sustainable future. As part of the CORAL community, we must continuously reinforce that action is the best remedy for despair.  For all media inquiries, please contact Kate at  ."

        "content": "Coral reefs, rainforests of the sea, are magnificent and diverse ecosystems teeming with life. Within this underwater wonderland,   Remarkable creatures like parrotfish and surgeonfish serve as nature’s custodians, diligently preserving the health of coral reefs by curbing the growth of algae, which, if left unchecked, can pose significant threats to the entire ecosystem. Among the many herbivorous fish species, parrotfish and surgeonfish stand out for their remarkable contributions.  Parrotfish, in particular, exhibit a fascinating life cycle. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, beginning their lives as females and later transitioning into males as they grow and environmental factors change. (What?!) Living in harems, where one dominant male controls a group of females, parrotfish are essential for maintaining the delicate balance within the group. If the alpha male is removed, it takes several months for a female to transition into the male role, impacting the reproductive cycle of the school. Surgeonfish, with their distinctive spines and vibrant colors, are another vital component of coral reef ecosystems.   These herbivorous fish species, with their unique traits and behaviors, contribute significantly to the overall resilience of coral reefs. , constantly feeding on algae that grow on coral reefs. Algae, when left uncontrolled, can outcompete corals for space and sunlight, eventually smothering them. By  , herbivore fish help to maintain the growth and vitality of corals, ensuring the reef ecosystem thrives. Moreover, some herbivores, like parrotfish, also aid in coral growth by  . This seemingly destructive behavior promotes the development of new polyps,  . These natural processes, guided by the activities of herbivorous fish, are essential for the overall health and biodiversity of coral reefs. While herbivore fish are indispensable guardians of coral reefs, their populations face numerous threats, with overfishing being one of the most pressing concerns.  disrupts the natural balance within herbivore communities, leading to a decrease in their numbers. When these essential fish are overharvested, the algae they would have consumed takes over. As a result, corals become vulnerable, facing increased competition for space and sunlight, and are more susceptible to diseases. The  , impacting not only the herbivore fish but also the corals, other marine life, and, ultimately, the communities that depend on these reefs for their livelihoods. , including agricultural runoff, plastic waste, and chemicals, can contaminate the water, disrupting the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem. Prolonged exposure to pollutants weakens the immunity of corals and herbivore fish, making them more susceptible to diseases and other stressors.  Rising sea temperatures due to global warming cause  , a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leaving them vulnerable and colorless.  , another consequence of climate change, hampers the ability of corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, making them weaker and more susceptible to damage. What makes these threats particularly concerning is their interconnected nature. Overfishing weakens herbivore fish populations, making them less resilient to other stressors such as pollution and climate change. Likewise, the impacts of pollution and climate change, such as coral bleaching and weakened corals, create additional challenges for herbivore fish by reducing the availability of suitable habitats and food sources. Addressing these threats requires a comprehensive approach that involves sustainable fisheries management, reducing pollution, and mitigating climate change. Conservation efforts, such as those championed by organizations like Fishpono, are instrumental in raising awareness, conducting research, and implementing initiatives to protect herbivore fish populations and coral reefs. Together, through collective action and a shared commitment to marine conservation, we can ensure that herbivore fish continue their vital role as guardians of coral reefs, preserving these magnificent underwater ecosystems for generations to come. Here’s to a future where the unsung heroes of the coral reefs thrive, and the reefs themselves continue to enchant and inspire us all."

        "content": "In the conservation and nonprofit sector, we throw around a lot of acronyms.  To our team, none are more important than “MPA” – a marine protected area. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designated areas of the ocean that are set aside for conservation and management purposes. These areas are intended to preserve and protect the marine life and their habitats within them. They also promote sustainable use of these resources. By establishing MPAs, we can ensure that our oceans remain healthy and full of life for future generations to come. Research has shown that MPAs can significantly improve carbon sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms, as well as the catches and income of fishers. But, efficacy matters. Why are MPAs so important to our mission, you ask? They can be as effective as national parks for areas of preserved land.  But only if they are truly managed effectively.  What we don’t want is “paper parks” – parks that are established but then lack sufficient management and enforcement of regulations and conservation plans.  Any park can look good on paper but an effective MPA takes the work of many nonprofits, local governments, and community stakeholders. In the Western Caribbean, CORAL is working hard to reduce local threats to coral reefs within marine protected areas (MPAs) and to construct regional collaborations that facilitate better protection and regulation of these ocean zones. MPAs are critical if we want vital ecological entities like the Mesoamerican Reef System (MAR) – which stretches 625 miles along the coast of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras and is the largest reef network in the western hemisphere – to recover and heal from damages caused by  , land-based pollution and unsustainable tourism. To give corals the best chance for adapting to climate change, CORAL focuses on what is putting them at risk, including improving MPA governance in Honduras, Belize and Mexico. But, why do MPAs matter? Firstly, MPAs provide a sanctuary for marine species. With over 90% of the world’s fish stocks either fully fished or overfished, it is essential to protect the habitats and breeding grounds of marine species to ensure their survival. Fully and highly protected MPAs create safe spaces where fish populations can thrive, reproduce, and grow in numbers. In turn, this supports the larger oceanic ecosystem. MPAs help to ensure the long-term sustainability of our oceans and the fish that depend on them. Secondly, MPAs help to  . The oceans are home to an incredible variety of life, from tiny plankton to massive whales, and everything in between. MPAs help to preserve this biodiversity by providing a range of habitats for different species. By protecting different types of habitats, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, and kelp forests, MPAs ensure that a diverse range of marine life can continue to exist in our oceans. Thirdly, MPAs  . Many coastal communities around the world depend on fishing for their livelihoods. MPAs provide a way to manage and sustainably use these resources, ensuring that fish populations do not become depleted, and fishing can continue for generations to come. MPAs can also attract tourists, providing a source of income for local economies and creating jobs in areas such as eco-tourism and marine research. By working together to establish and manage MPAs, we can create a brighter future for our oceans and the people and animals that depend on them. So, let’s join forces and protect our oceans – together, we can make a difference!"

That’s where a Destination Management Organization (DMO) comes into play.  A DMO is a body that manages all aspects of a tourism destination. It protects nature and the area’s cultural heritage, while also maintaining its appeal to travelers. The organization brings together government, civil society, and industry stakeholders to secure funding, protect the area’s natural environments, and simultaneously boost its economy.  Here at CORAL, we are actively involved in the development and maintenance of a DMO in Cozumel, which is only the second DMO created in Mexico. Due to the area’s lively coral reefs and a local economy reliant on them, Cozumel is an important destination to protect and a DMO will help us in that process.  Cozumel’s coral reefs are part of the Mesoamerican Reef, which is the second largest barrier reef on the planet. But in the last two years, environmental factors impacting coral reefs, like   and  , along with the devastating effects of the pandemic, have led to a significant decline in Cozumel’s tourism, an industry that accounts for 85 percent of jobs on the island. “Cozumel will only stay a viable destination if we keep its natural environment healthy,” says Javier Pizaña-Alonso, CORAL’s Program Manager in Mexico and the local DMO’s president. “That’s why it is so important that we focus our efforts on protection—especially the protection of coral reefs.”  Cozumel’s DMO is part of a bigger initiative led by our partner,  .  Together, we are uniting the Caribbean’s three major cruise destinations: Cozumel, Roatan, and Belize, in order to preserve Mesoamerica’s natural and cultural heritage. Each destination is developing their own DMO and is working with different sectors to meet sustainability goals and initiatives.  “A priority of these DMOs is to protect all natural environments, including the Mesoamerican Reef” says Pizaña-Alonso. “In Cozumel, the DMO will keep its corals healthy by implementing initiatives focused on waste management, water and sanitation, and climate change.” In order to fulfill long-term conservation initiatives, Pizaña-Alonso is building an ongoing relationship with the local government.  According to Pizaña-Alonso, it is important that members of the local government want to be involved in the DMO, as it makes it much easier to secure the funds needed to support coral reef conservation. “Around the world, successful DMOs that improved the sustainable tourism dynamic were all supported by the local government and private sector,” says Pizaña-Alonso.  This can be challenging when newly elected officials come into power; however, Pizaña-Alonso is thrilled to announce that Cozumel’s DMO is one of few local projects that has succeeded across multiple administrations.  Through a coordinated approach to sustainable tourism, we are optimistic that we can keep Cozumel’s coral reefs healthy and thriving, which in turn supports the many marine animals and people that are dependent on them. "

        "content": "Could a map be used to estimate the likelihood that a coral reef can adapt to climate change? That’s one of the biggest questions driving our Global Conservation Science team these days. In collaboration with the  , a global map and monitoring system for shallow water coral reefs, we are leading new, cutting-edge research to determine the Atlas’s ability to identify which reefs are more likely to be able to adapt to climate change.  CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, Dr. Helen Fox, is spearheading the initiative and working with researchers at the University of Miami and an independent postdoc.  The Atlas consists of different data layers that online users can turn on or off to view characteristics of a reef, like bottom type and reef structure, which is mapped from imagery detected by satellites in space, and then ground-truthed by local scientists around the world.  Scientists, including Fox, predict—and are working to prove—that the areas shown by the Atlas to have a wide range of diversity in reef type and structure correlate to a high range of temperatures on a reef. This would likely mean greater genetic diversity of corals. If that’s the case, then the Atlas could be used to predict which reefs have a higher potential of adapting to climate change.  Around the world, coral reefs are suffering from the impacts of warming ocean temperatures—which is the cause of mass bleaching events and the loss of 14 percent of the planet’s corals in the last decade. But research has shown that some corals can adapt to these higher temperatures. It is important to reduce human impacts in these “hot reef” areas so those heat-adapted corals can reproduce and spread their genes. “As the oceans warm, we are hoping there are some corals that can survive the warming waters,” says Fox. “We then want those corals to reproduce, so they build future generations of coral that are also able to tolerate warmer temperatures.”    If Fox and her team determine that the Atlas can, in fact, be used to estimate a reef’s adaptation potential, the next step will be to use this data layer during marine spatial planning. That would give decision-makers the information needed to help prioritize protections for coral reefs that have a higher potential of adapting to future ocean conditions.  Many countries and coastal regions are already setting goals to increase the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) in their waters. Some areas, like Hawai’i, have pledged to protect at least 30 percent of its coral reefs with MPAs by 2030. Those MPAs could be even more effective if they include coral reefs that could help spread adaptive traits to other coral reefs.   “We are fighting to protect an incredibly valuable marine ecosystem,” says Fox. “The loss of coral reefs will be devastating for the ocean, as well as for coastal communities that rely on them for food and income.”  Since launching last year, the Atlas   in many parts of the world. From Mozambique to Sri Lanka to the Bahamas, the map has supported research and improved planning strategies, in the hopes of ultimately helping preserve the health of coral reefs.  Our work to better understand which coral reefs have a higher potential of adapting to climate change will ultimately benefit these many conservation efforts. According to Fox, acting now is essential as the fate of coral reefs will likely be decided in the next 25 years. "

        "content": "By: Ben Charo, Conservation Science Program Coordinator  If we don’t curb greenhouse gas emissions and slow the warming of our oceans, 99% of the world’s coral reefs are predicted to be gone by the end of this century. Indeed, reefs are already in  . So it might surprise you to hear that within the next few hundred years, corals could adapt, rebound, and survive if given the chance to evolve. The key? Genetic variation.  Genetic variation is the fuel of evolution. It’s also a big part of what makes every individual organism on this planet unique. Even the slightest genetic differences can lead to discrepancies in height, eye color, the probability of contracting diseases, and other distinctions. Organisms with genes that are best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, sending their unique genetic code on to the next generation. This process is known as  . Over multiple generations of natural selection, species can begin to display new traits and characteristics—you’ve likely heard this referred to as evolution.  It stands to reason that the more genetically diverse a population of organisms is, the more diverse its pool of individuals will be, and the more likely that some of those individuals will be able to adapt to whatever circumstances arise. It’s this idea that is essential to coral reefs surviving the heat stress created by climate change.  In an article published in  last year, CORAL team members and partners confirmed that genetically diverse coral reef networks were much more likely to survive warming waters than their less diverse counterparts. The graph (Figure 1a from the paper) illustrates a number of simulations run for the Caribbean region. In the graph, RCP8.5 represents a high-greenhouse gas emissions scenario (leading to a warmer planet and warmer oceans), while in RCP4.5, emissions are stabilized. You’ll notice that corals without genetic variability (V = 0) were wiped out completely with high emissions and barely survived with low emissions. Corals with moderate variability (V = .01) were able to recover in a cooler climate scenario, but perished under the high-emissions scenario. And corals with high variability (V = 0.1) survived regardless of climate circumstances.  When these simulations were run on coral reefs in other regions across the globe, corals behaved very similarly. The key takeaways: 1) genetic variability is critical to coral reef survival, and 2) we must meet corals halfway by acting urgently to reduce emissions. Our research also found that genetic connections  coral reefs were crucial to their prospects. When corals reproduce, their larvae move with ocean currents and can be carried along to other reefs, where they settle and grow. That means coral reefs are genetically connected to one another through flows of larvae from reef to reef. According to our research, coral reefs that received larger amounts of larvae from other reefs were more likely to survive the effects of climate change than those that received fewer. This was especially true for reefs in colder water that received heat-adapted larvae from hotter reefs. In short, preserving genetic variability is important, but so is promoting genetic exchange, especially from reefs that are already adapted to high temperatures.  These findings present us with a few key implications for how we can help corals survive warming oceans. First, we must reduce carbon emissions and slow the rate of climate change to give corals a fighting chance. National governments in countries that   for global carbon emissions must bear the brunt of this work, but individuals can make a difference as well. Second, we must protect a diversity of reefs that are themselves genetically diverse. Doing so increases the odds that heat-adapted individuals will be present and naturally selected. Third, we can’t just protect individual patches of reef; we must ensure that reefs are protected in connected networks to allow the exchange of genes. And finally, we must pay particular attention to the presence of hot reefs in these networks, which should allow heat-adapted larvae to spread to other reefs.  There’s one last piece of the puzzle to coral reef survival: reducing additional pressure from local stressors. When confronted with threats, such as   or  , reefs are less likely to recover from coral bleaching events. We must make sure corals aren’t hit from multiple angles at once by tackling these issues.  Through global conservation science and locally-based efforts, CORAL is leading the charge on making this vision for coral reef survival a reality. In Hawai’i and the Mesoamerican Reef region, our conservation teams are improving water quality, protecting reefs from overfishing, and eliminating as much additional pressure on these ecosystems as possible so they’re able to withstand the threat of climate change.  Meanwhile, our Global Conservation Science team is turning this science into action by influencing and leveraging partners, fieldwork, and technology to drive adaptation-focused conservation solutions that will rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change. Our approach consists of three main pillars:  If you’re a coral reef conservation practitioner, we hope you’ll consider the principles described above as you approach reef protection. And, no matter who you are, we hope you’ll use your voice to advocate for climate-smart policies, and invest in CORAL’s groundbreaking work to save coral reefs.

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "In many scientific communities, “coral restoration” refers to the act of growing corals and then planting them in the wild. While it’s an incredibly popular method of coral reef conservation, research has shown that if done alone, the act of growing and planting corals is unlikely to save coral reefs. For starters, it only works if local threats to coral reefs are reduced. If corals are planted in an area where existing corals are already threatened by wastewater pollution or overfishing, then the newly planted corals don’t have a high chance of survival. Climate change is another concern—as ocean temperatures warm, corals that aren’t heat tolerant will have a harder time surviving. In some situations, scientists and conservationists focus just on planting coral species that are more heat tolerant. But that can be inherently risky, because it means that we as humans are picking the species that we believe will be better suited for future conditions, when we don’t know with certainty what those future conditions will be. In some situations, corals can be bred to be more heat tolerant—these are sometimes called “super corals.” While this sounds promising,   that we collaborated on  in order for these types of outplanting projects to be effective at protecting corals from climate change, they would need to be done at a large scale for hundreds of years in conjunction with efforts to reduce local threats to coral reefs. That’s not to say that growing corals and planting them in the wild isn’t worthwhile—it can be a great way to repopulate an area after a storm or boat anchor damage, for example. It can also be helpful in engaging communities and tourists, and bringing more awareness to the plight of coral reefs. In fact, a lot of our partners engage in coral planting and have found it to yield promising results when combined with reducing local threats to reefs. Outside of specific scientific and conservation communities, the term “restoration” refers to reverting something to its original or natural state. When it comes to coral reefs, that is definitely something we do—and it’s a practice that can save coral reefs. Our programs that focus on securing clean water for reefs and addressing overfishing aim to restore coral reefs to a more natural, healthier state and protect them from human impacts. And our research shows that when we restore coral reefs in this way, they can adapt to climate change on their own—without too much human interference. What does this kind of restoration look like on the ground? It looks like   in Honduras, where we helped the community operationalize a wastewater treatment plant and as a result saw the amount of coral disease drop from 25 percent to zero percent. It looks like   where over 100 volunteers have restored a section of dirt roads by using native plants to trap sediment runoff and keep it off coral reefs. And it looks like  , where we’ve seen a 483 percent increase in fish biomass after partnering with communities to build sustainable fisheries. All of these efforts help restore coral reefs back to a healthier state, where they not only have a better chance of adapting to climate change, but are also more resilient to disease, storm damage, bleaching, and more. There are two parts to this: the first is curbing our carbon emissions to reduce the rate of climate change. There are a lot of great organizations working in this space and advancing initiatives around clean energy, sustainable production, and more. While we still have a long way to go to truly solve the climate crisis, the fact that we are seeing these conversations and this work more amplified than ever before gives us hope. We’re also doing our part by joining public calls to action, sitting on global committees to influence governments that make climate decisions, and using our position as scientists and conservationists to build more awareness around the urgency of climate action. The second part is what we focus on at CORAL: building networks of healthy, adaptive coral reefs. We know that coral larvae can travel for miles before ultimately settling on a reef. We also know that some corals have adapted to become more heat tolerant than others. Therefore, we reduce local threats where corals are already more heat tolerant and in places where their babies are settling, which allows corals to spread their heat-tolerant genes and ultimately change the overall makeup of some coral reefs to become more heat tolerant. So yes, coral restoration that focuses on reducing human impacts and reverting corals back to a healthier, less threatened state can save coral reefs. And in some cases, coral planting to supplement those efforts might make sense, particularly in places where threats have already been addressed."

On April 22, more than one billion people will mobilize and advocate to protect our planet’s beautiful resources, animals, and ecosystems. At CORAL, we are committed to saving one of the most important ocean environments: coral reefs.  Coral reefs are both animals and ecosystems, and they add so much value to our planet. They act as home to more than a million marine species, give protection to coastal areas, and support countless people with food and income.  But coral reefs are in trouble. In fact, we’ve lost at least 14 percent of the world’s reefs in the last decade alone. That’s why we are fighting so hard to reduce environmental threats and keep coral reefs healthy. On April 22, you can stand with our alliance by spreading the word about coral reef conservation and taking actions that protect these valuable ecosystems.  Here are six simple ways you can protect coral reefs on Earth Day It’s hard to protect coral reefs if you aren’t sure what’s threatening them. Spend your Earth Day   to coral reefs and what can be done to reduce this stress. At CORAL, we focus on minimizing overfishing and water pollution—two major problems that can ultimately devastate a reef. Without healthy fish populations, algae can take over an ocean environment and make it harder for coral reefs to grow. And if the water is polluted with waste, marine debris, or runoff sediment, it spreads harmful chemicals and can spur the growth of algae.   to learn more about threats to coral reefs and how you can help protect them.  Planning a summer vacation? Make your plans with the environment in mind! There are plenty of easy ways to make your trip more eco-friendly, like committing to “leave no trace” on the beach or reducing your use of plastic and single-use materials. You can also make a conscious choice to stay at sustainable lodging and support local businesses when visiting a location.  Check out our   for more tips on how to protect coral reefs during your next vacation. Climate change might be one of the biggest existential threats the world is facing—and may determine the fate of our reefs if we don’t make a change. Ocean waters are warming, which increases the likelihood of coral bleaching events. Research shows that coral reefs can adapt to some rising temperatures, but only if we slow down our CO2 emissions.   There are  —including driving less, reducing your meat consumption, buying local, recycling, using less energy at home, and more. And most importantly,   to take bigger steps to reduce worldwide emissions.  Did you know an estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen is deposited into the ocean annually? Worst of all, much of that sunscreen brings harmful chemicals that affect corals’ reproductive cycle, damage DNA, and worsen the effects of coral bleaching. Keep reefs healthy by using mineral sunscreen with non-nano Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide as the active ingredient. And don’t just use it at the beach—sunscreen can easily spread through our waterways and enter our oceans, even if you’re far from the water. To learn more,  If we are going to make a real change, the message needs to be widespread. Use Earth Day as an opportunity to teach somebody else why they should care about saving coral reefs.  Share our  or encourage a friend or family member to follow us on   or   to learn more about coral reef ecosystems. Lastly, you can save coral reefs by directly supporting programs that keep them healthy and thriving.  , you will minimize overfishing, reduce ocean pollution, invest in cutting-edge science and research, and support coastal communities with the skills and resources needed to protect their reefs.  Best of all, from now until April 22, you can double your impact with our special Earth Day match: thanks to our partners at Gili Sports, all donations up to $15,000 will be matched 1:1.

This partnership offers an opportunity to take steps toward reducing water pollution and expanding sustainable tourism programs that protect Belize’s coral reefs.  One of our long-term projects in Belize is setting the foundation for the construction of a wastewater treatment system in Caye Caulker, a small island off the coast of Belize City. This could help ensure coral reefs have the clean water they need, similar to what we achieved in West End, Honduras. By partnering with the local community in West End, we operationalized a wastewater treatment system which decreased the amount of bacteria in nearshore waters by more than 99 percent between 2013 and 2020.  The project was so successful that the community in Caye Caulker is now interested in collaborating on a similar initiative. The island shares similarities to where we’ve worked in Honduras, in addition to having valuable coral reefs that offer food and economic opportunities to the local community.  Right now, poor water quality from an inadequate wastewater treatment system threatens the health of coral reefs, surrounding marine animals, and people in Caye Caulker. By advancing this project, we will begin to implement a better system that benefits both the community and its reefs. Additionally, we are promoting sustainable tourism opportunities in and around Belize City, which will help protect the area’s natural resources and build a culture that prioritizes the environment.  “We are reshaping the perception of tourism in Belize,” says Tanya Amaya, CORAL’s regional program director. “A tourism destination is more than just a place to visit, it is also a community. By building a culture of sustainable tourism, we can also help protect and create benefits for the community, like securing clean water or promoting safety.”  Currently, we are collaborating with relevant stakeholders to establish a  . This locally managed entity would oversee different aspects of the tourism destination and safeguard the area’s natural and cultural heritage. As part of that initiative, we are also promoting an   for tourism operators, which focuses on ways to teach travelers about conservation.  To support both these sanitation and tourism initiatives, we are maintaining the regional water quality monitoring program in Belize that we launched in 2020. Through this program, we have built a network of partners that monitor offshore water quality across 90 sites in the Western Caribbean in order to determine the impact of land-based pollution in high-tourism areas and identify areas that require wastewater and sanitation interventions.  Land-based pollution, often a result of inefficient wastewater management, uncontrolled coastal development, and unsustainable agricultural activities, can bring excess nutrients that spur algal growth. When algae become too prominent on coral reefs, they can block the sunlight that reaches corals (an important source of nutrients) and impact the overall health of the ecosystem and its animals.  “Monitoring water quality in Belize gives us the necessary data to advocate for more sustainable projects and solutions in the region,” says Amaya. “Together with local partners and community members, we are fighting for the health of key coral reefs and supporting coastal communities that are dependent on those ecosystems.”  Thanks to our partnership with the BTB, we are able to push forward these important initiatives in Belize. We look forward to continuing this ongoing partnership and celebrating the success it brings this year."

Predictions from scientists paint a grim picture, anticipating that by 2050, all coral reefs will be classified as “threatened.” Beyond issues like overfishing, pollution, and climate change, an unexpected contributor to this crisis is sunscreen. Unbeknownst to many, certain sunscreen ingredients pose a significant danger to coral reefs. The scope of this issue is alarming, with an estimated  . The good news is addressing this concern is relatively simple. By understanding which ingredients to avoid and seeking alternatives, we can play our part in safeguarding these vital ecosystems. The harmful effects of these sunscreen ingredients extend beyond coral reefs, jeopardizing various marine organisms such as fish, dolphins, green algae, and sea urchins.  are among the issues observed, some of which even pose risks to human health. Nonetheless, safeguarding our skin remains paramount, given the dangers posed by UV radiation.  The initial step toward choosing reef-safe sunscreen is to scrutinize its active ingredients. Brands that label their products as due to the absence of government regulations and mandatory testing for reef impact.  The top two ingredients to steer clear of are… And the following ingredients can disrupt coral reproductive cycles, damage DNA, and exacerbate coral bleaching: This is an opportunity for people to do something simple to help save coral reefs. Studies have shown that chemical sunscreen is toxic and has significant impacts to coral health and their reproduction. By using reef safe sunscreen, you are taking part in protecting the reef into the future.  The term “non-nano” signifies particles larger than 100 nanometers, making them safer for marine life compared to “nano” particles, which are smaller than 100 nanometers. Several sunscreen brands are paying attention and getting it right. Those listed below offer products meeting the criteria of being reef-safe and environmentally friendly, and not just by putting a badge on their packaging. For your next sunscreen purchase, remember to keep it reef-friendly by reaching for these brands:   Wearing protective clothing like   provides effective shielding from harmful rays, reducing our reliance on sunscreen. This choice not only benefits our skin but also  . Furthermore, embracing “reef-safe” habits extends beyond the beach. Sunscreen residue can find its way into oceans through waterways and showers, underlining the need for responsible practices even beyond sandy shores. By choosing an alternative to sunscreen, we contribute to a broader movement that harmonizes our well-being with environmental preservation. As we make these mindful choices, we collectively create a ripple effect that resonates far beyond ourselves, nurturing a world where personal comfort aligns seamlessly with the protection of our precious ecosystems.  Picking up beach litter, reducing plastic consumption, adhering to responsible diving and snorkeling practices, supporting legislation for climate solutions, and contributing to worthy causes are all avenues through which we can protect and preserve these invaluable coral ecosystems. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, emphasizes that   in coral reef conservation. A multifaceted approach is necessary. By continually educating ourselves and taking meaningful actions, we enhance the chances of coral reef survival. Bottom line: the responsibility to safeguard coral reefs is up to each of us. By making informed choices and taking action, we can be the driving force behind positive change, ensuring the future vitality of these remarkable natural wonders."

The network was established in 2013 when community organizations decided they would be stronger working together than separately. Network members meet regularly to learn from and support each other in efforts to protect and restore ocean ecosystems. CORAL’s role within the network will be to provide technical expertise and help implement projects, and CORAL’s Regional Program Director for the Main Hawaiian Islands,  , will oversee this partnership. The invitation is an incredible honor and a testament to CORAL’s—and Mejia’s—history of building collaborative programs to save coral reefs in the region. “It’s very validating that the network sees CORAL can add value,” shares Mejia. “They spent a lot of time on their governance documents and fine-tuned their procedures in order to vet members. All seven community groups examine and vote for prospective members. They need to see the value and the synergy, and you have to be very present in the years leading up to your invitation to join.” Mejia has participated in the network before. He served as a technical advisor through his previous role with  . In an official letter inviting CORAL to join, Network Chair Claudia Kalaola wrote to Mejia, “Network leadership all agree your expertise and collaboration over the years is an alliance we want to continue! Leadership also recognizes CORAL can provide many new opportunities for the network, and we hope you can accept our invitation.” Mejia’s excited to continue working with the network through CORAL, and finds a lot of synergy between his approach to conservation and that of the network. “Things are so siloed in conservation between ecology, conservation science, etc., but my approach has always been biocultural,” he describes. “You can’t take humans out of the equation, especially in Hawai‘i and the Pacific where they are part of the same equation; you can’t consider one without the other.” He also sees CORAL’s collaborative and partnership-based approach as a natural fit, and views this partnership as a win-win for coral reefs. “We will be able to learn so much from each other,” says Mejia. “I’m excited to learn from their experiences working with local communities, and share our lessons learned about how to effectively reduce local threats to reefs. Together, we can reduce local stressors to help coral reefs adapt to climate change, so both our oceans and our communities can survive and thrive well into the future.”"

Their hard work and dedication helps CORAL achieve our mission of uniting communities to save coral reefs. Among this stellar network of volunteers, Charley Dofa stands out as an exceptional volunteer and a local hero. Raised on the grounds of the old Olowalu Sugar Company in West Maui, Charley’s responsibility to mālama ‘aina (take care of the land) began at a young age while helping his grandpa in the family garden. Charley’s natural ability to work the land transitioned into a career in landscaping and later, a heavy machinery operation. Maui has a rich agricultural history with pineapple and sugar plantations, but in the early 21  century plantations started to shut down and many workers lost their jobs. Charley witnessed firsthand how difficult it was for people to afford fresh produce and maintain a consistent connection to the land. “That’s when I became motivated to start a community farm. To help people grow their own food. To make peoples’ dreams come true.” In 2011, with the help of Tova Callender of the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative, Charley started the organic  , of which he is currently the Vice President. “It’s hard for families now because you have to work multiple jobs just to get by, so the garden is a good place to grow what they would need to spend money on. It’s a no-brainer. People start to see how empowering it is to grow your own food. It tastes better because it’s grown from your own heart.” Charley’s knowledge about gardening and farming is a major asset to CORAL’s work. In West Maui, fallow agricultural lands and the design of dirt roads within these plantations creates easy pathways for sediment to travel to the ocean. In West Maui, CORAL’s   Initiative prevents sediment and nutrient pollution from reaching the ocean and degrading reefs. CORAL staff and volunteers like Charley plant native vegetation near decommissioned roads adjacent to streams in fallow agricultural lands, a practice called replanting. Replanting helps to restore ecosystem services, slow and infiltrate the flow of storm water, and plant roots stabilize soil to reduce erosion and sediment from reaching and smothering our coral reefs. Throughout the years, Charley has observed that people and community partnerships are essential for conservation success, which exemplifies CORAL’s mission of uniting communities to save coral reefs. “The biggest impact is when people have the opportunity to get involved in the process. Through working, one learns.” CORAL is uniting the community of West Maui with the help of volunteers like Charley, and recently established Native Planting Days for volunteers to participate in our stream restoration techniques. We want to Mahalo Charley Dofa for all the work he does to support conservation projects in West Maui. If you’d like to volunteer with CORAL, please fill out our Volunteer Interest Form at  .

What does this road a mile from the shoreline have to do with coral reefs? And how can bikers help? In West Maui, water pollution from old dirt roads has led to a decline of coral cover from 30 to just 10 percent in the last fifteen years. Stormwater runoff also regularly causes the Hawaiʻi Department of Health to issue “Brown Water Advisories”, which are warnings to the public to avoid swimming or fishing because of risks to human health. Beach closures negatively impact Hawaii’s natural and cultural heritage, as well as the tourism industry. CORAL, our partners, and volunteers from the community are working to address this threat by planting native plants and deep-rooted grasses along dirt roads that run adjacent to streams. Bringing back native vegetation helps trap sediments and stabilize the soil, while also improving habitat for native plants and animals and creating opportunities for local communities to reconnect with the land. Every month CORAL hosts a Watershed Restoration Day, where a team of volunteers plants native seedlings across abandoned dirt roads. So far, over 200 volunteers have planted approximately 8,000 plants, which are effectively reducing sediment pollution across West Maui. Motorcyclists recreationally traveling along these roads were unknowingly running over our seedlings and sediment traps, rendering them ineffective. When CORAL staff realized this, we decided to create an educational poster asking bikers for their collaboration. The signs explain the connection between these plants and coral reefs and respectfully asks bikers to take an alternative road. The bikers are listening. Since the signs were installed, we no longer find our plants being damaged by biker wheels. We can all do our small part to help, and CORAL is excited to engage this new and unexpected ally in protecting Maui’s coral reefs!"

Jen is CORAL’s Program Manager in Maui, and she’s leading the charge on restoring Maui’s once lush forest to stabilize the soil and protect coral reefs downstream from being smothered by sediment, reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. Jen’s work takes place in two watersheds of West Maui – Honokõwai and Wahikuli – that were identified as “priority watersheds” by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The uphill location of CORAL’s restoration projects tends to surprise people, but what many people don’t realize is that what happens on land has a direct impact on the shoreline. During heavy rainfall, soil and contaminants in watersheds enter streams, travel downstream, and get dumped directly into the ocean. Because ocean currents travel from West Maui’s shores to the coastlines of neighboring islands, these pollutants can end up on coral reefs near and far. The name Wahikuli means “the noisy place” in Hawaiian, named for the sound of rushing water and the loud birds that lived in the cava and breadfruit trees. The forest of native plants once held the soil in place, but now the trees, birds, and water are all gone, and the only sound left is the wind rustling over fallow fields. Decades of commercial farming for sugarcane and pineapple leveled the forest and left a network of dirt roads that provide the ideal conditions for massive amounts of sediment to enter streams and the ocean during rainstorms. Jen’s work isn’t easy. She’s trying to reverse the effects of decades of industrial agriculture by bringing back the forest. She’s also dealing with modern-day challenges, like motorcyclists accidentally running over saplings and monitoring equipment being stolen. Yet she and our team in Maui have made incredible progress, building on years of research by local partners and working groups. Jen leads CORAL’s monthly  , where a team of volunteers plant native seedlings across abandoned roads to prevent erosion. So far, over 200 volunteers have planted approximately 8,000 plants that hold the soil in place and reduce pollution for coral reefs downstream. This work comes at a critical time; Hawaiian reefs are currently experiencing a bleaching event from the warming waters of climate change. But by providing clean water for coral reefs in Maui and across the Hawaiian islands, we can help corals survive these bleaching events and remain a part of Hawaiʻi’s rich landscape and culture."

        "content": "10-year-old Abby Rogers has converted her backyard into a native plant nursery to help save coral reefs. Rogers is a volunteer with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), helping to grow native plants that will be transplanted at their stream restoration site in Wahikuli. The native plants trap sediment that runs off the slope and into the ocean where it smothers coral reefs. Typically, CORAL purchases the plants and hosts volunteer planting days at the stream restoration site. But when COVID-19 restrictions hit and the group planting days were no longer safe, the team put a call out to volunteers to grow the plants at home from seed. “I really wanted to do things for the environment, but had not found a way to really help besides not using a straw or bringing my own bags to the store,” says Rogers. “My mom read about [the CORAL project] in a newspaper article and suggested it to me.” Originally, Rogers signed up to take home three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But once she realized how much fun it was, she signed up for 15 more kits. That brings her total to 900 native plants. Rogers has certainly taken the plunge into her first-ever volunteer project. “I have always been interested in the environment because I have always wanted to help the world,” says the 5  grader. “I spent seven years in China, where I learned firsthand about air and water pollution. Now, living in Hawai‘i, I have been looking for ways I can make a positive impact on the environment.” Rogers is one of 100 volunteers who signed up to grow 25,000 seeds for CORAL. Since not all seeds tend to germinate, CORAL estimates that about 10,000 plants will ultimately be transplanted. “She’s our most prolific volunteer,” says Larissa Treese, CORAL’s Program Coordinator on Maui and the coordinator behind the at-home plant growing volunteer program. “It’s so great seeing the next generation stepping up to save coral reefs—the amount of sediment we’ll be able to trap with the plants she’s growing will definitely have an impact.” Once a volunteer signs up to participate, CORAL provides them with the seeds and instructions on how to grow them. Volunteers can choose whether to donate the rest of the supplies (soil, trays and pots) or whether to borrow them from CORAL. Once the plants are fully grown, the volunteer can return them to CORAL to be transplanted or they can visit the restoration site and transplant them themselves.   CORAL has been engaged in slope restoration in West Maui for several years, using native plants and trees to restore Maui’s once lush forests and reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. The key to CORAL’s success is building strong local partnerships. The restoration project in Wahikuli is a testament to that, bringing together partners like Maui Nui Botanical Gardens, West Maui Ridge 2 Reef and Down the Hatch. “The at-home native plant kits have been a terrific way to bring the community together and keep our volunteers engaged, since we can’t meet in person anymore,” says Treese. “It’s also helped us save the money that we would typically spend on purchasing the fully grown plants.”"

Since then, Earth Day has grown to a global event, with people around the world coming together to protect our environment. Almost 50 years later, our planet and its inhabitants are suffering as climate change causes severe ocean heat waves and   We’ve also seen the   over the past 30 years. These devastating consequences of climate change are becoming the new normal for our time. However, if we come together and raise our voices for solutions in the same way that we did when Earth Day was founded, there’s still hope for the state of our world and its inhabitants. At CORAL, we’re developing and promoting solutions that help coral reefs adapt to the effects of climate change so that corals and the ecosystems they support can be celebrated 50 years from now. Our   address local threats to reefs, including water pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction. Our   research shows that when these local threats are reduced, corals are more able to adapt to rising ocean temperatures. By creating networks of healthy reefs, we can ensure the survival of coral reefs for generations to come. We know that the best way to reduce local stressors is in partnership with the people that interact with and depend on coral reefs. For example, in Honduras, our partnerships with residents, business owners, and the government have improved water quality to meet international safe swimming standards in West End, Roatán. We also partnered with local non-profits to make sure that the marine protected areas (MPAs) that we helped establish are effectively managed and well-patrolled, resulting in increased fish biomass. Efforts like these are  , and because this work is part of a network, these reefs contribute to adaptation and repopulation across the entire Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) system. In addition to this work in the MAR, we are creating the conditions that will help corals adapt to the effects of climate change in Hawai’i and with partners in the Caribbean and around the world. But we need your help!  If we rally together the same way we did 50 years ago, our collective efforts can encourage our leaders, industries, and the world to take action to save coral reefs and our planet’s other vital ecosystems. We’ll be sharing more about how we can save coral reefs together during our Earth Day webinar on April 22 . I hope to see you there!"

You’re enjoying a sunny day in the lagoon surrounded by green mangroves, birds singing to one another and monkeys playing among the branches. In the distance, you see local fishermen making their livelihoods, casting lines and nets from offshore hoping for a catch. Unfortunately, the lagoon is under constant threat from overfishing by outside communities who are not complying with the local fishing regulations. In turn, overfishing causes a decline in populations of the reef fish that depend on lagoons as nurseries for their young. Fortunately, the recently passed Ministerial Decree 108-2017 is designed to protect this vital water source that provides food and income for the surrounding 13 communities. Since 2011, CORAL’s Honduras field team and our partners have worked collaboratively in Tela to encourage communication and cooperation among local communities, organizations and government entities. After several years of supporting and working hand in hand with these entities, the Tela Environmental and Protected Areas Interinstitutional Committee was formally recognized and tasked with bringing together all the key players to protect the natural coastal and marine resources of Tela Bay. In 2015, after successfully creating a  , the Committee started discussing solutions to protect the lagoon from unsustainable fishing practices. After two years of meetings between the Interinstitutional Committee and affected communities, they agreed to new fishing regulations which were passed as a law by the Honduran Livestock and Agriculture Secretariat in April 2017.

Desafortunadamente, la laguna está bajo la amenaza constante de la sobrepesca por parte de comunidades externas que no cumplen con las normas de pesca locales. A su vez, la sobrepesca provoca una disminución de las poblaciones de peces de arrecife que dependen de las lagunas como criaderos para sus crías. Afortunadamente, el Decreto Ministerial 108-2017 recientemente aprobado está diseñado para proteger esta fuente vital de agua que proporciona alimentos e ingresos a las 13 comunidades circundantes.

Her husband rolls into the water after her and hears Jenny scream. He panics: is she OK? As he swims down to her he also starts to yell but they are both yelling in excitement because—astonishingly—the bottom is covered in live coral. Coral cover has declined across the Caribbean, from near 80 percent in the 1970s to about 18 percent today. Somehow, the corals in Tela have defied that trend: live coral cover is an astounding 69 percent. Now six years later, I have a chance to see these amazing reefs for myself. My own journey to Tela starts with lunch in Miami. No, not that Miami—this is Miami, Honduras: a ragtag collection of wooden houses perched on stilts and crowded onto a narrow strip of sand between the Caribbean Sea and  . This lagoon is an important nursery habitat for many species of reef fish. While Tela’s reefs are amazing for their live coral cover, they have a noticeable lack of fish. This has many worried that the entire local system sits on the edge of an ecological precipice. For these corals to continue to thrive, they need fish—especially herbivorous fish who help control algal growth. However, for the reef to have fish, it needs the lagoon. This lagoon also provides essential food and income for thirteen communities that ring its shores. These communities and others exert enormous fishing pressure on the lagoon, which means very few fish actually survive to make it to the reef. CORAL has been working in Tela for the last four years to reduce overfishing in a way that doesn’t harm the lagoon’s human communities. After my lunch in Miami, Jenny and I pile into a boat on the lagoon with some of Tela’s managers. We are on our way to visit one community— —to see how people, the reef and lagoon interact. My first impression of the lagoon is that it is huge: it takes us forty-five minutes to cross it. Mangroves crowd its shores, their barnacle-clad roots sticking up from water that is bright green and soupy looking. Where the edge is sandy, it is full of birds, including egrets, herons and one pale pink spoonbill. As we near the far shore, there’s a young boy waving at us from a sand bar. He stands next to a tree branch sporting a tattered piece of red fabric, which marks a channel entrance into the forest. The entrance is so shallow that the boat has to be pushed into the channel. We slide over sand past thick reeds that crowd into the boat from both sides. Once we are afloat again, we motor slowly into the forest. The view of mountains is eclipsed by large trees and a deep hot hush settles over us. We step from the boat onto a muddy bank and start our kilometer-long walk through the thick heat to Marion. The first thing I notice when we reach the village is an abandoned house that’s half buried in sand. Marion sits directly under a levee next to a river. In 2014, the levee burst and the village was quickly inundated. Not everyone survived the flood and those who did lost everything. Marion is a poor community without running water or electricity. Yet, as we walk down the wide sandy track through the middle of the village and past the brightly painted school, the feeling is one of happiness and joy. Kids play in the middle of the town, people stop to talk to us. It’s peaceful here. We turn left down a small track toward our final destination. We are greeted by decorative palm fronds and balloons. Balloons! Marion is celebrating the opening of a new cooperative store. A $2,300 micro-grant from CORAL has stocked the shelves with bags of flour, rice and beans, pens and Coca Cola. The store’s profit-sharing agreement provides members with an alternative form of income that helps the community endure the fishing closed season and the reductions in catch limits that will be required to rebuild the ecosystem. The cooperative’s members greet us with smiles and hugs, speeches and more than a few tears of gratitude. Such a small thing for us has made such a big difference for these people. They are still recovering from the flood, and opening this store gives them hope that their community will survive. The next day, I head out to the reef. Rolling into the water, I experience the same thing Jenny did six years earlier. I too am yelling into my regulator in amazement: there is so much coral! Even now, two months after my visit to Tela, picturing those reefs fills me with hope. In Tela, corals have figured out how to adapt to and thrive in less than ideal conditions. By including this area in CORAL’s Mesoamerican   —a large network of diverse and connected healthy reefs—baby corals from Tela can travel to other locations, taking with them the special genetic material that allowed their parents to thrive in murky waters. Communities like Marion also give me hope. Earlier this year,   was passed into law in Tela Bay. This approach to fisheries management ensures that each of Tela’s communities has exclusive access to a portion of the catch. What they don’t fish today will be available to them tomorrow. In conjunction with alternative livelihoods—like the cooperative store in Marion—these communities are able to make decisions to not fish. By including communities in solutions that help save coral reefs, we create win-wins that give everyone hope for the future.   ******************** En el año 2011 Jenny Myton, la Directora Regional de Programa de CORAL para la Región Mesoamericana, está buceando en las aguas turbias de la Bahía de Tela, Honduras. Su esposo se sumerge detrás de ella y escucha a Jenny gritar. Entra en pánico: ¿Estará bien? Al nadar hacia ella, también comienza a gritar, pero ambos gritan de emoción porque, sorprendentemente, el fondo está cubierto de coral vivo. La cobertura de coral ha disminuido en todo el Caribe, de tener cerca del 80 por ciento en la década de 1970 a alrededor del 18 por ciento en la actualidad. De alguna manera, los corales en Tela han desafiado esa tendencia: la cobertura de coral vivo es un asombroso 69 por ciento. Ahora, seis años después, tengo la oportunidad de ver estos increíbles arrecifes por mí mismo. Mi propio viaje a Tela comienza con un almuerzo en Miami. No, no ese Miami, estamos en Miami, Honduras: una colección irregular de casas de madera encaramadas sobre pilotes y apiñadas en una estrecha franja de arena entre el Mar Caribe y la  . Esta laguna es un importante hábitat de cría de muchas especies de peces arrecifales. Si bien los arrecifes de Tela son increíbles por su cobertura de coral vivo, tienen una notable falta de peces. Esto ha causado que muchos se preocupen que todo el sistema local se encuentre al borde de un desastre ecológico. Ya que para que estos corales continúen prosperando, necesitan peces, especialmente peces herbívoros que ayudan a controlar el crecimiento de algas. Sin embargo, para que el arrecife tenga peces, necesita de la laguna. Esta laguna también proporciona alimentos e ingresos esenciales para trece comunidades que rodean sus costas. Estas comunidades y otras ejercen una enorme presión pesquera en la laguna, lo que significa que muy pocos peces sobreviven para llegar al arrecife. CORAL ha estado trabajando en Tela durante los últimos cuatro años para reducir la sobrepesca de una manera que no cause daño a las comunidades de la laguna. Después de mi almuerzo en Miami, Jenny y yo nos subimos a un bote en la laguna con algunos de los gerentes de Tela. Vamos a visitar una comunidad, , para ver cómo interactúan las personas, el arrecife y la laguna. Mi primera impresión de la laguna es que es enorme: tardamos cuarenta y cinco minutos en cruzarla. Los manglares abarrotan sus orillas, sus raíces cubiertas de percebes sobresalen del agua, de color verde brillante y de aspecto viscoso. Donde la orilla es arenosa, está lleno de aves, incluidas garzas, garcetas y un pájaro pico espátula rosa pálido. Cuando nos acercamos a la costa lejana, hay un niño que nos saluda desde un banco de arena. Está de pie junto a la rama de un árbol con un trozo trapo rojo, que marca un canal de entrada al bosque. La entrada es tan poco profunda que hay que empujar el barco hacia el canal. Nos deslizamos sobre la arena entre gruesos juncos que se amontonan en el bote desde ambos lados. Una vez que estamos a flote nuevamente, nos internamos lentamente en el bosque. La vista de las montañas se ve eclipsada por grandes árboles y un profundo silencio se posa sobre nosotros. Salimos del bote a una orilla fangosa y comenzamos nuestra caminata de un kilómetro a través del denso calor hasta Marion. Lo primero que noto al llegar al pueblo es una casa abandonada que está medio enterrada en la arena. Marion está asentada directamente debajo de un bordo al lado de un río. En 2014, el bordo cedió y la aldea se inundó rápidamente. No todos sobrevivieron a la inundación y los que sobrevivieron lo perdieron todo. Marion es una comunidad pobre sin agua corriente ni electricidad. Sin embargo, mientras caminamos por el ancho camino arenoso que atraviesa el centro del pueblo y pasamos por la escuela pintada de colores brillantes, la sensación es de felicidad y alegría. Los niños juegan en el centro del pueblo, la gente se detiene para hablarnos. Este es un lugar tranquilo. Giramos a la izquierda por un pequeño sendero hacia nuestro destino final. Nos reciben hojas de palmera decorativas y globos. ¡Globos! Marion está celebrando la apertura de una nueva tienda cooperativa. Un micro-subsidio de $ 2,300 de CORAL ha llenado los estantes con bolsas de harina, arroz y frijoles, bolígrafos y Coca Cola. El acuerdo participativo en las ganancias de la tienda brinda a los miembros una forma alternativa de ingresos que ayuda a la comunidad a soportar la temporada de veda de pesca y las reducciones en los límites de captura que se requerirán para reconstruir el ecosistema. Los socios de la cooperativa nos saludan con sonrisas y abrazos, discursos y más de una lágrima de gratitud. Algo tan pequeño para nosotros ha marcado una gran diferencia para estas personas. Todavía se están recuperando de la inundación y la apertura de esta tienda les da la esperanza de que su comunidad sobrevivirá. Al día siguiente, me dirijo al arrecife. Al entrar en el agua, experimento lo mismo que Jenny seis años antes. Yo también grito en mi regulador con asombro: ¡hay tanto coral! Incluso ahora, dos meses después de mi visita a Tela, imaginar esos arrecifes me llena de esperanza. En Tela, los corales han encontrado la manera de adaptarse y prosperar en condiciones poco ideales. Al incluir esta zona en el Paisaje Arrecifal Adaptativo Mesoamericano de CORAL -una gran red de arrecifes sanos, diversos y conectados- los corales jóvenes de Tela pueden viajar a otros lugares, llevando consigo el material genético especial que permitió a sus progenitores prosperar en aguas turbias. Comunidades como Marion también me dan esperanza. A principios de este año, la   se convirtió en ley en la Bahía de Tela. Este enfoque de manejo pesquero asegura que cada una de las comunidades de Tela tenga acceso exclusivo a una porción de la captura. Lo que no pescan hoy estará disponible para ellos mañana. Junto con medios de vida alternativos -como la tienda cooperativa de Marion- estas comunidades pueden tomar la decisión de no pescar. Al incluir a las comunidades en las soluciones que contribuyen a salvar los arrecifes de coral, creamos soluciones beneficiosas para todos que dan esperanza al futuro."

        "content": "Coral reefs provide an important source of food and income for coastal and island communities around the world. But more than 55 percent of reefs are threatened by overfishing globally. Overfishing not only disrupts the delicate ecology of coral reefs, it also negatively impacts the local communities that depend on them. If fishers are unable to catch enough fish, they may struggle to make a living or feed their families. That’s where bees and chickens come in. Entrepreneurial “income diversification” projects, like raising egg-laying chickens or keeping honeybees, offer new ways for fishers and their families to earn money. When communities have the skills and resources to generate income in new ways, they don’t need to overfish. The result is a win-win solution, in which people are no longer over-reliant on a single resource, while depleted fish stocks and coral reef ecosystems get the chance to recover and thrive. As part of our   initiative, CORAL collaborates with local communities to develop tailored, locally appropriate income diversification projects. Some such examples include our egg-laying chicken project in coastal Honduras and our beekeeping project in Waivunia, Fiji. We help build the capacity of local people to learn skills like how to run an artisan shop or become a tour guide operator — always taking into consideration communities’ preferences and interests and the availability of materials for start-up and maintenance. One of our greatest success stories comes from the Micos Lagoon on the north coast of Honduras. With its natural beauty and high biodiversity, the lagoon is the ecological, social, and economic heart of Blanca Jeannette Kawas National Park. It serves as a nursery habitat where juvenile reef fish spend their lives before populating Tela Bay’s coral reefs. Unfortunately, water pollution, overfishing, and unsustainable fishing practices (like using fishing nets with illegal mesh sizes) have caused overexploitation of the lagoon. In July 2017, Micos lagoon experienced a number of hypoxic events that devastated the food chain, leaving more than 500 fishers and their families without their usual income. Shortly thereafter, CORAL began work with the fishing community of Los Cerritos to create an egg-laying hen project. We partnered with a cooperative of 12 women who are either fishers themselves or married to fishers, and gave them a microgrant for the purchase of 120 egg-laying hens. After a year of construction, learning, and trial and error, the hens are now providing an alternative source of protein for the community and helping them adapt to new fishing regulations and changing environmental conditions (e.g. hypoxic events) in the lagoon. Income diversification activities like this one not only reduce fishing pressure but also engender goodwill and increase compliance with local fishing regulations. Together with scientific monitoring, enforcement patrols, sustainable policies, and education, they are a highly valuable conservation strategy for people and reefs. *************** Los arrecifes de coral proporcionan una importante fuente de alimentos e ingresos para las comunidades costeras e insulares de todo el mundo. Pero más del 55 por ciento de los arrecifes están amenazados por la sobrepesca a nivel mundial. La sobrepesca no solo altera la delicada ecología de los arrecifes de coral, sino que también afecta negativamente a las comunidades locales que dependen de ellos. Si los pescadores no pueden obtener suficientes peces, pueden tener dificultades para ganarse la vida o alimentar a sus familias. Aquí es donde entran en juego las abejas y los pollos. Los proyectos empresariales de “diversificación de ingresos”, como la cría de gallinas ponedoras o la cría de abejas, ofrecen nuevas formas para que los pescadores y sus familias ganen dinero. Cuando las comunidades tienen las habilidades y los recursos para generar ingresos de nuevas maneras, no necesitan pescar en exceso. El resultado es una solución en la que todos salimos ganando y en la que las personas dejan de depender en exceso de un único recurso, al tiempo que las poblaciones de peces ya agotadas y los ecosistemas de los arrecifes de coral tienen la oportunidad de recuperarse y prosperar. Como parte de nuestra iniciativa de  , CORAL colabora con las comunidades locales para desarrollar proyectos de diversificación de ingresos adaptados y localmente apropiados. Algunos de estos ejemplos incluyen nuestro proyecto de gallinas ponedoras en la costa de Honduras y nuestro proyecto de apicultura en Waivunia, Fiji. Ayudamos a capacitar a la población local para que aprenda a administrar una tienda de artesanías o a convertirse en operador de guías turísticos, siempre teniendo en cuenta las preferencias e intereses de las comunidades y la disponibilidad de materiales para su puesta en funcionamiento y mantenimiento. Una de nuestras mayores historias de éxito viene de la Laguna de Micos en la costa norte de Honduras. Con su belleza natural y alta biodiversidad, la laguna es el corazón ecológico, social y económico del Parque Nacional Blanca Jeannette Kawas. Sirve como hábitat de cría donde los peces arrecifales juveniles pasan su vida antes de poblar los arrecifes de coral de la Bahía de Tela. Desafortunadamente, la contaminación del agua, la sobrepesca y las prácticas de pesca insostenibles (como el uso de redes de pesca con tamaños de malla ilegales) han provocado la sobreexplotación de la laguna. En julio de 2017, la laguna de Los Micos experimentó una serie de eventos hipóxicos que devastaron la cadena alimentaria, dejando a más de 500 pescadores y sus familias sin sus ingresos habituales. Poco tiempo después, CORAL comenzó a trabajar con la comunidad pesquera de Los Cerritos para crear un proyecto de gallinas ponedoras. Nos asociamos con una cooperativa de 12 mujeres que son pescadoras o están casadas con pescadores, y les dimos una micro subvención para la compra de 120 gallinas ponedoras. Tras un año de construcción, aprendizaje y ensayo y error, las gallinas son ahora una fuente alternativa de proteínas para la comunidad y les ayudan a adaptarse a las nuevas normas de pesca y a los cambios en las condiciones ambientales (por ejemplo, los eventos hipóxicos) en la laguna. Las actividades de diversificación de ingresos como esta no solo reducen la presión pesquera, sino que también generan buena voluntad y aumentan el cumplimiento de las normas pesqueras locales. Junto con el monitoreo científico, el patrullaje de vigilancia, las políticas sostenibles y la educación, constituyen una estrategia de conservación muy valiosa para las personas y los arrecifes."

But among the goblins, ghosts, and creepy clowns, here at CORAL, there’s a different type of beast that truly spooks us—climate change.  Sure, climate change doesn’t look like a typical monster. It doesn’t have fangs like a vampire or howl like a werewolf. But climate change is real and more terrifying than anything you’ll encounter on Halloween night. In fact, it’s threatening our planet each and every day. Climate change is responsible for an increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, a dramatic rise in sea level, and a devastating decline in biodiversity. It contributes to food insecurity and impacts human health. And for our beautiful, valuable coral reefs—warming ocean temperatures threaten their existence entirely. That’s why at CORAL, we’ve turned science into action and committed to helping coral reefs adapt to a changing climate.   in a temperature range of 73° to 84° F, and most corals are living close to their upper thermal limit. When ocean waters are too warm, in addition to direct threats like overfishing or water pollution, corals get stressed. In reaction to the stress, hard corals expel small, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in the coral tissue and act as their primary food source. Without zooxanthellae, corals get sick and enter a “bleached state.” Their notably bright, vibrant colors turn to ghostly white, and if left bleached for too long, they will die.  According to a   released by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, large scale coral bleaching events—caused by climate change—are the greatest disturbance to reefs. In fact, these events have contributed to the loss of at least 14 percent of the world’s corals in the last decade. Corals have survived for a long time and are known for their resilience. Research shows that corals can adapt to a changing climate if we slow down emissions and reduce local stressors.  In contribution to a worldwide effort, we’re partnering with  , a comprehensive map and monitoring system of the world’s shallow water coral reefs. This new, innovative tool uses satellites to detect coral bleaching in real time—which will be a vital resource to push policies and take urgent, necessary action.  Andrea Rivera-Sosa, CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager, is contributing to the project by working with a global network of field scientists, who will get into the water during a bleaching event to verify what the satellites are detecting in space. “Climate change is a serious issue affecting coral reefs,” says Rivera-Sosa. “This tool provides evidence of bleaching that we hope can be leveraged to decision makers to help reduce the impacts of climate change at the global scale.”  In addition to this worldwide effort, we are also working at the local level to mitigate direct threats to reefs, which make it harder for corals to adapt to climate change. This includes addressing overfishing and minimizing pollutants that enter ocean waters.  There’s no question about it—we have a lot of work to do. Governments,  , and  all need to take urgent action, or risk losing the world’s most valuable and vulnerable ecosystem.  So this Halloween, don’t fret about those silly zombies, witches, and killer robots. Instead,   as we face the scariest monster of them all—climate change.  "

It is well documented that climate change is causing corals to die off at an unprecedented rate, but our study provides tools that offer promise for their survival. Our results show that when evolution is enabled, conservation efforts can help corals adapt to rising temperatures.” -Dr. Madhavi Colton, co-author and Program Director at the Coral Reef Alliance. Predictions about the future of coral reefs that don’t include adaptation paint a grim picture of the consequences of climate change, predicting that rising temperatures could result in a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Our results, however, suggest that management and evolution together can help corals adapt to rising temperatures. The study found that the likelihood of successful adaptation increases if local threats to reefs are reduced through effective management. Effectively managing reefs includes protecting them from overfishing and water pollution, which improves local conditions for corals. Managed areas serve as sources of repopulation over the long term–corals in managed areas rescue the rest of the reef. Importantly, the diversity-based conservation strategies performed well under a variety of assumptions and future conditions. This demonstrates that we know enough of the science to act now to establish spatial management networks that include a diversity of reef types and habitats. With the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste. The study shows that managing reefs to facilitate evolution today and, in the future, can enhance their chances of long-term survival. Managing reefs to facilitate evolution means creating networks of coral reefs where local stressors are reduced and a diversity of coral types and habitats are protected. Conservation planners can facilitate adaptation even in the face of ongoing and unpredictable change by prioritizing diversity in coral traits and habitats. Our models suggest that this is the best chance of helping reefs deal with climate change. “The study shows that we know enough of the science to act- and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste.” -Dr. Colton   The research group is currently developing next-generation models that incorporate network connectivity patterns, using real-world data from the Pacific, Coral Triangle and Caribbean to develop regional conservation plans.

Troubled by warming ocean temperatures and mass coral bleaching events, we launched the Modeling Adaptation Potential (MAP) Project in 2016 to ask a critical question: Can coral reefs adapt to and survive the warming temperatures of climate change? To answer this question, CORAL assembled some of the top experts in coral reef ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation science to figure out if corals can adapt to life on a warming planet and what we can do to help. Scientists from Rutgers University, the University of Washington, the University of Queensland and Stanford came together under CORAL’s leadership to analyze how different conservation solutions perform through time using a suite of mathematical models. The group used models to predict how corals cope with different management strategies and scenarios, as it allowed them to quickly analyze the results instead of waiting for results from live samples. The initial results of the MAP Project were published in the scientific journal   in July 2019, and provide hope for coral reefs by showing that, with the right approaches to conservation, we can help corals evolve to endure rising temperatures. The group found that conservation actions like reducing water pollution and overfishing can help coral health so that they’re better able to take the heat. Many of these solutions can be implemented immediately– and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste. Today we’re acting swiftly by leading the MAP Project team to create actionable conservation guidelines that will be used around the world. CORAL is already using these guidelines to create  , and we recently hosted the MAP Science Advisory Group meeting in Roatán, Honduras to synthesize research into regional coral reef management plans for the Caribbean, Pacific, and Coral Triangle.   to determine where and how to implement their coral restoration efforts to achieve their goal of restoring one million corals across the Caribbean. By partnering with scientists, conservation organizations, and local reef managers, we’re promoting adaptation as a solution for coral reefs and turning science into action to save coral reefs for generations to come."

For the last several years, we’ve been leading research funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and other funders to understand how we can best help coral reefs adapt to climate change. Research by others has already shown that corals have some capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change. But we wanted to know more about how the process of adaptation might unfold over centuries of global warming, so that we could turn that science into action today. What could we do to help this process along? To answer these questions, we partnered with academic researchers to build simulations of reefs and we used them to test how different strategies for protecting coral reefs perform over time. Which strategies were the best at protecting reefs long term? In our first paper published in   in 2019, we reported the need to protect a diversity of coral reefs from local stressors—like overfishing and water pollution. Using our simulations, we’ve been exploring what “diversity” means using real-world data from the Caribbean, Southwest Pacific, and Coral Triangle regions. Our results show that thermal diversity is really important. Our models show that networks of protected areas that include reefs in warmer waters tend to fare better over time. The best explanation is that these reefs contain corals that have already figured out how to thrive in warmer conditions. When these corals reproduce, they send their heat-adapted larvae (baby corals) to other reefs, helping areas across a region cope with rising temperatures. There is one important caveat: these results are based on the assumption that we curb global carbon emissions. If we don’t reduce the amount of warming our planet experiences, even heat-adapted corals will struggle to survive. Now that the research phase of this project is complete, we are turning our attention to translating these findings into action. These results can help us identify the areas that need to be better protected—because in some parts of the world, relatively few “hot” reefs are in marine protected areas. With these new results, we’re in a better position to encourage the establishment and improved management of protected area networks that will help coral reefs adapt to climate change."

Whether you reside on the coast or live hundreds of miles inland, World Oceans Day is a time for everybody to celebrate and learn how ocean health contributes to the overall health of our planet.  Why are our oceans important? It’s a valid question. Afterall, humans live on land…so why should we care about the health of our oceans and seas?  Besides the fact that oceans are home to countless marine species, they also greatly contribute to the health of animals that live on land and provide many benefits to humans. According to the  , the ocean produces more than 50 percent of the planet’s oxygen and it regulates our climate and weather patterns. We also rely on the ocean to transport goods, and it contributes to the worldwide economy through tourism, food, and other industries. Not to mention, communities across the globe rely on fish for protein and ocean ingredients used to make modern medicine.  Despite all of these incredible benefits, climate change and human impacts are causing our oceans’ health to rapidly diminish and deteriorate. That’s why we, at CORAL, are calling on you to help us protect the ocean this World Oceans Day. At CORAL, we focus on protecting coral reefs, which are unquestionably some of the most valuable underwater ecosystems.  It’s estimated that roughly 25 percent of all marine life depends on coral reefs, with species ranging from sea turtles to parrotfish to reef sharks. They also provide food, economic value, and shoreline protection to coastal communities. One major way you can protect the ocean this World Oceans Day is by taking actions that focus on keeping coral reefs healthy. "

One example of this is our work in the Bay Islands of Honduras, where we have been working with local communities to diversify their skillsets and sources of income. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, CORAL and partners hosted a series of workshops to build the capacity of the Association of Artisans of Roatán, Utila and Guanaja. The artisan women that comprise the Association are already skilled in many handicrafts, such as knitting, sewing, painting and jewelry making. Through the workshops, they added to their repertoire by learning bookbinding—a skill which will allow them to create new products to appeal to tourists and visitors. In addition to diversifying the handicrafts available for sale in Roatán, this workshop also promotes best practices like creating crafts using sustainable materials that do not harm protected species or undermine their cultural heritage. While the coronavirus pandemic has caused an unexpected halt to tourism operations, the women of the association continue to practice their craft and develop their skills under shelter-in-place. The bookbinding workshop was led by Arleth Rivera, a Honduran graduate of the National School of Fine Arts who specializes in book restoration and bookbinding. Ms. Rivera is now offering an online course via Facebook Live and Instagram, which will enable the women to continue their learning and training from the safety of their homes. We are also exploring the potential of marketing and selling the women’s products online. Just like coral reefs, human communities who have the ability to shift and adapt in times of crisis will stand strong—and even thrive—when faced with shocks and stresses. The steps we take today to build community and reef resilience will ensure their survival in the future. We at CORAL are proud of the work we do to help our mutually dependent human and ecological systems become resilient to the complex challenges of our time."

        "content": "There’s a certain romanticized notion of what it must be like to be a coral reef scientist: living in a tropical environment with beautiful white sand beaches, snorkeling and diving every day, surrounded by colorful wildlife and pristine turquoise waters. Sounds dreamy, doesn’t it? And for Dr. Antonella Rivera, Principal Investigator for the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) in Honduras, part of that is true. She does get to visit beautiful tropical environments  . And she occasionally gets to snorkel and dive. But the majority of her days are spent studying something that is entirely NOT romantic:  . Dr. Rivera’s work focuses on the world’s second largest coral reef ecosystem—the Mesoamerican Reef. The Mesoamerican Reef stretches about 700 miles along the coasts of México, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and supports millions of people with food, income and coastal protection. In a typical year, it attracts nearly 16 million tourists to the region, bringing much needed revenue—though that came to a standstill in March 2020 when the global pandemic hit. Despite these obvious benefits, the Mesoamerican Reef is currently listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List—largely due to coastal pollution. Lack of proper and efficient wastewater management in the region often means sewage enters the ocean untreated. As you can imagine, sewage in the ocean poses a serious public health threat, putting a significant strain on the tourism industry. In some cases, tourists have sued hotels, claiming the contaminated waters and beaches made them sick. But the sewage also poses a serious threat to coral reefs. “It’s heartbreaking that every year we’re seeing more and more algae on the reef,” says Dr. Rivera. “It’s obvious that sewage pollution is a big problem in the region, but we just haven’t had the data on a regional scale to prove that.” , it brings nutrients that spur the growth of algae. The algae interfere with coral growth and compete with corals for space, and when that is combined with overfishing and the loss of herbivores who feed on the algae, the algae can quickly overcome the outnumbered corals. The sewage also contributes to coral disease, further stressing the reef. There are few efforts in the region to monitor water quality and better understand the cause and effects of sewage pollution. At CORAL, we have a robust   on the island of Roatán in Honduras that started seven years ago. But at a regional level, data collection is patchy and site-specific, and there’s no platform or organized effort to tell the full story of what’s really happening on the Mesoamerican Reef as a whole. Until now. When tourism came to a standstill in early 2020, Dr. Rivera and the rest of the CORAL team saw it as an opportunity. The low levels of tourism provided the perfect chance to understand the effects that visitors have on the inadequate or non-existent wastewater treatment systems in the region. We quickly partnered with the  ,  , and local partners to launch a regional water quality monitoring program and build upon some of the more local efforts that are already happening. The first phase of the program will explore the effects of tourism on water quality. The team will begin collecting monthly water quality samples in the next few weeks at three major tourism-impacted locations in each country, using parameters that will help quantify the impacts of tourism. As tourists begin to return to the region, the team expects to see a drastic change in water quality. The second phase will explore the effects of other pollution contributors, like agriculture, and will use these data to begin advocating for policy changes. Though Dr. Rivera never anticipated this kind of potty talk would consume her days as a coral reef scientist, she couldn’t be more excited to be diving in. “I’m excited about this new water quality work because it’s a way for us to scale up all the good work we are doing in Roatán,” says Dr. Rivera. “It makes me very optimistic that water quality, and its impact on coastal ecosystems, will finally be on the forefront of research and conservation in the region. We’ll be able to make a considerable impact on reef health.”"

        "content": "We all depend on coral reefs. To most, this may seem like an exaggeration, but coral reefs are vital to the livelihoods of more than 500 million people for food, income, and protection from storms and waves. They support approximately six million fishers and are important culturally to many indigenous people.  While you may assume that coral reefs are thriving as millions of people depend on and care for them, in reality, they are threatened by a combination of stressors. In fact, about 75% of the world’s coral reefs are threatened.  There are many global threats to corals such as coral bleaching, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. Primarily, the increasing amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has caused coral bleaching. When water temperatures rise too high, corals expel their zooxanthellae, tiny algae that live inside coral tissue and act as a food source. Corals can survive this event, but they become more prone to disease and can die if bleaching persists. Unfortunately, coral bleaching is increasing as corals are exposed to high levels of carbon dioxide.  In addition, many locations do not treat their wastewater, which can increase algal growth and nutrient pollution.  Ocean acidification also plays a major factor in threatening coral reefs. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide, gradually making the ocean more acidic. Reef-building corals (hard corals) are negatively affected, altering their ability to grow their skeleton and make the foundation for coral reefs. This makes corals more prone to disease and destruction.  These are only some of the threats to coral reefs. Other direct threats to coral reefs include unsustainable fishing, habitat destruction, and land-based pollution.  Even small actions can make an impact. Here are some ways we protect coral reefs:  1. Use reef-friendly sunscreen 2. Reduce your energy consumption: turn off lights when leaving the house or use public transportation  3. Dive responsibly: admire reefs from a distance and avoid touching them 4. Eat sustainable seafood  5. Recycle and dispose of trash correctly  6. Subscribe to the   to learn about their conservation efforts and what you can do to help 7. Support coral-friendly businesses 8. Help spread the word about coral reefs by sharing CORAL’s content on  Another important thing each of us can do to help coral reefs is to educate others on the importance of coral reefs to the ocean and to us.  We can inspire others to develop a love and care for the ocean and coral reefs.  In the words of Jacques Cousteau:   If people begin to love and appreciate coral reefs, they may be encouraged to take small steps in conserving them!"

Citizen science groups are becoming increasingly prevalent across Hawaiʻi, as government and community groups recognize their many benefits. Citizen scientists provide a cost-effective solution for increasing the amount of high-quality rigorous data that researchers are able to collect. Citizen science also increases public awareness and empowers people to make a difference for their island community. CORAL has been proudly leading its own citizen science program on Hawaiʻi Island. In 2017, CORAL began training citizen scientists in Puakō to conduct monthly water quality sampling of six sites along the South Kohala shore, as part of a broader plan to monitor the Puakō reef before, during, and after the transition away from cesspools to cleaner alternatives (learn more about our Clean Water for Reefs Puakō project  ). Our citizen science group collects data on metrics like temperature, bacteria (e.g. Enterococcus) and nutrients; information which is critical to understanding ocean health for the benefit of Hawaiʻi’s residents, visitors and ecosystems. Now, thanks to the establishment of the Hawaiʻi Wai Ola, much-needed water quality monitoring is now expanding across Hawaiʻi Island. Data collected will be provided to the Hawaiʻi State Department of Health (DOH), filling critical gaps in their database.

Each year, about 22 million people visit Quintana Roo, México. The Caribbean coastline offers beautiful clear blue waters, white sand beaches, and easy access to the second-largest reef system in the world—the Mesoamerican Reef. The tourism industry takes a heavy toll on the nearshore reefs. But with our local partners, Amigos de Sian Ka’an and Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, or CONANP), we’re working to build a more sustainable tourism industry. Together, we’re training tourism operators throughout the region on sustainable practices and ways to protect coral reefs. Our partners provide tourism operators with tools on how to work within marine protected areas and how to improve business models as sustainable tourism operators. The trainings used to be in person, but with COVID-19 they are now all virtual. And the virtual format is working—at the September workshop, the fifth workshop in 12 months, nearly 25 tourism operators joined. This year alone we’ve trained nearly 130 tourism operators in Quintana Roo, Belize and Honduras. The workshop follows a train-the-trainer format, so participants learn how to bring what they learn back to their communities and help educate others and create lasting change. Many tourism operators know their marine environment like the back of their hand—but they don’t always understand the resource they rely on. This training is often their first formal introduction to coral reefs and why they’re important. “I’ve been working all these years on the reef, and I always just thought they were rocks and I could step on them and nothing would happen,” says Victor Barreda, one of the participants at the September training. Victor used to be a fisher, but with fish resources becoming more and more scarce and unreliable, he now runs a tourism operation in Quintana Roo. “Thanks to this presentation, now I know.” These trainings not only build a more sustainable tourism industry, but they also help us build a local network of coral reef supporters and partners. These partners will be instrumental down the line in helping us reduce other threats to reefs, like overfishing and poor water quality."

When COVID-19 hit, 10-year-old Abby Rogers was looking for a way to help protect the environment. As a newly certified SCUBA diver, the Maui resident could now see the beautiful underwater world first hand, and her passion for the underwater world was growing. That’s when her mom heard about CORAL’s new volunteer opportunity: growing native plants from home to help protect coral reefs. In West Maui, we rely on our dedicated volunteers and partners to help us restore degraded agricultural lands and stream beds. We use native plants to revegetate the area and trap sediment and nutrients that would otherwise run into the ocean and smother coral reefs. But when our volunteer planting days were canceled in late March, we had to pivot. We started recruiting volunteers to grow native plants at home and hang on to them until a CORAL team member could retrieve them and transplant them, or until it was safe for the volunteer to visit the restoration site and plant them. When Abby signed up, she originally decided to start with three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But she quickly realized how much fun it was—she enjoyed taking breaks from distance learning to check on her plants on her patio—and she soon signed up for 15 more kits, bringing her total to 900 native plants. Abby is one of over 100 volunteers who are helping us grow over 25,000 native plant seeds. Since not all seeds will germinate, we anticipate having about 10,000 plants to ultimately transplant at our restoration site. Not only has the project helped us recruit more volunteers who are spreading the word about coral reef conservation, but it also allowed us to save the money we would have otherwise spent on purchasing native plants from a nursery."

Paola Urrutia, Greissi Lizeth Villatoro, and Ana Bessy Valdez spend their days building relationships with fishers. As our community scientists in Honduras, they travel every morning to popular fisher landing points and meet with the fishers to analyze their catch. They take measurements, ask for anecdotal data, and document all of their findings. The data they collect give us and our partners more insight into local fisheries. They also help local fishers understand what’s happening to their underwater resources. Urrutia, Villatoro, and Valdez are respected members of the communities where they work. They participate in community meetings and report back on their findings. Through their relationships, they’ve created a network of fishers that help support science and understand the importance of rules and regulations. When Urrutia started, 100% of local fishers fished during the closed season. But now, only 10-20% fish illegally. Likewise, Villatoro has noticed that the local crabbing company has stopped buying small, juvenile crabs and fishers have stopped using illegal nets that are more likely to catch younger crabs. All three of our community scientists are women from minority groups who are socially and economically vulnerable. The position of community scientist at CORAL not only provides them with a stable income, but our program coordinators also support them in working toward personal goals and pursuing their education. Urrutia for example, was a community scientist in 2016 before leaving to go back to school. Now that she has graduated, she has returned to CORAL and has taken on more duties. She’s now also supervising the maintenance and data collection from CORAL’s experimental aquaculture project in Tela—a project designed to create an economic alternative for fishers."

In 2018, CORAL began building a local group on Hawai‘i Island to monitor water quality. Since then, Hawai‘i Wai Ola has grown to consist of eleven different organizations, volunteer community members, and scientists who champion water quality issues on Hawai‘i Island. The group’s plan was to launch a volunteer team this summer that would regularly collect water quality samples in Kona, Hilo and South Kohala. Their efforts would bring a more robust and consistent understanding of water quality issues across Hawai‘i Island and gather data that could help inform policy and spur action within the local government. Early this year, they   and started building a targeted communications campaign to recruit volunteers. But when COVID-19 hit, the volunteer program was put on hold and in-person training was canceled. As case numbers continued to rise on the island, it became near impossible to allow groups of volunteers to gather in a safe manner to sample, let alone to be trained. Led by CORAL’s Hawai‘i Island Program Manager Erica Perez, the team quickly pivoted so as to not lose momentum. They began converting their volunteer training program into a digital format so they could still train volunteers. And by June, they had started collecting water quality samples on their own without volunteers. They were able to collect three-months-worth of data at 16 sites around the island before the beaches closed in September, and now that beaches have reopened, they’ll be able to collect two more months of data before the end of the year. The data collected between June and September are a blessing in disguise—the islands were closed to tourists during that time and very few people were using beaches. The low-use period will give us an opportunity to understand what water quality looks like without tourists, an opportunity we wouldn’t have had if 2020 hadn’t presented so many challenges."

        "content": "Do you smell that? It’s the stench of rotting eggs…lingering for half a mile inland from the Caribbean shoreline. It’s a stinky reality of this year’s sargassum bloom, or in other words, the overload of seaweed that is washing up on beaches in parts of Mexico, Honduras, Belize, and other nearby areas.   is a seaweed that floats across the ocean in large island-like masses. While floating, the sargassum has many benefits and provides shelter and food for marine life. But once the mass strikes land, it starts to decompose.  While sargassum blooms are a natural occurrence, climate change and direct human impact have led to an explosion of new nutrient-dense seaweed, all accumulating on the beaches in the Mesoamerican Region. The seaweed grows in the Amazon River area and continues to bloom and move with the current, until arriving in the Caribbean. The combination of increased dust blown westward from mining and desertification in the Sahara, mixed with the fertilizer runoff in the Amazon, and overall warming temperatures has led to the perfect conditions for blooming seaweed.  “The seaweed grows quickly,” says Javier Pizaña-Alonso, CORAL’s Program Manager in Cozumel.  “Under these perfect conditions, blooms can double in size in about 18 days. It can become an issue, depending on how long the blooms drift in the ocean.”  Excess of nutrients found in the seaweed doesn’t just smell bad—it also threatens the health of coastal marine environments. The seaweed is rich in nitrogen, sulfur, ammonium, and heavy metals due to excess fertilizer runoff in the Amazon River, which is a result of rainforest deforestation and increased agriculture. “When the sargassum washes up on shore, it degrades and creates a brown tide. This impacts water quality,” says Pizaña-Alonso. Poor water quality is dangerous for animals in the ocean, including our coral reef ecosystems. , there is potential for excessive algae growth, which can quickly take over reef-building corals and destroy the home of more than one million marine species. Furthermore, too much sargassum can smother coral reefs that are close to the shoreline and impact the habits of other animals. And the environmental impact isn’t the only concern. Too much sargassum may also affect the local economy in Mesoamerica, which relies heavily on tourism. “Travelers don’t like the smell and it affects our beautiful beaches,” says Pizaña-Alonso.  There are a lot of factors involved when it comes to solving the sargassum problem. According to Pizaña-Alonso, in Quintana Roo, the navy is trying to collect the seaweed before it comes to shore. Meanwhile, in other affected areas, like Roatan, Honduras, the government has defined a task force and different sectors are advocating for a state of emergency, which will allow for additional funds to be used to address the situation. Despite some controversy, there is also research and testing to see if it is safe to recycle the sargassum. Some are proposing to turn parts of the seaweed into animal feed or mulch. There’s even been experimentation with the idea of using sargassum to make low income homes, notebooks or shoes.   As a next step, Pizaña-Alonso, would love to get involved with the government’s efforts and offer his expertise in marine science. He is also urging governments, corporations, and individuals to learn about this problem and why it is occurring in the first place. By simply lowering our carbon footprint and advocating for the elimination of destructive tactics, like deforestation and mining, we allow for a more balanced planet, and ocean for all. "

        "content": "Around the world, sewage pollutes oceans, harms coral reefs, and threatens our health. But it doesn’t have to.  By connecting homes, businesses, and tourist facilities to community-supported wastewater treatment plants, we can significantly reduce the amount of harmful pollutants discharged into the ocean.  These systems remove contaminants that contribute to coral bleaching, disease, and reef degradation.   Additionally, community education and government collaboration play crucial roles in maintaining these systems and promoting sustainable practices. Through these combined efforts, we can protect and preserve coral reefs for future generations.    will have outsized impacts on our precious ocean ecosystems. Saving coral reefs with wastewater solutions has clear, tangible impacts, which is why we’re focusing our efforts on expanding this work. Keep reading for ten ways properly treated wastewater can revolutionize reef and community health. This may seem obvious, but it’s worth overstating.  Science tells us corals can adapt to a warmer ocean if they have clean water and healthy fish populations. Contaminants and pathogens in untreated wastewater can lead to increased stress and susceptibility to disease in corals. Wastewater infrastructure helps reduce or even eliminate pollutants and contaminants in the ocean, improving overall water quality. Providing clean water to these areas can help prevent coral bleaching and disease, allowing corals to grow and thrive. Clean water ensures a healthier environment for coral growth and resilience, and the benefits of this are invaluable. Not only does supporting a diverse range of marine species enhance the entire ecosystem, but it’s also a major pillar in climate adaptation. Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine life, and clean water helps maintain the delicate balance required for these ecosystems to flourish. Healthier reefs lead to more abundant fish populations, benefiting corals and local fishing industries. Coral reefs provide essential habitats for many fish species, and cleaner water supports their breeding and feeding grounds. Who wants to swim in dirty water? No one.  Pristine reefs attract more tourists to coastal communities, boosting local economies reliant on diving, snorkeling, and beach activities. Clean water ensures that coral reefs remain vibrant and appealing to visitors, promoting sustainable tourism. Cleaner water means safer, more enjoyable beaches for swimming and recreation. Reducing the contaminants that reach coastal areas ensures that beaches remain inviting and free from health hazards. Reducing exposure to waterborne diseases drastically improves public health in coastal communities. Proper wastewater treatment prevents the spread of pathogens that can cause serious illnesses in humans.Did we mention 80% of coastal communities don’t have properly treated wastewater?  Sustaining livelihoods dependent on marine resources and tourism promotes economic resilience. Healthy coral reefs support industries such as fishing and tourism, which are vital to the economies of many coastal communities. They also act as natural barriers against storm surges and erosion, preventing the destruction of coastal properties and loss of land and saving money on coastal defense measures. Healthy reefs play a crucial role in carbon sequestration by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide through calcification. Corals and other reef-building organisms use carbon to form calcium carbonate structures, which make up the reef. This process helps mitigate the impacts of climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Additionally, the dense and diverse ecosystems supported by coral reefs contribute to the overall carbon storage capacity of marine environments, enhancing their role in global carbon cycling and climate regulation. Wastewater treatment plants and processes create avenues for environmental education and awareness to help foster a culture of conservation and sustainable practices. Clean water initiatives provide opportunities to educate the public about the importance of protecting coral reefs and the role of wastewater treatment in maintaining ocean health. Clean water is essential for the survival of all things, especially coral reefs and the overall health of our oceans. By addressing wastewater issues, we directly impact the preservation of these vital ecosystems. Join us on our journey to better wastewater management by supporting our Clean Water for Reefs campaign and help us protect the future of coral reefs.   and be a part of the solution."

        "content": "How do we decide where to focus our efforts in saving coral reefs? It’s a question we get asked a lot, and the answer is both strategic and deeply rooted in our mission.  So let’s get into it!   – climate adaptation needs, local leadership and partnerships, and the resource needs of communities. First and foremost,   Coral reefs are more than just beautiful underwater landscapes; they are interconnected ecosystems that rely on ocean currents to transport coral larvae from one reef to another. This natural process creates resilient networks capable of adapting to climate change. Take the islands of   (Maui, Lanai, and Molokai) in Hawaii, for example. These islands are connected by ocean currents that allow coral, fish, and invertebrate larvae to travel between them, seeding neighboring reefs. This interconnectedness is the backbone of our strategy, helping us design marine protected areas that support each other and enhance overall coral reef conservation. Our second consideration is the presence of local leaders who are willing to partner with us. Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We work with community leaders, non-profits, and local governments who understand the importance of coral reef conservation and are eager to implement sustainable practices. These partnerships are essential for promoting  and ensuring the long-term success of our conservation efforts. When communities invite us to the table and seek our expertise, it creates a powerful synergy. Together, we can develop and implement strategies that protect marine environments while benefiting local populations. It’s about working hand-in-hand with those who know and love their reefs best, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in conservation efforts. Finally, we focus on areas where coral reefs are in urgent need of intervention and the communities lack the necessary resources to protect them. Many regions around the world struggle with limited infrastructure and funding to effectively manage their marine ecosystems. By concentrating our efforts on these under-resourced areas, we provide the   needed to restore and preserve vulnerable coral reefs. This commitment to working in developing countries highlights our dedication to addressing the most pressing challenges in coral reef conservation. It’s about leveling the playing field and ensuring that even the most threatened reefs have a fighting chance. “Where do you work?” is a multifaceted question for our organization because our impact spans local, regional, and global scales. Here’s a closer look at the different levels of our involvement: In the  , we have staff on the ground working directly on conservation initiatives. For example, the Palancar Reef in Cozumel and the Cordelia Banks in Honduras are just two critical sites where we focus our efforts. These reefs are vital to the local marine ecosystem and economy, and our work helps ensure their health and resilience. In  , our team works on islands like Maui and Molokai, where reefs like Olowalu and South Molokai are key to the region’s biodiversity and coastal protection.

        "content": "Say hello to our adventurous addition to the leadership team! When she isn’t exploring in her overland Jeep, Kristy Ives is working tirelessly to protect the beautiful planet she loves to explore. With over 25 years of experience in non-profit finance management, Kristy brings a unique blend of expertise and passion to CORAL.  Kristy’s love for the ocean began early. Growing up in Miami, Florida, just a stone’s throw from the Florida Keys, she spent her childhood exploring the underwater world. “I grew up boating, snorkeling, and diving in Biscayne National Park,” she recalls. This early connection to the sea sparked a lifelong passion for marine conservation. Her journey took her to the University of West Florida in Pensacola, where she majored in environmental resources. “I chose this university because it had a 1,000-acre wildlife preserve, much of which was beachfront—ideal for my studies.” Now, she lives on a serene lake just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, but her heart remains tethered to the ocean. Kristy’s journey into non-profit finance was an unexpected yet fortunate turn of events. After graduating, she landed a job at the National Audubon Society. “The Director needed someone to help with the budget, and I volunteered. It quickly became apparent that I had a natural talent for finances and budgeting,” she explains. This newfound talent led her to earn a degree in finance, blending her passion for the environment with her financial skills. Her innovative approach at Audubon, where she transformed the budget model and improved fundraising strategies, set the stage for her role at CORAL.  When she’s not working, Kristy and her partner, Sam, spend three months a year overlanding in their Jeep, exploring remote and stunning landscapes. “We take our Jeep, which pulls a small off-road trailer, out into the wilderness. We’re talking public lands where there aren’t people for miles. We actually work on the road, using Starlink for internet,” she says. Kristy is also a passionate diver. One of her favorite dive experiences was when she swam through a massive school of moon jellies and came face-to-face with a manta ray. “It was enormous and absolutely amazing. Manta rays are not common in South Florida, so it was quite a rarity.” Kristy’s extensive background and innovative mindset make her an invaluable asset to CORAL. She’s eager to apply her knowledge and experience to propel our mission forward. “I love finding solutions and fixing broken systems. It excites me to work on a great idea, a plan, and figure out how to make it happen,” she says enthusiastically. We’re beyond excited to have Kristy on our team and can’t wait to see the incredible impact she’ll make. Stay tuned for more adventures and insights from Kristy as she dives into her new role at CORAL! Welcome to the team, Kristy! 🪸"

        "content": "As we mark one year since the devastating wildfires that swept through Lahaina, Maui, I want to share a personal reflection on the impact of this tragedy and our ongoing journey of recovery. My name is Makayla Rickard, and as the Maui Nui Program Manager at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), both my work and my life are deeply intertwined with this community and its vibrant ecosystems. The fires that tore through Lahaina not only ravaged homes and landscapes but also shattered the fabric of our community. For me, this event was more than a professional challenge—it was a deeply personal one. My family and I lost our home, and in the aftermath, we found ourselves displaced, moving multiple times and facing significant hurdles. Finding stable housing has been a continuous struggle, especially with the added challenge of having a beloved pet.  In the year since the fires, our island has been on a journey of recovery—one that is as complex as it is hopeful. The fires left a deep scar on Maui, with over 1,399 homes destroyed and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble.   Iconic places like Banyan Tree Park and the Lahaina public library are back open to residents, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the recovery efforts. The beloved Banyan tree, which was heavily damaged, has shown remarkable signs of regrowth, a symbol of our resilience.   Affordable housing is still a critical issue, and many in our community remain displaced, grappling with the ongoing emotional toll of the tragedy. In response to the fires, CORAL launched the   to provide unrestricted support to local environmental organizations and initiatives. The aim was to empower those who know Maui best—our local leaders, community members, and grassroots organizations—to address the most urgent environmental needs during this time of crisis. Over the past year, this fund has supported a wide range of environmental recovery efforts. One of the organizations supported by the fund is  , which has potted 3,500 trees in 14 grow hubs across Maui and is partnering with master carver Dale Zarella on a series of carvings called “Rising from the Ashes; Spirits of Lāhainā.” These creations, crafted from burned trees, symbolize the resilience and regeneration of our land. Another organization supported by the fund is the  , a grassroots coalition formed to address the environmental damage caused by the fires in Maui. Their mission is to heal the burn scars on the island using bioremediation—natural mitigation methods involving native plants, fungi, and locally-made compost. Their work focuses on making the soil safer for future planting, improving water quality, and protecting the ocean from toxic runoff. The outpouring of support from across the globe has been overwhelming, and I’m deeply moved by the generosity of those who have contributed. When the wildfire swept through Lahaina last August, it left behind a trail of toxic ash, laced with contaminants like arsenic, lead, and copper. These pollutants now pose a serious threat to nearshore health, which are vital to both our community’s economic stability and our cultural identity. Our regional program director, Manuel Mejia, often reminds us of the Hawaiian proverb, “E ola ke kai, E ola kākou,” meaning “As the sea thrives, so do we.” This connection between our well-being and the health of our reefs is deeply rooted in our lives here. In the immediate aftermath, barriers were installed around storm drains to filter out debris, but much of the ash still makes its way into the ocean.   are working tirelessly to monitor the situation. Citizen scientists are using drones to film runoff, and researchers are collecting soil and water samples to understand the extent of the contamination. For example, Dr. Andrea Kealoha from the University of Hawaii has been deploying water sensors that capture data on everything from oxygen levels to water movement, providing a clearer picture of how our reefs are responding.  In the short term, fewer human stressors like tourism might offer some temporary relief, but the long-term effects remain uncertain. There’s also concern about potential toxins building up in fish, threatening food security for many who rely on the reef for their sustenance. As we continue to navigate these challenges, we’re committed to protecting and restoring our precious marine ecosystems, ensuring that they can thrive once again. There’s still so much to be done, but the resilience and determination of the Maui community give me hope. Every day, I’m inspired by the people around me—the neighbors who’ve turned their homes into makeshift shelters, the volunteers who’ve shown up day after day, and the donors who’ve contributed to our recovery efforts. This past year has been the most challenging of my life, but it has also been a testament to the power of community. To everyone who has supported us—whether through donations, volunteer work, or simply keeping us in your thoughts—mahalo. Your support means the world to us as we continue the long road to rebuilding and restoring our island home."

        "content": "Coral reefs are under constant threat from human impacts, and sometimes destruction comes from the people who spend the most time underwater enjoying these beautiful ecosystems up close. For many years, the CORAL team has worked to more deeply understand the tourism impacts from scuba diving and snorkeling so we can use our learnings to inform people across the globe about best practices. Our latest study, published in  , focused on scuba diving in Roatan, Honduras. We looked at the number of divers that different sites can sustainably handle (known as carrying capacity) and how diver behavior affects the reefs. We paid special attention to certification levels and the use of lionfish spears, which are used to control invasive species. After monitoring 180 divers across several sites, we found big differences in how many divers each site could handle—some sites could support 13,000 more divers per year than others.  So, what does this mean for reef conservation? Dr. Antonella Rivera, one of our researchers, explains: “This study shows how important it is to understand how many divers each reef can handle to avoid damaging it. Many factors affect this, including the skill level of divers and how they use spearfishing tools. To protect reefs, we need to regularly assess and adjust these numbers and use this information to guide our decisions.”   The study highlighted substantial variation in the number of divers that different sites could sustainably support. This finding tells a story of the importance of site-specific management strategies to prevent overuse and degradation.   Divers’ behaviors, especially those related to their certification levels, significantly affect the physical integrity of the reefs. Less experienced divers tend to cause more damage, often unintentionally, due to poor buoyancy control and lack of awareness.   While lionfish, an invasive species, pose a serious threat to Caribbean reefs, the study suggests that the method of spearfishing, if not properly managed, can inadvertently harm the coral reefs. This calls for a reassessment of current spearfishing practices and the implementation of more controlled and informed methods. The findings from Roatan indicate a clear need for educational programs, especially for newer divers. Workshops and courses focusing on the ecological impacts of diving can significantly mitigate damage to coral reefs. Educating divers about proper  , the importance of  , and the   can lead to more sustainable diving practices. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of  . The way CORAL incorporates this into our work is by ensuring   use these results and replicate these types of assessments to inform their local management strategies. By regularly monitoring and adjusting the number of divers allowed at specific sites, based on the health and resilience of the reefs, long-term sustainability can be achieved. The study conducted in Roatan offers valuable insights into the complex relationship between tourism and coral reef health. It’s also a clear example of CORAL’s strategies.  We focus on actionable science – deepening the collective understanding of the many aspects of coral reef conservation. By understanding the carrying capacities of different sites and the impacts of diver behavior, we can develop more effective management practices.  Roatan’s reefs, like many around the world, require our attention and care to thrive amidst growing tourism pressures. Through informed and adaptive management, we can ensure that the beauty and biodiversity of these underwater worlds remain intact."

        "content": "For over 30 years, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) has been at the forefront of coral reef conservation. What began as a small group of SCUBA divers passionate about protecting these ecosystems has grown into a global alliance, dedicated to saving coral reefs through innovative partnerships, global conservation science, and community-driven action. Our mission centers around the holistic approach that assesses, protects, and restores coral reefs, allowing them to adapt to the threats of climate change. Guided by NOAA’s definition of coral reef restoration as the “process of assisting the recovery of coral reefs that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed,” our   efforts focus on nurturing ecosystems back to health and resilience by reducing threats. This means our team works threats to coral ecosystems by improving water quality and promoting sustainable fishing practices, while also supporting community-led, climate-smart conservation efforts, resulting in long-lasting stewardship of coral reef ecosystems Coral reefs are critical to marine biodiversity, support coastal communities, and act as natural barriers against storm surges. However, they are under severe threat from pollution, unsustainable fishing, and climate change, with predictions that almost all coral reefs could be lost by 2050 if current trends continue. CORAL recognizes that while climate change is a profound challenge, coral reefs can still adapt—if we reduce local pressures. Through threat reduction in the form of clean water and sustainable fisheries initiatives, we are actively working to restore coral resilience, biodiversity, and community support for long-term reef health. Healthy coral reefs require clean water, but pollution from land-based sources, such as untreated or improperly treated wastewater and sediment runoff, often disrupts this balance. Polluted water causes stress, disease, and degradation in marine ecosystems, making it harder for corals to survive. CORAL’s Clean Water for Reefs initiative tackles this issue head-on by working with local communities to assess water quality, advocate for laws supporting wastewater and watershed management, and operationalize pollution-control infrastructure. Our efforts in clean water management include: CORAL collaborates with community partners to build and manage wastewater treatment plants in critical areas, ensuring that sewage is kept out of the ocean.  For example, in West End, Roatan, CORAL’s support of a local wastewater treatment plant has prevented 29 million gallons of sewage from reaching the reefs each year. In Coxen Hole, we’re advancing efforts to expand this capacity and expect to prevent an additional 49 million gallons of wastewater pollution by the end of 2025. The restoration work happening here is essential for the recovery of our coasts and the survival of marine life. We are enhancing the reef’s ability to withstand climate-related stress. There has been a restoration of the reef because of our wastewater treatment facility as well as a restoration of hope for the community. Sediment runoff from erosion and land development smothers coral reefs, blocking sunlight and hindering coral growth. Through watershed restoration and fishpond rehabilitation projects, particularly in Hawai’i, we’re preventing large amounts of sediment from reaching reefs and preserving these essential marine habitats. In 2025, we’ll begin assessing how this work in Hawai’i can influence other areas in the Pacific Islands with the same threats. Hand-in-hand with our Protect work, CORAL is improving water quality by advocating for strong environmental policies and engaging local communities in stewardship. In Hawai’i, for instance, we introduced legislation to expedite cesspool conversion, a necessary step to reduce sewage pollution and protect both coral reefs and public health. These initiatives are grounded in actionable science, allowing CORAL to measure progress and make evidence-based adjustments to our strategies. Over time, our Clean Water for Reefs efforts have led to measurable reductions in fecal bacteria levels in coastal waters, improvements in water quality, and decreased harmful macro algae that threaten coral habitats. Overfishing is another major threat to coral reefs, as it disrupts the delicate balance of reef ecosystems. CORAL’s sustainable fisheries programs work to restore fish populations and reef biodiversity by collaborating with local communities to establish protected areas and enforce sustainable fishing practices. With community partners, CORAL has established and improved the management of protected areas across marine ecosystems in the Western Caribbean, Fiji, the Coral Triangle (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines),  and Hawai’i. These protected areas serve as safe havens for fish populations, allowing them to grow and contribute to the overall health of the coral reefs. In partnership with coastal communities, CORAL’s fisheries projects aim to enhance fish biomass—by as much as 200% in some regions—thus benefiting both the reef and local livelihoods. Healthier reefs provide a more stable habitat for fish, allowing fishers to harvest higher-quality catches, which helps build a sustainable economy around responsible fishing. Our most recent sustainable fisheries work includes two fishpond restoration projects on the island of  . These ancient Hawaiian fishponds, unique to the Pacific Islands, once supported local communities by maintaining abundant and sustainable fish populations. CORAL has joined forces with community nonprofit Ka Honua Momona in Molokai to restore these ponds, which removes sediment buildup, controls invasive species, and promotes sustainable fishing practices. By reviving these traditional systems, we not only help protect the local reefs from harmful sediment but also honor and support local culture and livelihoods. This work enhances the resilience of reef ecosystems around Molokai and preserves a heritage practice that strengthens both community and ecological health. Our sustainable fisheries work is essential to restoring balance in reef ecosystems, helping them recover from past pressures and adapt to changing conditions. CORAL’s Restore efforts—centered around threat reduction in the form of clean water and sustainable fisheries—are critical to the health and resilience of coral reefs worldwide.  By addressing pollution and overfishing, we’re creating the conditions that allow coral reefs to adapt and survive in a rapidly changing world. Our commitment to science-based action, community engagement, and policy advocacy continues to yield meaningful results, with cleaner waters, healthier fish populations, and stronger reefs that support both biodiversity and coastal communities. Through our partnerships with local stakeholders and our dedication to long-term conservation solutions, CORAL is not only working to save coral reefs but also to foster a global community united by a common goal: to protect and restore one of our planet’s most valuable and life-giving ecosystems. Together, we can ensure that coral reefs—and the communities that depend on them—continue to thrive for generations to come."

        "content": "Nestled within the Gulf of Honduras, the Cayman Crown reef is a unique and critical component of the   system. Recently designated as a protected area, Cayman Crown boasts some of the highest coral cover within the MAR region, featuring live coral cover at an impressive 60% (Giro, 2019). This extraordinary reef serves as a central hub for marine biodiversity, connectivity, and resilience, making it vital for marine life and the surrounding communities that rely on it. The ecological significance of the Cayman Crown goes beyond its coral health. Its distinctive bathymetry supports fish spawning aggregations (FSAs), a process crucial for maintaining healthy fish populations throughout the Gulf of Honduras. With its strategic location, Cayman Crown plays a pivotal role in connecting marine species across various life stages, ensuring the continuity and health of commercially significant fish stocks (Giró, 2019; Pérez Murcia, 2020). The high biomass of fish and other species supported by this reef is essential for the livelihoods of local communities, many of whom depend on these resources for their economic well-being. With generous support from the  , through the MAR Fish Project, CORAL and MAR Fund have partnered to formally understand and mitigate the impact of the closure of the  Cayman Crown Reef as a key Fish Spawning Aggregation site. By legally protecting this reef and the livelihoods that depend on it, we are working to safeguard its biodiversity and the crucial fish stocks it supports, reducing pressures on the ecosystem and fostering sustainable fishing practices in nearby communities. This pilot project has been built upon CORAL’s ongoing efforts to support fishers and coastal communities throughout the Honduran Caribbean. Our team has accumulated a valuable socio-economic database across 33 fishing communities in the region, enabling us to develop tools that promote sustainable fisheries management and livelihood diversification strategies. These insights, combined with CORAL and MAR Fund’s establishment of a socioeconomic baseline for Honduran fishers at Cayman Crown, set a robust foundation for crafting sustainable solutions for both the reef and the communities that rely on it. One of our biggest learnings during the implementation of the project was to know the willingness of fishing communities to learn and change. The communities are understanding the importance of developing projects to diversify their livelihoods that implement sustainable practices to conserve and recover marine ecosystems. They know that the sustainable use of natural resources is a legacy that transcends generations and shapes a future in which both people and the planet can thrive. The Cayman Crown initiative is structured around strengthening local fishers by equipping them with the resources and knowledge needed to diversify their income sources beyond fishing. We recognize that effective conservation requires addressing the economic needs of local communities. To this end, our project prioritizes capacity strengthening and the development of alternative livelihoods that support both marine conservation and economic resilience. Through these focused efforts, we have successfully strengthened fishers’ associations in two key Honduran communities, equipping them with leadership skills, fund management expertise, and sustainable tourism practices. This achievement has laid the foundation for a network of legally recognized fishers’ associations, now poised to drive forward livelihood diversification strategies. By enhancing their resilience, these communities are better prepared to move beyond fishing as their only source of income. CORAL has worked hand-in-hand with local fishers to develop and launch three livelihood diversification projects, complete with technical, logistical, and financial backing. These projects are creating sustainable economic avenues that benefit both the reef ecosystem and local communities. As these initiatives take hold, fishers are transitioning to resilient economic models that promise to lessen their dependence on fishing, helping to safeguard marine biodiversity while supporting local prosperity. With transparency and community connection at our core, we’ve documented each phase of our work, sharing stories, visuals, and infographics that capture the impact of these efforts on local livelihoods and conservation. Our multi-language communication strategy—offered in English, Spanish, and Garifuna—ensures that every community member, as well as global supporters, can appreciate the meaningful outcomes of these projects. Together, through collaboration, capacity strengthening, and innovative livelihood strategies, we are working to ensure that Cayman Crown continues to thrive as a vital marine habitat—and a source of opportunity for generations to come."

Although challenges remain, the recent   shows a slight yet encouraging increase in reef health across the region due to an increase in fish biomass likely resulting from improved enforcement. This marks the first reported improvement in five years, thanks largely to the collaborative conservation efforts among coastal communities and organizations like CORAL.  Our data-driven approach is supporting these communities in building lasting resilience for coral reefs and strengthening our understanding of how to manage these ecosystems effectively in the face of climate change. Using data collected from almost 300 monitoring sites spanning 1,000 kilometers and four countries, the HRI Report Card serves as a crucial health assessment for reefs in the MAR region. Data is collected using the Atlantic Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) reef monitoring methodology and assesses coral health based on four key indicators: live coral cover, fleshy macroalgal cover, herbivorous fish biomass, and commercially important fish biomass. Instead of simply reviewing the data, CORAL uses the findings to inform and adjust our strategies in ways that support and build the capacity of coastal communities. These data help us measure what’s working and what needs further action, allowing us to take targeted steps that enhance reef resilience and community benefits. The 2024 HRI report highlights improvements in herbivorous fish populations, like parrotfish and surgeonfish, in the Bay Islands of Honduras (except Guanaja), where these crucial species thrive in MPAs protected from overfishing. However, herbivore biomass dipped in coastal Honduras, where they are not yet fully safeguarded. CORAL is collaborating with the Fisheries Directorate and local partners to push for a nationwide legal decree to protect herbivorous fish across all of Honduras. By supporting community-led initiatives, sustainable fishing practices, and improved water quality, we aim to create a resilient reef ecosystem for future report cards. This connection between community-driven fisheries management and ecological resilience is at the core of CORAL’s approach. CORAL uses the findings from the HRI Report Card to validate our current strategies and refine and adapt our methods alongside our community partners.  With each report, we can track shifts in reef health, fish populations, and water quality, giving local leaders and fishers a clearer picture of the outcomes of their efforts. This insight allows us to support communities in real time, helping them implement targeted solutions proven to enhance reef health, such as expanded MPA networks and refined water treatment projects under our   initiative. For example, in 2024, Coxen Hole saw a dramatic increase in wastewater treatment investment and will continue to see more in 2025. This is desperately needed after seeing the impacts of untreated/poorly treated wastewater on the area’s beloved reef, Cordelia Banks, which was unable to recover from a devastating bleaching event. The severe mortality of this magnificent reef occurred just after the data collection period ended for this report card. The recent data underscore the impact of collaborative action and reinforce the importance of sustained community engagement and data transparency. As our understanding of these ecosystems grows, we can offer increasingly precise and effective tools to local organizations, amplifying their capacity to maintain resilient reef ecosystems. The HRI Report Card highlights the strength of collaborative conservation and informed action. By pairing community-driven MPA management with conservation science, we are creating a future where reefs and coastal communities can thrive together. The road to reef resilience is challenging, but each bit of data shows us the way forward, with communities and organizations like CORAL united in purpose and action.  With our shared dedication and a commitment to adaptive, community-led strategies, the MAR is on a promising path towards sustained reef health, biodiversity, and resilience. This year’s report encourages us all to continue strengthening these partnerships, knowing that together, we can create a future where coral reefs and the communities that depend on them can thrive side by side."

        "content": "Coral reefs are powerful yet vulnerable ecosystems, rich in biodiversity but increasingly at risk in a changing world. Here at the Coral Reef Alliance, our team advances science to assess the adaptive capacity of corals, protect diverse reef networks, and restore marine ecosystems by influencing management and policy decisions.  Through scientific research, we work to understand how coral reefs can adapt in the face of climate change and translate our findings into data-driven solutions. Coral reefs support coastal communities, act as natural barriers against storm surges, and are critical to marine biodiversity. However, they are severely threatened by pollution, unsustainable fishing, and climate change, with predictions that almost all coral reefs could be lost by 2050 if current trends continue.  CORAL recognizes that climate change is a profound challenge for reefs and that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be key to their survival.  However, though climate change is a global problem, strategic local protection is still critical to maximizing the probability of coral reef survival and recovery.    Over almost a decade of scientific research, CORAL and its partners have shown that protecting connected networks of genetically diverse reefs is critical to ensuring their survival and recovery.   Organisms with genes that are best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, sending their unique genetic code on to the next generation. This process is known as natural selection. Over multiple generations of natural selection, species can evolve, displaying new traits and characteristics. And the more genetically diverse a population of organisms is, the more likely some of those individuals will be able to adapt to whatever circumstances arise. It’s this idea that is essential to coral reefs surviving the heat stress created by climate change.  Through simulating coral reef survival under different climate scenarios, we’ve shown that genetically diverse coral reef networks are much more likely to survive warming waters than their less diverse counterparts. Our research has also found that genetic connections between coral reefs (e.g. via currents that carry coral larvae) are crucial to their prospects because genetic exchange, especially from reefs that are already adapted to high temperatures, can enhance the odds of resilience. First, we must reduce carbon emissions and slow the rate of climate change to give corals a fighting chance. Second, we must protect a diversity of reefs that are themselves genetically diverse. Doing so increases the odds that heat-adapted individuals will be present and naturally selected. Third, we can’t just protect individual patches of reef; we must ensure that reefs are protected in connected networks to allow the exchange of genes. And finally, we must pay particular attention to the presence of hot reefs in these networks, which should allow heat-adapted larvae to spread to other reefs. Despite the importance of genetic variation in coral reef resilience, approaches to reef management often fail to account for evolutionary criteria. This is because assessing coral reef genetic diversity is costly and requires expertise that many practitioners do not have available.  CORAL is working closely with partners to evaluate whether we can estimate coral reef genetic diversity and adaptive capacity from remotely sensed data. As we develop adequate proxies, we can then scale these up, creating a globally applicable tool, which we’re aiming to launch in 2025. Making this information easily and freely accessible worldwide would catalyze its incorporation into coral reef management and marine spatial planning processes as part of countries’ 30×30 commitments. Our Global Conservation Science team’s goal is to influence and leverage partners, fieldwork, and technology to drive adaptation-focused conservation solutions that will rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change.  This biodiversity hotspot is home to 76% of the world’s coral species and supports the livelihoods of millions through fishing, tourism, and coastal protection services. As part of the Climate REEFS initiative (Integrating Risks, Evolution, and socio-Economics for Fisheries Sustainability)—a multi-million dollar collaboration of partners in the USA, UK, Indonesia, and the Philippines—CORAL is working to develop techniques to identify adaptive reefs using remote sensing technologies. The ultimate goal of this effort is to develop a freely available, online tool that can identify genetically diverse reefs across the globe. In-country Climate REEFS partners hope to work with relevant government bodies in Indonesia and the Philippines to co-create revised provincial and national-level marine management plans that reflect our findings. CORAL also developed an international consortium of conservationists, ecologists, and computer scientists with a shared interest in evaluating whether we can measure coral reef diversity and adaptive capacity from space. Through examining relationships between measures of diversity (e.g. species diversity, genetic diversity, and others) and remotely sensed metrics at a series of pilot sites, this group strives to identify the best proxies for reef measures of adaptive potential—work that complements the research undertaken by Climate REEFS.  Our members’ research encompasses a range of approaches and spans three oceans: the Pacific, including sites in the North (e.g., Hawai’i, Palau, and Republic of the Marshall Islands), South (e.g., Fiji), and Indo-west Pacific (e.g., Indonesia and the Philippines), the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean (Mozambique), and the Atlantic (e.g., Honduras and the Turks and Caicos Islands). Last year, for instance, CORAL contributed to the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Target 3 Partnership Meeting in Cambridge, which aimed to coordinate implementation efforts of the Post-2020 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and build technical capacity. The guidelines developed at this meeting and ones like it will inform conservation approaches for diverse ecosystems everywhere on Earth.  CORAL has also recently been accredited by the UN Environment Programme, co-published seven high-impact scientific papers over the last seven years, and shared its findings at multiple high-profile conferences and events.  Notably, in 2023, CORAL further expanded its reach by securing two CORAL Fellows, one of whom is supporting Pacific Coral Triangle countries, based in Honiara, and one of whom is supporting Southeast Asian countries in the Coral Triangle, based in Manado at the Regional Secretariat of the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security. These locally-based consultants are contributing to a climate risk assessment for Coral Triangle reefs as well as a policy analysis that aims to inform fisheries management by reviewing gendered climate vulnerability and climate risks. By working to create readily available tools and resources that enable practitioners in under-resourced settings to incorporate genetic diversity into their coral reef conservation approaches, we’re working to improve the odds that coral reefs will survive and recover in a rapidly changing world.  Our commitment to understanding how we can help corals adapt continues to yield meaningful results. Over the last few years, we’ve successfully co-authored multiple successfully funded research projects, expanded our work to the Coral Triangle (a hub of coral reef biodiversity), and continued to form and strengthen partnerships that help us magnify our international impact. CORAL is not only working to save coral reefs but also to foster a global community united by a common goal: to protect and restore one of our planet’s most valuable and life-giving ecosystems. Together, we can ensure coral reefs—and the communities that depend on them—continue to thrive for generations to come."

        "content": "New Executive Director   is making a splash in the world of marine conservation through her leadership at CORAL and immense dedication to saving the world’s coral reefs.  When she’s not rereading “Lord of the Rings” or rooting for her favorite college basketball team, Starck is scuba diving to some of the world’s most valuable coral reef ecosystems and strategizing on the best ways to protect them.  We had a chance to sit down with Starck to learn more about her passion for saving coral reefs and how she will continue to propel CORAL forward through effective conservation strategies, investment in science, community engagement, and impactful partnerships. Here’s what she had to say:  I spent a great deal of time as a child outside exploring and finding wonder in the world around me. In high school, I took my first trip to Andros in the Bahamas and I never looked back. As soon as I was able to get SCUBA certified and spend time exploring our underwater world, I realized I had to get involved in helping to protect it. We are all inextricably connected. Our fates are intertwined. I want a healthy thriving planet for my family and for us all, and that is only possible with healthy coral reefs!    My favorite reef experience was probably the first time I went diving in Cozumel, Mexico. It was in the late 90’s and I remember experiencing the incredible diversity of corals and fish that I had never seen before. The drift dives there allow you to just float and watch this amazing world go by as if you are flying. I remember watching a yellowhead jawfish carefully carrying shells and small rocks in its mouth to arrange its burrow. This was also the first time I saw a parrotfish sleeping in its cocoon “sleeping bag” of mucus at night. I remember thinking how busy the coral reef was and how all of the organisms seemed to be working together in harmony, all with a purpose. It made one feel small but also somehow connected. It was the first time I felt like I understood how we are all interconnected.   I could not be more thrilled to join the CORAL team. The staff, board, council members, partners, donors, and volunteers are some of the most passionate and inspiring people I have ever met. Our science is innovative and important to leading us to our conservation.  Our program staff understand how to put communities first and build trust through relationships. I am excited to make a difference, our work is important, urgent, and our team is up for the challenge. Each and every team member is fabulous!   I have continued to learn and grow as a leader over the years. I would describe myself as someone with a high level of self-awareness that works hard to be honest, transparent, vulnerable, and build and maintain connections. I prioritize being present, participating, guiding, mentoring, and coaching our team to be efficient and effective. I enjoy pushing our strategy forward to reach our mission and ensuring that our team has the resources they need to move past any obstacle. Ensuring that everyone can come to work each day as their entire authentic selves as well as set boundaries for a healthy balance for their specific work/life situation is something I also care deeply about as a leader.  I am committed to our mission, it is deeply personal to me. I am also committed to relationships with you as partners and supporters. I come from a huge family, I have 8 siblings and 31 nieces and nephews. Family is everything to me. I look forward to getting to know all of my CORAL “family”.  Conservation is about people and building relationships. We need to work on solutions that are built from listening to the communities that have lived and thrived there for multiple generations. They have a deep connection with their surroundings and understand the problems and solutions better than anyone. Conservation works best when we listen, learn, and work together on solutions that will benefit both people and the natural world as we are all connected. This sounds simple, yet I have seen so many projects fail by not doing this well.   As the staff, board, partners, volunteers, and I continue to move forward, we will be looking for opportunities to take the lessons we have learned and drive action. Our strategy of working at the local, regional, and global scale will remain important. We have learned quite a bit about what works and doesn’t work in coral reef conservation in communities and our science is giving us more information and planning tools. Moving forward, we will need to focus even more on the “alliance” in our name to ensure that what we have learned that works is being utilized in as many places as possible through partnerships and coalitions. "

        "content": "Over 20 tons of sediment has been captured in the mountains above Lahaina, the result of a collaborative restoration project led by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL). West Maui is laden with historic sugarcane and pineapple plantations that are now out-of-use. During heavy rain events, the potentially contaminated soil from these degraded landscapes travels down old dirt roads, enters stream gulches, and ultimately reaches the ocean where it  . CORAL uses native plants—and over 100 supportive volunteers—to   and trap the sediment before it has a chance to runoff into the ocean. “This past year alone, our restoration projects have trapped over 20 tons of sediment that would have ultimately ended up on our coral reefs,” says Jen Vander Veur, CORAL’s Senior Program Manager on Maui. “That’s the equivalent weight of 10 cars. It’s so great seeing all of our hard work pay off.” And that’s just the beginning—as the plants grow and the sediment traps continue to accumulate materials, their efficiency will grow. “Ultimately, as our traps collect sediment, that sediment will fill in openings and slow the stormwater even further, trapping more sediment, and so on and so on,” says Vander Veur. “And the more sediment we can keep off of Maui’s reefs the better.” Most   are hosts to zooxanthellae, tiny algae with which they share  . Corals provide the algae with protected environments, and in exchange, the algae use the sun to photosynthesize and produce oxygen, and help the corals remove waste. When sediment is dumped on a coral, it blocks out the necessary sunlight to support this process and corals ultimately die. West Maui’s coral reefs are important sources of coral larvae that replenish reefs across Maui, Lanai and Molokai. Because of this, the area has been designated a priority conservation site by the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force and the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources. But a 2012 Wahikuli-Honokowai Watershed Management Plan prepared for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program identified erosion from degraded agricultural lands as a major threat to these vital coral reef ecosystems. Funded in part by the Hawai‘i Department of Health, CORAL’s program is part of   who are working to restore these lands and stabilize the slope. “It’s great that there is such strong community and governmental support to protect these reefs,” says Vander Veur. “Even with COVID putting a pause to our in-person volunteer planting days, our volunteers have continued to keep this project moving forward. Over 100 volunteers are growing native plants from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that number continues to grow. Once grown, volunteers drop their plants off at a greenhouse space donated to CORAL by Pacific Biodiesel, where they stay until they are ultimately planted at the restoration sites.

        "content": "A new dataset, made public this month by Hawai’i Wai Ola, gives community members access to high quality, open-source water quality testing data dating back to June of 2020. Volunteers and members of  —a local community hui founded by the   to improve water quality—have taken monthly water quality samples at popular sites around Hawai’i Island, including Kahalu’u Bay, Richardson Beach Park, Carlsmith Beach Park, Puhi Bay Beach, Reeds Bay Beach and Moku Ola Beach. The new dataset includes metrics from these locations on pH, salinity, temperature, turbidity, nutrients and enterococcus levels—commonly used indicators of sewage pollution in nearshore ocean environments.  “The fact that we have this data set is incredibly exciting,” says Erica Perez, senior program manager at the Coral Reef Alliance and founding member of Hawai’i Wai Ola. “These are sites that aren’t tested by the Department of Health (DOH), so this is the first time this information is being made available to people.”  While DOH regularly tracks water quality throughout the state, their resources are limited and as a result, there are critical knowledge gaps in the information they collect.  “DOH can’t take action to address poor water quality if they don’t know when the water quality is poor,” says Perez. “The purpose of our program at Hawai’i Wai Ola is to empower local communities to work alongside DOH and help expand their understanding of ocean water quality and overcome their resource barriers.” For example, this new data shows several beaches have experienced unhealthy enterococcus levels over the last year and a half. Richardson Beach Park measured 1119 CFU per 100 mL in August of 2020—that’s nearly nine times higher than the levels considered healthy by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Hawai’i Department of Health issues an alert for any area experiencing levels of 104 CFU per 100 mL or above for a single sample.  But Perez warns that it’s important not to jump to conclusions when noticing one-off data points like this, and instead to focus on the fact that the community near Richardson Beach Park can now work with DOH to identify if there’s a bigger problem and find a resolution.  “These are one-time sampling events that happen once a month, so they don’t necessarily give the full story,” says Perez. “Enterococcus levels can change rapidly based on tides, currents, weather events, etc. It could rain and cesspools could leach into the groundwater and into the shoreline, and then it could be gone the next day. So these levels aren’t always an indicator of an ongoing problem.”  The hui is working with the community to ensure they know about this new resource and they have shared the dataset with DOH so they can conduct a more thorough analysis. This new knowledge will be included in DOH’s bi-annual ocean beach health report that they use to identify areas of concern and strategize.  The whole program and the fact that this data now exists highlights the power of citizen science networks, says Manuel Mejia, the Hawai’i regional program director for the Coral Reef Alliance. Hawai’i Wai Ola and the Coral Reef Alliance are working to train community volunteers to collect water quality samples following DOH protocols. Volunteers will then bring the samples to a water quality lab in Kona for analysis.  “We can’t manage what we can’t measure,” says Mejia. “But we can give communities the tools they need to start measuring, and to advocate for an improvement in water quality which is so desperately needed across our islands. Allowing local communities to have more ownership over their resources and to have a say over how they’re utilized is invaluable.”  The new dataset can be viewed online at hawaiiwaiola.com/data.   The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is committed to saving the world’s coral reefs. The nonprofit organization works at local, regional and global levels to keep coral reefs healthy so they can adapt to climate change and survive for generations to come.

Launched on the eve of the Our Ocean Conference in Palau,   is a user-friendly, open-access platform poised to revolutionize global coral reef monitoring and management by allowing the world’s coral reef monitoring community to work together, in real time. ReefCloud standardizes data collected from around the world, analyzing coral reef composition with 80-90 percent accuracy, 700 times faster than traditional manual assessment, saving weeks and months of labour and freeing precious reef management resources. It was developed by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in collaboration with Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Fiji, the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), University of South Pacific, Queensland University of Technology, Marine Ecology Consulting, Maldives Marine Research Institute and CO2 Consulting, with in kind support from Accenture, Speaking at the launch at PICRC, Australian Ambassador for the Environment Jamie Isbister said ReefCloud brought a transformative change to the way we monitored our coral reefs and came at a critical time for global reef protection. It also included engagement with indigenous communities, many of whom play a key role in marine monitoring. “Coral reefs are rapidly declining, with climate change being their single greatest threat globally,” Mr Isbister said. “This platform is going to address key challenges by helping coral reef managers assess the condition of their reefs and take appropriate management actions.” AIMS Research Team Lead and ReefCloud Director Dr Manuel Gonzalez Rivero said ReefCloud was the “democratization of knowledge”. “We’re partnering with the   to support a transformation in coral reef monitoring,” he said.  “Last year, GCRMN released a   which involved integrating reef monitoring efforts from 12,000 coral reef sites in 73 countries. With limited human resources it took years to painstakingly reconcile inconsistent data formats and methodologies. ReefCloud can automate that process, providing up-to-date information within hours, which leads to more timely and informed decisions on actions to improve the long-term sustainability of our coral reefs.” ReefCloud is a A$6.6M program, jointly funded by AIMS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).

        "content": "A   shows that a popular coral restoration technique is unlikely to protect coral reefs from climate change, and is based on the assumption that local threats to reefs are managed effectively. The research, published in the  , used innovative models to explore the response of coral reefs to restoration projects that propagate corals and outplant them into the wild. Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of outplanting corals genetically adapted to warmer temperatures, sometimes called ‘super corals,’ to reefs experiencing climate change as a way to build resilience to warming. The models found that neither approach was successful at preventing a decline in coral coverage in the next several hundred years due to climate change, and that selectively breeding corals to be more heat tolerant will only lead to benefits if conducted at a very large scale over the course of centuries. Even then, benefits won’t be realized for 200 years. Restoring areas with corals that haven’t been selected to be more heat tolerant was ineffective at helping corals survive climate change except at the largest supplementation levels explored. “The scenarios where coral reefs showed the greatest resilience to climate change were those where natural genetic variance was highest, and outplanting heat-tolerant corals in those areas had little to no effect on outcomes,” says Dr. Lukas DeFilippo, who co-led this research as a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington, and is now a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  “Our previous research shows that corals have the best chance of adapting to the effects of climate change, like warming ocean temperatures, if there is high genetic diversity and if habitat is protected from other local stressors.” says Dr. Lisa McManus, the other co-lead, who conducted this work as a postdoctoral researcher  at Rutgers University and is now faculty at the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology. “Repopulating a coral reef with corals that have similar genetic makeups could reduce an area’s natural genetic diversity, and therefore make it harder for all corals to adapt to climate change.”  Coral reef restoration techniques are widely applied throughout the world as a way to repopulate degraded coral reef areas. Though the practice has some benefits, like engaging and educating communities about reef ecosystems, or replenishing a coral reef population after an area has been hit by a storm or suffered direct physical damage, more scientists are speaking up about the limitations of conservation approaches that focus solely on restoration.  “There’s a time and place for coral restoration, but ultimately, restoration alone likely won’t save coral reefs from warming waters for the foreseeable future,” says Dr. Helen Fox, one of the co-authors on this study and the conservation science director at the Coral Reef Alliance. Fox’s doctoral research focused on coral restoration and she is one of few early researchers to have studied its cost effectiveness and long-term success rate. “For starters, if we don’t also address local threats to reefs, like poor water quality and overfishing, then any corals that are outplanted may also eventually die.” The paper’s authors agree that focusing solely on coral restoration and genetically engineering corals to be more tolerant of high temperatures is risky. Our understanding of the genes that determine heat resistance is limited, and focusing on reproducing just one single trait could undermine a coral’s resilience to other stressors or its natural ability to adapt.  Restoration practices also carry a hefty price tag and require a lot of resources. The median cost of restoring just one hectare (or about 2.5 acres) of coral reef has been estimated at over $350,000, and that’s not factoring in the high mortality rates that often come with such projects and the cost of genetically modifying corals.  “My biggest takeaway from this study is that the scale at which restoration would need to be done is so large that we instead give corals a better chance of surviving climate change with reef management strategies that focus on promoting natural genetic variance,” says Dr. Madhavi Colton, another co-author on the paper and the executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “This means keeping corals healthy by creating and managing marine protected area networks, reducing pollution through better wastewater treatment, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” This study was the result of a collaborative effort between the Coral Reef Alliance, University of Washington, Rutgers University, Stanford University, University of Queensland, University of Hawai’i, and The Nature Conservancy; funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and The Nature Conservancy.

She also previously held the role of executive director for Audubon North Carolina and sat on the National Audubon Society’s Climate Cabinet, acting as a leader for environmental conservation. “The underwater world is what led me to conservation,” says Starck about her decision to join CORAL. In addition to more than 20 years of experience in nonprofit conservation management, Starck brings both a background in marine biology and an incredible enthusiasm for CORAL’s mission to save the world’s coral reefs.“Somewhere in the suspended water and time floating along a reef is where I am most at peace. CORAL’s mission, to save the world’s coral reefs, is one that I can bring my entire personal and professional passion and expertise to support.” Though coral reefs only encompass less than one percent of the earth’s surface, they are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet. They are home to 25 percent of all marine life and support over 500 million people with food, income and coastal protection. They are also one of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet, contributing more than $375 billion in services each year.  But the threats to coral reefs continue to mount, and today nearly 75 percent of all coral reefs are threatened by climate change and localized human activities. Scientists predict that 99 percent of coral reefs will be lost by the end of this century without concerted efforts to protect them.  CORAL works through community partnerships to keep coral reefs healthy throughout Hawaii and the Mesoamerican region, and spearheads global conservation science and collaborations to focus attention on what corals need in order to adapt to future climate conditions.

The recent study, published in the journal  , finds that coral reefs can evolve and adapt to the effects of climate change—but only if we protect a sufficient diversity of coral reefs, particularly when it comes to temperatures.  “Evolution happens when corals that have already adapted to new environmental conditions breed with corals that have not yet adapted,” said Malin Pinsky, associate professor at Rutgers and a coauthor of the study. “As ocean temperatures rise, we need to keep corals in hotter waters healthy and protected so they can reproduce and spread their heat tolerance to other coral reef areas.”  The study advocates for a conservation approach that protects coral reefs at local, regional and global scales, in a way that allows heat tolerance to spread.  The authors of the study said if humanity takes rapid and effective action to keep coral reefs healthy at local scales and addresses climate change, coral reef ecosystems may recover over the next century and thrive in the future.   “The best part about these results are that they underscore the importance of our actions at local scales—we don’t have to just sit back and watch coral reefs suffer as our climate changes,” said Madhavi Colton, lead author of the study and former executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “This study provides guidance on how to design local conservation solutions that will have real, lasting impacts well into the future.”  Coral reefs cover less than one percent of the earth’s surface, but they are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet. Home to about 25 percent of all marine life, coral reefs support an estimated one billion people with food, income and coastal protection. But threats to coral reefs continue to mount. Today, nearly 75 percent of all coral reefs are threatened by climate change and localized human activities.  Scientists predict 99 percent of coral reefs will be lost by the end of this century without concerted efforts to protect them. “We simply cannot afford to lose coral reefs,” said Helen Fox, conservation science director at the Coral Reef Alliance and a collaborating author on the study. “It is imperative that we do what we can to save coral reefs now because we will be faced with combined global economic, humanitarian, and biodiversity crises if we do not.”  The study was co-authored by Malin Pinsky, associate professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources at Rutgers University, as well as Lisa McManus, who conducted the work as a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University and is now faculty at the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology, and researchers from Coral Reef Alliance, University of Washington, Stanford University, University of Queensland, Univeristy of British Columbia and The Nature Conservancy. The research was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and The Nature Conservancy. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is committed to saving the world’s coral reefs. The nonprofit organization works at local, regional, and global levels to keep coral reefs healthy so they can adapt to climate change and survive for generations to come.

        "content": "Coral reefs face a difficult and uncertain future. According to a  , the Earth is currently on track to warm by 2.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, enough to wipe out 99% of reefs. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% in the next seven years to avoid this catastrophe. Meanwhile, local threats like pollution and overfishing, also pose serious challenges. Luckily, there are ways we can protect coral reefs AND address the climate crisis simultaneously. Here are three promising solutions:  A remarkable   come from agriculture and land use. In fact, improving our land management strategies could achieve the same effect as decarbonizing all transportation across the globe, removing   as of 2021.  Of all land-use emissions, half result from deforestation. Forests act as effective carbon sinks, capturing CO  from the air and using it to build new plant tissue through photosynthesis. However, when trees are removed or burnt, often to make way for new agricultural lands, the carbon they store is released back into the atmosphere. Traditional agriculture brings other woes as well, including excessive use of fertilizer and increased rates of erosion. During heavy rain events, nutrients and loose sediment can be carried to waterways and oceans where they have serious negative impacts on coral reefs.   kills reefs by covering them and blocking the sunlight they need to photosynthesize. Nutrients, including those often found in fertilizer runoff, promote the growth of algae that may kill and displace corals entirely.  Fortunately, innovative land-use practices offer a greener and more reef-friendly path forward. The widespread use of   alone, for instance, could reduce the expected amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by up to 23.94 gigatons. As we’ve learned from our work on  , restoring and reforesting abandoned farmlands can also be effective in reducing sediment runoff to nearby reefs and reviving native ecosystems. While protecting ocean habitats and reducing emissions might not seem to go hand-in-hand, marine protected areas (MPAs) can actually have remarkable benefits for the climate as well as wildlife and coastal communities. For coral reefs, well-protected MPAs can prevent exposure to damaging fishing practices, facilitate the rebound of key fish species that keep reefs healthy, provide potential income to communities, increase fish catch, and more.  Lesser known are the benefits that marine protected areas can have for the climate, particularly through protecting seagrass and mangrove ecosystems. Seagrass meadows and mangrove forests are amazingly effective when it comes to sequestering carbon. Seagrasses constitute less than 0.1% of the global marine environment but, through trapping dead roots, leaves, and organic matter, bury 10% of ocean sediment-based carbon in their deep soils. Mangroves contribute disproportionately as well, occupying just 2% of marine environments but sequestering 14% of ocean carbon.  Seagrasses and native mangroves are also critical to coral reef health. Both are found in conjunction with reefs, providing critical nursery habitats for juvenile fish and improving water quality through trapping sediment and other pollutants. On the island of Roatán in the Bay Islands of Honduras, our partners at the Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA) are actively replanting mangroves, restoring the crucial ecosystem services these forests provide.   Arguably the most infamous form of marine pollution, plastics constitute   for coral reefs and marine life.   estimated that 11.1 billion plastic items were entangled across reefs in the Asia-Pacific region alone. That same study also concluded that corals in contact with these plastics experienced an 85% increase in likelihood of disease. Microplastics, microscopic plastic particles produced by the decay of larger pieces of plastic material, can abrade corals, impede their ability to feed, and make infection more likely. Plastics also pose serious issues for the many animals that call coral reefs home. They are also terrible for the climate. Many plastics are made from fossil fuels and petrochemicals. From the extraction and transport of the materials necessary for plastic production, to manufacturing, to incineration, the plastic creation process is fossil-fuel intensive across all stages of production. There is even some preliminary evidence to suggest that plastics in the environment   (both greenhouse gasses) into the atmosphere as they decompose. A transition away from these materials would both dramatically curtail emissions over time and begin to address the severe issues posed to coral reefs by marine debris. To this end, CORAL is   tourists and the tourism industry on the dangers of plastic pollution and other coral reef threats.  From urban planning, to carpooling, to forest protection, there are a wide range of creative solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. You can help make a low carbon, reef-friendly future a reality by doing the following: "

        "content": "Coral reefs are important because they can prevent many things from happening and they can do many things. One thing is that they give animals a home. One of every four marine animals lives in coral reefs. Clownfish, giant clams, turtles, and many different kinds of fish call coral reefs home. Corals help the animals hide from predators and get food. A fun fact about clownfish in coral is that clownfish are really colorful so that they can blend in with the coral. In addition to helping the animals, corals help protect islands from big waves that are coming to destroy, attack, and erode the island.  But coral reefs are bleaching because of human activity, warming oceans, and greenhouse gasses. One of the causes is pollution, such as fertilizers, pesticides, human sewage, oil spills, and oil drills. Greenhouse gasses, like carbon dioxide, are another cause. When carbon dioxide mixes with saltwater it creates acid. Acid helps the corals bleach, which is not helpful. Greenhouse gasses also cause global warming. Global warming causes glaciers and icebergs to melt into the ocean and then the ocean rises. Corals can’t grow because they don’t get enough sunlight. Coral reefs are also bleaching because of global warming and the ocean is getting too hot. Rising temperatures of the water slow down the growing of the coral. Another way the coral is bleaching is because the algae leaves the coral when the water gets too hot and this can kill the coral.  We need to start protecting our coral reefs because it’s now or never. If the coral bleaches, then the reef goes. If the reef goes, then the animals go. If the animals go, then the ocean goes. If the ocean goes, then the planet isn’t a planet. It creates this whole chain.  If you do these things, we can help save the coral reefs. If you are like me, a person who is very sad about coral reefs bleaching, don’t be sad. We can always fix it. We can always make speeches and signs and go protest. We can also   that do research on coral reefs like the Coral Reef Alliance. If we do all of this, then our planet isn’t destroyed and we can save our Planet Earth, our home where we live. "

        "content": "Each year,   It’s a great cause and an important step—but this year, let’s take it even further and consider moving away from single-use plastic altogether. When plastic makes its way to the ocean, it also finds a home in coral reefs, causing serious problems for these elaborate structures of the sea. The world’s coral reefs are home to some of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, supporting over 4,000 types of fish, and over a million aquatic species depend on reefs at some point in their lives. The good news is   Remember, everything leads to the ocean, so being mindful of how often you purchase, use, and discard plastic is key. What we consume on land, no matter how well it’s discarded can easily find its way to waterways where it can harm fish, birds, coral reefs and so much more.   You can use your voice to advocate for change, make a personal decision to decrease plastic usage, and educate others on the amount of waste that harms our coral reefs and the planet at large. How gut-wrenching are these photos?   Plastic entangles wildlife, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers over seven million square miles and is clouded with micro-plastics, and beaches are constantly littered with trash no matter how many cleanups are carried out. But what we see here is barely scratching the surface of the damage being done to our oceans. Plastic makes up about  , and millions of tons of it wind up in our oceans each year.  gave us a better understanding of the impact of all that plastic on reefs in particular. Researchers studied 159 coral reefs in Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Myanmar, and discovered that   Floating bits of plastic block out sunlight, spread pathogens, and cut into corals, making them more susceptible to infection.  This is likely thanks to more vigorous waste management systems compared to other surveyed regions as well as the reefs being much further off shore.  From warming temperatures and rising sea levels to extreme weather and ocean acidification, every resident of the ocean is adapting to these changes to their environment or perishing in its wake.  The scary part? These effects will worsen year over year without some serious climate action, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable. This is especially concerning as a quarter of all marine life depends on their survival. In 2016, over half of all coral reefs faced extreme heat stress, and   was killed. From 2014 to 2017, 75% of the world’s coral reefs faced bleaching-level heat. Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed, most often when ocean water gets too warm. Corals will “eject” the symbiotic algae (called zooxanthellae) that live inside them. When corals lose their algae, they not only lose their color (turning white) but also their built-in food source. Research shows that   if they are healthy. That requires us   (i.e. keeping waste out of the ocean) and it requires us to slow the rate of our emissions. As we use and purchase more plastic, we continue to contribute to this cycle of fossil fuels and climate change. Consider a single-use plastic water bottle: when something like a plastic bottle is used once and then tossed, not only does it clog our oceans and become a threat to sea life, but its short lifespan also means producers are pumping more carbon into the atmosphere to meet those single-use needs.   You can start by incorporating small changes into your life. After all, each step toward more sustainable habits is a step toward a healthier planet. But that’s not the whole story. To take it a step further, we all need to advocate for change at a higher level. Let’s first talk about  .  ! Shop at grocery stores with bulk bins, and bring your own reusable bags and containers to fill. Avoid purchasing items that are wrapped in unnecessary plastic packaging. Bring your own to-go containers to restaurants. Try to repair something that’s broken rather than replacing it. Beyond the grocery aisle,  . Push for policies that limit waste, ban single-use plastics, and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Use your voice as a voter to sign petitions. Let your government representatives know you care by writing letters and making phone calls.   to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and reduce the impact of their production and packaging. And finally,  . Help change the culture of consumerism by using your voice and sharing your story on social media and in social circles. Use hashtags like #breakfreefromplastic and share stories about why you’re working so hard to protect our planet. The more we talk about environmental issues, the more we normalize them. And these ideas are certainly worth normalizing."

This is what artist   sees as she masterfully paints a euphoric underwater world of untouched corals in her latest series “ ,” on display at   in Hudson, NY.  We have proudly partnered with Caldwell Gallery Hudson, as they support Kovalenko’s creative message about coral reef conservation by graciously donating 20 percent of exhibition sales to CORAL.  Kovalenko is a born artist—inspired at a young age by her parents who are also artists in Moscow, Russia. Instead of toys, she played with pastel chalk and cut-out characters her mother drew. At the age of ten, she began her professional art education and later went on to study and work internationally.  After spending time abroad, she was inspired to move away from traditional painting. She now calls herself an environmental artist, covering anything from logged trees in the Amazon Rainforest to the burning of ivory tusks in Africa. In 2019, she went backpacking through South America, where she obtained her diving certification and began exploring the underwater world. Out of all the ocean creatures, she was most drawn to corals—saying “they are the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”  In “Utopian Reefscapes,” Kovalenko paints idealized coral reefs, while utilizing both her imagination and different elements of her underwater photographs. Her mission is to create scenery of abundant, untouched reefs in order to inspire viewers to take better care of the ocean. “Coral reefs are being destroyed because of global warming and other  ,” said Kovalenko. “I want to show all the beauty worth saving.”  Kovalenko also played a role in inspiring gallery owner Jay Caldwell to create something special at Caldwell Gallery Hudson. After forming a friendship several years back, the two exchanged ideas about a novel approach to art-driven philanthropy. Now twice a year, Caldwell Gallery Hudson sponsors exhibitions that empower artists whose work pertains to social or environmental issues. For these exhibitions, Caldwell shifts from the industry standard 50/50 artist-gallery split and offers the artist 60 percent of the commission. He then donates half of the gallery’s 40 percent to a nonprofit organization in the artist’s chosen field. Additionally, Caldwell Gallery Hudson hosts the artist’s residency, resulting in a new piece of art that is raffled off. One hundred percent of the money earned from the raffle tickets also goes to the nonprofit. “It’s an opportunity to dig in a little deeper and help in a direct, tangible way,” says Caldwell. Throughout Kovalenko’s exhibition, Caldwell expanded his knowledge and interest in coral reef conservation and has enjoyed passing this inspiration on to gallery visitors.  Like Caldwell and Kovalenko, we are excited to express our shared passion for protecting coral reefs with the art community. Historically, art has been a very powerful tool and can impact how people see or understand a situation. “Visual messages can really bring it home for many people,” says Kovalenko.  Through this new partnership, we aim to make reefs as healthy as they appear in Kovalenko’s paintings. After all, coral reefs provide a home to more than a million species and contribute food and income to coastal communities. They are an ecosystem worth fighting for—because as Kovalenko says, “Coral reefs are the lungs of our planet.”"

It started back in 2010, when founders and college friends Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman met two Costa Rican artisans who were struggling to make ends meet. To help, they purchased and resold 400 handcrafted bracelets, later turning the sale into a mission-driven business. The company now supports local artisans around the world, while also making conscious efforts to protect the environment.   They were particularly drawn to CORAL’s mission to save coral reefs—an ecosystem that supports more than a million marine species and countless coastal communities with food and income. Pura Vida recognizes the vital importance of protecting the ocean and emulates the essence of beach culture in their products. “[Our customers] care deeply and passionately about protecting the things that they love,” says Vanessa Skaggs, Marketing Manager for Pura Vida. And by working with CORAL, Pura Vida’s community is able to see the direct impact their purchases have on coral reefs, coastal communities, and marine life. To support our mission, Pura Vida created a special   pack, with five percent of sales going directly to CORAL.

We are proud to partner with Kipuka Olowalu and support their vision to revitalize the valley, preserve its native culture, and save the nearby coral reefs.  The Olowalu Cultural Reserve was reorganized as Kipuka Olowalu in 2020 with a broad mission to cultivate environmental and cultural connectivity and perpetuate traditional Hawaiian values. The group focuses on preserving a 75 acre reserve by minimizing invasive species and restoring the land with native plants.  Even though the work is done on land, it expands as far as the ocean. According to Karin Osuga, Kipuka Olowalu’s executive director, the stream that runs through the reserve flows from the base of the mountains to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean. Its water empties directly onto Olowalu’s coral reefs, which act as an important source of larvae for other reefs throughout Maui Nui.  “In Hawai‘i, there is an understanding that whatever we do on land will impact what is going on in the ocean,” says Osuga. “We want to be responsible in both our land and ocean stewardship so everything is in balance.” Our partnership with Kipuka Olowalu started about a year ago, and ever since we have been working together to expand the organization’s capacity and implement a mauka to makai (ridge-to-reef) approach to save coral reefs in Olowalu.

As part of our partnership, CORAL team members will advise the group on actions that will preserve the area’s coral reefs.  Since working with Kipuka Olowalu, Osuga has noticed new life come back to the valley. “Native plants popped up, the bees came back, and dragonflies showed up,” she says. “This quiet space that hadn’t been actively cared for in a while was suddenly buzzing with life.” By preserving the environment in its original state, we can also preserve the knowledge and stories about land and ocean that Hawaiian ancestors have passed down for generations. “In the Hawaiian worldview, there are so many reasons why coral reefs matter. It’s food, it’s culture, it’s recreation, it’s medicine—all of these things are important,” says Osuga. “We should take care of coral reefs because it’s the right thing to do.”"

        "content": "Born in the Philippines and long-time resident of Hawai‘i, Manuel Mejia, our Hawai‘i Regional Program Director, harvests a deep passion for coral reefs and our need to protect them. We recently had the opportunity to sit down with him and dive in to this passion a little more.   A: I’ve loved the ocean since my childhood. I grew up in the Philippines, a beautiful archipelago, and the island communities there depend a lot on marine resources and the ocean. Growing up, my family would go to the ocean for peace and relaxation and that has stayed with me throughout my life. As a teenager, I learned to sail in the Chesapeake Bay. And as an adult, I was fortunate enough to sail on Hokule‘a as crew and science specialist for the Polynesian Voyaging Society’s Worldwide Voyage. When I’m in the ocean, I feel calm and really connected with life and all its wonders. I just find the ocean to be a source of life and inspiration, and I count myself very lucky to have built a meaningful career based on conservation and getting to work with communities to protect our oceans.   A: My parents taught me how to care for coral reefs and respect people and nature. They introduced me to the wonders of this world. For all their importance and beauty, however, coral reefs are often unseen and undervalued even though they are immensely important to humanity. A lot of our food, medicines and recreation come from the ocean. Working across the Pacific with many communities, from Fiji to the Philippines and Indonesia, and here in Hawai‘i, I’ve really learned how important coral reefs are to people’s wellbeing—not just for physical sustenance, but for cultural and spiritual wellbeing, too.   A: Across the Pacific, there’s this caring for the ocean like it’s family, and I see that especially strong here in Hawai‘i. Bioculturally, coral reefs are foundational in Hawai‘i. There is an  , or Hawaiian proverb, that says  , which means “though the sea be deep and rough, the coral rock remains standing.” It’s often said of people or communities who remain calm and persevere through difficult times. And to me, this resilience describes the communities in Hawai‘i that continue traditions of adaptive management and caring for reefs so that they can continue to rely on and take care of their families. There is this beautiful reciprocity between people and the ocean and that inspires me to help carry out our mission at CORAL.   A: When I was a young boy, my father used to take me diving with him. I’d stay on the boat and watch his bubbles come to the surface and I’d follow him. And as we got to shallower water, I still remember it very vividly, I’d start to see the rainbow colors and the riot of marine life teeming in wondrous abundance. And that magic, that wonder, has stayed with me, and I’ll never forget it. I hope we can save reefs so that my children, and my grandchildren, get to experience that same wonder that I experienced as a young boy.   A: Coral reefs provide habitat and shelter for all kinds of marine life—per square inch, they are one of the highest biodiversity habitats in the world. And they provide humanity with a lot of medicines and food for over ½ billion people around the world. In Hawai‘i, they protect our coastal areas to the tune of $836 million annually. Without coral reefs, our economy would be a lot more vulnerable. In terms of livelihoods, and fishermen feeding the families, or local businesses and tourism operations that rely on coral reef ecosystems—I’ve seen this dependency on coral reef health play out countless of times across many countries. Coral reefs keep many island economies thriving. It’s really in our best interest to keep them healthy. As the Hawaiian proverb goes,  —as the ocean thrives, so do we."

        "category": null,
        "content": "Recently, the CORAL team gathered in the vibrant coastal paradise of Cozumel, Mexico, for an unforgettable staff summit. This event brought together staff members, board members, and key partners from around the globe to collaborate, learn, and set the course for the future of coral reef conservation. Our primary goals were to foster relationships among team members, promote cross-departmental collaboration, and provide opportunities for personal growth and skill enhancement. We dove into open-space conversations, tackled conflict resolution workshops, and enjoyed fun activities like scuba diving and snorkeling. These moments helped us bond, improve communication, and strengthen our commitment to protecting our oceans. The dive excursions were a highlight for many of us, providing a chance to see the rich coral reefs of Cozumel up close. We enjoyed several morning dives (and snorkels), including a memorable dive with our board members. These underwater adventures were nothing short of magical. We encountered a variety of marine life, from baby sharks and giant sea turtles to elegant rays and a dazzling array of colorful fish. Every dive served as a reminder of the vibrant ecosystems we are dedicated to protecting. It was particularly exciting to watch our dive masters talk through CORAL-produced dive guides, reminding visitors to adhere to sustainable diving practices. We dove in a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which added an extra layer of significance to our experience. Having a patrol boat check our passes was a highlight, as we know the importance of regulatory efforts in preserving these fragile environments. It was affirming to witness firsthand how our collaborative efforts with local authorities and partners are making a tangible difference. Diving in the MPA not only allowed us to observe the stunning biodiversity of Cozumel’s reefs but also gave us a unique perspective on the impact of our conservation efforts in the region. Being in the water together and experiencing the beauty and challenges of the reefs reinforced our dedication to our mission and the importance of our work. El momento más bonito para mi en el summit fue cuando me lancé al agua para hacer snorkel! (The most beautiful moment for me at the summit was when I jumped into the water to snorkel!) Spending time with the team and board members underwater was an incredible experience. It allowed us to see firsthand the vital importance of our work and underscored why protecting reefs is essential. My favorite moment was diving with the whole team! Key moments included spotting a seahorse, double flying gurnards, and a huge turtle! Our summit was packed with engaging workshops and activities designed to boost our personal growth and skills. One of the standout sessions was our conflict resolution workshop. Using translation software, we broke down language barriers and connected with colleagues we hadn’t previously worked with. These sessions mixed insightful talks with hands-on role-playing exercises, giving us practical tools for navigating challenges and creating a more harmonious work environment. We also participated in open-space conversations, where we could choose from various CORAL-related topics and break into small group discussions. This format allowed us to share thoughts, questions, and ideas freely, encouraging creative problem-solving and a deeper understanding of each other’s work. The best part of the week was being able to see each other and interact personally, connect as a team, and identify our strategies and ways of collaborating. I think this strengthens us as a team. I loved connecting with coworkers I don’t usually meet with, gaining a better understanding of CORAL’s reach, and making valuable connections with the Western Caribbean team. My favorite thing was getting to know more about the ‘whole person’ of many of our fabulous staff! My favorite was feeling the good vibes and team bonding…and all the smiles! Throughout the week we had the opportunity to learn about   in the Western Caribbean. Tanya and Javier, our local experts, provided an in-depth overview, shedding light on both the challenges and successes faced by the region. They discussed the current state of Cozumel’s reefs, highlighting the main stressors such as climate change, pollution, overfishing, and tourism pressure. Our ongoing efforts in the area include reef restoration, sustainable tourism, and community engagement programs. Tanya and Javier outlined our goals for FY25, emphasizing our commitment to expanding these initiatives.  Collaboration with   and the cruise industry was another key focus. By creating DMOs, we ensure tourism development aligns with sustainable practices, benefiting both the environment and the local economy. Engaging with the cruise industry allows us to advocate for responsible tourism and reduce its environmental footprint. At the end of the session, CORAL staff had the opportunity to sit down with local partners to better understand their work and explore future collaboration. These discussions provided invaluable insights and strengthened our commitment to working hand-in-hand with local communities to protect and restore coral reefs. Learning from the successes and challenges in Cozumel gives us a deeper understanding of coral reef conservation complexities and inspires us to implement similar strategies globally. My favorite part of the Summit was the opportunity to showcase the work being done here in the Western Caribbean, while connecting with the entire team as colleagues and most importantly as humans with a common goal. It was great to connect with someone who works directly with the Marine Protected Areas around Cozumel. Having an open dialogue and hearing firsthand about the challenges and benefits of this system was incredibly valuable. Spending quality time with my remote coworkers is always a treat. Being physically in the same space as these wonderful humans–who share the same level of passion and dedication to the ocean–has deepened relationships in ways we are not able to through a computer screen. The CORAL Staff Summit in Cozumel was a testament to the power of unity and shared purpose. As we return to our respective regions, we carry with us renewed energy and a deeper commitment to protecting coral reefs. Together, we are poised to make even greater strides in conservation, ensuring that these vital ecosystems continue to thrive for generations to come."

The Olowalu Reef along the west coast of Maui, also known as the “Mother Reef,” contains some of Hawai‘i’s oldest corals and acts as an important source of larvae to Maui Nui. It also provides food and shelter to many marine animals and is significant to Native Hawaiian culture and the local economy.  Currently, we risk losing Olowalu’s coral reefs due to local stressors in the area, like land-based pollution. When it rains, sediment runs off of degraded landscapes, enters the ocean, and pollutes the water. These contaminants then block sunlight, increase the risk of coral disease, and ultimately can smother coral reefs.  We need to act now if we want to save Olowalu’s reefs and contribute to the protection of Hawai‘i’s nearshore waters. And thanks to the support from Hawai‘i Community Foundation, we are one step closer. This year, we will collaborate with  Kīpuka Olowalu to increase their capacity to implement new coastal resilience strategies in the valley above Olowalu’s reefs. Additionally, we plan to increase awareness and urgency around community action and focus on systemic and structural problems that have led to poor land management. "

The focus for the year was achieving measurable outcomes to save coral reefs and to drive conservation programs and science to the next level. Here, we’ll explore some of the key highlights from the report. We worked with local communities and governments to enhance protection of marine protected areas and to promote sustainable fishing practices. Through this work we protected over 8,000 square kilometers of coral reef habitat, which is a major win for the health of these vital ecosystems. To complement this, CORAL supported 19  , giving them resources to manage and protect their coral reefs. In addition, we kept over 29 million gallons of sewage out of coastal waters. In 2022 we grew our climate adaptation partnerships and technology alongside an alliance of scientists to safeguard coral reefs so they can adapt to climate change. We collected over 2 million temperature data points in the Western Caribbean to understand how reef geomorphology links to thermal and genetic diversity. This data will one day be used to improve satellite technologies. These technologies have the potential to identify a reef’s ability to adapt to warming ocean temperatures. Visit our   to learn more! “As I reflect on the first six months as the executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance, I am overwhelmed with gratitude, awe, motivation and HOPE. From Honduras to Hawaii, I have been on the ground – and in the water – with my CORAL team members.  Together, we have collaborated to hone our strategic plans for CORAL programs for the upcoming years, met with community partners to maintain face-to-face connections, and shown donors the tangible products of their generosity. I want to thank you – the people that make our conservation efforts possible. You enable our researchers to survey thousands of coral colonies, collecting data on habitat diversity and   probability. You ensure   to keep fishers abiding by regulations of marine protected areas. You removed tons upon tons of run-off sediment and gallons upon gallons of sewage from coastal ecosystems.

        "content": "At just 31 years old, Trudy Hilton, a local from the island of Roatan, Honduras is determined to make a lasting impact in her community. She recently became Roatan’s new vice mayor and is focusing on improving the long-term sustainability of the island and its natural environments.  We’re proud to call Hilton a local partner, having previously collaborated with her on initiatives to improve ocean conditions in Roatan. Like CORAL, Hilton understands the value of coral reefs and is dedicated to preserving the many benefits these ecosystems bring to her community. Success didn’t come easily to Hilton. Having grown up in a family affected by generational poverty, she faced many day-to-day challenges and setbacks. But she was able to beat the odds and graduate high school—a major accomplishment in her family—and later went on to study political science at an American college. She has since worked at an HIV/AIDS clinic and in community development, among other projects.  Thanks to her neighbor, a founder of the  , she was inspired to give back to her community from a young age. “I think people see the love I have for my people and for this island,” says Hilton, “That is what opened the door for me to be considered for the position of vice mayor.”   Now in office, Hilton is working to put rules and regulations in place that will protect the island’s coral reefs. “I spent almost every day of my childhood in the water,” says Hilton. “So am I connected [to the ocean]? Absolutely.” According to Hilton, coral reefs are important to her and to the island because of the protection they provide from tropical storms and the value they add to the local tourism industry.  For the last couple of years, Hilton has worked with CORAL, along with other local partners, to improve water and sanitation on Roatan. Wastewater pollution creates challenging conditions for coral reefs and makes it harder for them to adapt to our planet’s changing climate, along with many negative impacts on human health.  Leaders at CORAL, such as our Mesoamerican Regional Program Director Tanya Amaya and Conservation Program Director Jenny Myton, have educated Hilton on wastewater pollution and how it impacts coral reefs. Together, they are now working to implement solutions to this problem.  During her time in office, Hilton says,“We are going to give huge priority to water and sanitation, and black waters, because they are damaging our reefs and affecting our health and the environment.”     While wastewater pollution is a major problem throughout the island, Hilton wants to focus on solving the problem in Coxen Hole.  In Coxen Hole, CORAL has been working with local residents to operationalize a wastewater treatment plant. The goal is to replicate the  , in which we significantly decreased coral disease and bacterial levels in nearshore waters.  “I believe if we can get Coxen Hole in order, then we can do it in any other community,” says Hilton. According to Hilton, a large population, various types of homes, and more traditional ways of thinking, all make Coxen Hole one of most challenging neighborhoods in which to tackle wastewater pollution.  But Hilton is ready to put in the work. She plans to educate and work hand-in-hand with different members of the community, in order to prioritize sanitation initiatives and the positive outcomes clean water will have on local residents and the island’s coral reefs.  We look forward to continuing this important partnership with Hilton and other key players in Roatan, in order to keep coral reef ecosystems healthy and thriving in the Mesoamerican reef region. "

        "content": "Looking at Earth from space, our planet’s rivers and streams resemble a vast network of veins, pulsing with life and water. These natural waterways, part of intricate systems called watersheds, weave through landscapes, connecting us in unseen ways to the ocean’s vast expanse.  Whether it’s a closed watershed draining into a secluded lake or open lagoons merging with the ocean,  Imagine the Earth’s surface veined with a network of rivers and streams, much like the circulatory system in our bodies. These watersheds are nature’s way of collecting and delivering rainwater and snowmelt to the ocean.  .  Watersheds are the Earth’s lifelines, ensuring that water, essential for all forms of life, circulates through ecosystems, towns, cities, and eventually, the sea. Take the Amazon Basin, our planet’s largest watershed, which discharges an average of 209,000 cubic meters of water per second into the Atlantic Ocean. Or the Mississippi River Basin, which gathers water from 31 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, illustrating how watersheds can shape the geography, climate, and economy of extensive regions.  These massive water systems play a crucial role in our world, influencing weather patterns, supporting biodiversity, and providing water resources for billions of people. So why does this matter to coral reefs? Well, as pristine as some of these waterways may appear, the harsh truth is they’re often carriers of pollutants from our cities, farms, and factories. Everything from plastic bottles to agricultural runoff finds its way into these waters, embarking on a destructive journey to the ocean.  The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling vortex of marine debris double the size of Texas, is a stark illustration of how our consumption and waste management practices on land can lead to environmental catastrophes in the ocean.  break down into microplastics, are ingested by marine life, enter into the food chain, and cause untold harm to ocean ecosystems.  leads to deadly algal blooms, creating vast dead zones where life, including coral reefs, cannot thrive. These examples underscore the interconnectedness of our actions and the health of marine environments.  This “water footprint” encompasses not only the direct use of water in our homes but also the indirect use embedded in the lifecycle of goods and services we consume. For instance, the agricultural runoff from producing the food on our plates can lead to nutrient pollution in nearby rivers, which eventually flows into the ocean, causing harmful algal blooms and dead zones.   By becoming mindful of our water footprint and making eco-friendly choices, we can help ensure cleaner rivers and healthier oceans.  Simple yet effective steps like opting for minimal packaging, supporting sustainable agriculture and choosing more plant-based options, reducing water-intensive goods, and cutting down on plastic use can make a big difference. Additionally, choosing organic lawn care to minimize harmful runoff and getting involved in local clean-up efforts are practical ways to keep pollution out of our waterways.  By advocating for policies and initiatives that focus on water quality and pollution reduction, we collectively contribute to a more sustainable and thriving environment. In the heart of Maui Nui, which includes the Hawaiian islands of Maui, Molokai, and Lanai, CORAL is actively working to combat the issue of watershed pollution affecting our oceans.   By adopting a “ridge to reef” approach, we aim to restore the natural function of an ahupua‘a (watershed) to filter stormwater and absorb nutrients, sediments, and other chemicals, showcasing our commitment to protecting these vital connections. By understanding the intricate connections between our local waterways and the ocean, we can begin to appreciate the profound impact our everyday actions have on the world’s oceans.  . Let’s commit to protecting these vital lifelines, ensuring a healthier planet for future generations. Together, we can safeguard the health of our blue planet, proving that even the smallest actions can lead to meaningful environmental change. The journey from land to sea is far more interconnected than we might realize. Our local waterways, from the smallest streams to the mightiest rivers, serve as vital conduits linking our actions on land to the health and vitality of coral reefs and marine ecosystems. As we navigate through Earth Month and beyond, let’s embrace our shared responsibility to protect these precious lifelines. By understanding and appreciating the profound impact of our everyday choices, we can work together to ensure a healthier planet for generations to come. Together, let’s safeguard the health of our blue planet and continue to make a positive difference, one drop at a time."

        "content": "Why don’t we focus on coral restoration? It’s a question we, at CORAL, have been asked time and time again.  We address overfishing, minimize water pollution, support local communities, and lead cutting-edge research on coral adaptation to climate change…but we don’t generally work on coral restoration projects. Our decision comes down to the fact that coral restoration alone is unlikely to save reefs from our planet’s warming temperatures if we don’t reduce local stressors. According to a   published in   and co-authored by CORAL scientists, popular coral restoration techniques would be unlikely to protect coral reefs from climate change. The research used innovative models to explore the response of coral reefs to restoration projects that propagate corals and outplant them into the wild. Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of outplanting corals that have been genetically adapted to warmer temperatures, sometimes called ‘super corals,’ to reefs experiencing climate change as a way to build resilience to warming. The models found that neither approach was successful at preventing a decline in coral coverage in the next several hundred years due to climate change, and that selectively breeding corals to be more heat tolerant will only lead to benefits if conducted at a very large scale over the course of centuries. Even then, the benefits won’t be realized for 200 years. In the models, restoring areas with corals that haven’t been selected to be more heat tolerant was ineffective at helping corals survive climate change except at the largest supplementation levels explored. Though coral restoration can have some benefits, like educating communities about reef ecosystems or replenishing an area that has been hit by a storm or suffered direct physical damage, more scientists are speaking up about the limitations of conservation approaches that focus solely on restoration.  “Our previous research shows that corals have the best chance of adapting to the effects of climate change, like warming ocean temperatures, if there is high genetic diversity and if habitat is protected from other local stressors.” says Dr. Lisa McManus, the study’s co-author and a CORAL partner. “Repopulating a coral reef with corals that have similar genetic makeups could reduce an area’s natural genetic diversity, and therefore make it harder for all corals to adapt to climate change.”  Restoration alone is unlikely to save coral reefs from warming waters—and moreover, the techniques are expensive and would need to be performed at an unrealistically large scale in order to be effective. Additionally, coral restoration projects can only be successful if local threats to reefs are managed effectively: otherwise, you’re utilizing resources to outplant corals into an area where they will soon be threatened by poor water quality or overfishing.  By doing that, we can create the conditions that corals need to be able to adapt to climate change on their own, so long as emissions are also reduced. That’s why we invest in projects that will keep coral reefs healthy and protect a wide-range of diverse coral reef networks.   For example, in Hawai’i and  in the Western Caribbean region, we  , protect marine habitats, invest in wastewater treatment infrastructure, mobilize communities to save their coral reefs—and more. And on a global scale, we advance innovative technologies, like the  , to help stakeholders better understand how to factor natural evolutionary processes into their conservation efforts.  By reducing major threats, like overfishing and water pollution, we are keeping coral reefs healthy at the local level. We are also advocating for climate action and building worldwide partnerships and spreading awareness of how to create the necessary conditions for corals to adapt to climate change. We know we have a long road ahead. But by focusing on the most effective conservation strategies, we have a fighting chance to save coral reefs—some of the ocean’s most valuable marine ecosystems. "

        "content": "As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, the health of our oceans remains a critical concern. Oceans cover more than 70% of our planet’s surface and are integral to life on Earth. However, the future of these vast, life-sustaining waters are increasingly threatened.  Here’s why clean water is vital for the future of our oceans. Clean water is the cornerstone of healthy marine ecosystems.  From the tiniest plankton to the largest whales, these ecosystems rely on the purity of water to sustain life.  Coral reefs are incredibly sensitive to changes in water quality. Polluted water can lead to disease, coral bleaching, and death, impacting not only the corals but also the myriad of species that depend on them for shelter and food. Did you know? Approximately   rely on seafood as a primary source of protein.   Toxins such as mercury and microplastics accumulate in marine life and can pose significant health risks to humans who consume contaminated seafood. Moreover, many coastal communities depend on clean oceans for their livelihoods. Fishing, tourism, and recreation industries all require healthy marine environments. The degradation of water quality can lead to economic losses and affect the well-being of these communities. Oceans play a pivotal role in regulating the Earth’s climate.  However, polluted and degraded oceans lose their capacity to perform these essential functions. Pollution can also exacerbate ocean acidification, a process where increased CO2 levels lower the pH of seawater. This has severe consequences for marine life, particularly for organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as mollusks and corals. Maintaining clean water in our oceans is essential to support their role in climate regulation and to protect marine biodiversity. Clean water is crucial for the conservation of marine biodiversity.  Polluted oceans can lead to dead zones—areas with such low oxygen levels that marine life cannot survive. These zones are often caused by nutrient pollution from agricultural runoff, which leads to algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water.  Biodiverse ecosystems are better able to withstand and recover from environmental stressors, making the health of our oceans a matter of global environmental stability. Protecting the future of our oceans requires concerted efforts at multiple levels.  Limiting the use of single-use plastics, properly disposing of waste, and reducing chemical runoff from agriculture and industry are critical steps.  Promoting   and aquaculture practices helps ensure that marine populations remain healthy and that ecosystems are not overexploited.  Addressing climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions will help mitigate the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.  Establishing  , implementing wastewater treatment plants, and supporting conservation initiatives can safeguard critical habitats and species.  Increasing awareness about the importance of clean oceans and encouraging responsible behavior among individuals and communities is essential. It’s crystal clear…clean water is vital for the health and sustainability of our oceans and our planet. It supports marine life, human health, and economic stability, and plays a key role in regulating the Earth’s climate. Protecting our oceans from pollution and degradation is a shared responsibility that requires urgent and sustained action. The future of our planet depends on it."

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Can you imagine being constantly forced to drink, swim, and bathe in dirty, polluted water? It’s a harsh reality for many humans, yet ironically, our actions subject coral reefs to the same grim conditions. Water quality threats are a major culprit in coral decline. Among the various contaminants, untreated wastewater or sewage emerges as a leading contributor, causing devastating effects on coral health. And well, let’s face it, that’s…crap.  But before we break down the major water quality issues affecting coral reefs today, let’s touch on why this is important. Coral reefs are indispensable ecosystems, punching well above their size. Occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor, they support an astonishing 25% of all marine species. Their economic value is staggering, generating billions annually through tourism, fisheries, and safeguarding coastal areas.  Beyond their economic impact, reefs are vital in global climate regulation, contributing significantly to carbon and nitrogen cycles. Despite their critical role, coral reefs face an expanding number of threats, jeopardizing their survival. Let’s talk about untreated (or poorly treated) wastewater, or as we like to call it, straight-up sewage. Our team has categorized this as one of the biggest threats to reefs around the world.  The issue comes from both cities and rural areas where the sewage systems are, let’s say, less than ideal. When this untreated sewage flows into coastal waters, it brings along a cocktail of nasty stuff like high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients are a buffet for algae, which grows out of control and smothers coral reefs, blocking sunlight and sucking up oxygen.  On top of that, sewage is a breeding ground for bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that can make corals sick. And let’s not forget the household and industrial chemicals mixed in, which are toxic and mess with coral reproduction and growth. In short, untreated sewage is bad news for our reefs. Agricultural activities are another big culprit in water pollution. Think about it – all those pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used on farms don’t just stay put. They run off into rivers and eventually end up in the ocean.  When these chemicals hit the water, they promote harmful algal blooms (HABs), which produce toxins detrimental to coral health. These substances also cause sedimentation, making the water cloudy and blocking sunlight from reaching the corals. And without sunlight, corals can’t photosynthesize and thrive. Industries along coastlines often dump pollutants straight into the ocean. We’re talking about heavy metals, oil, and other harmful chemicals.  Really? Yes, really. These pollutants can have catastrophic effects on coral reefs. They build up in the tissues of marine organisms, causing long-term health issues. Plus, they mess with the reproductive systems of corals, making it harder for them to bounce back from other stresses. Plastic pollution is a catastrophic, growing problem for our oceans, and coral reefs are especially vulnerable. Plastic debris can physically damage coral structures, breaking branches and harming their growth. Even worse, plastic can act as a vehicle for pathogens, introducing diseases and causing widespread coral decline.   have found that coral reefs with plastic debris were 20 times more likely to be diseased than those without. Humans produce about 300 million tons of plastic  , and an estimated 8 million tons of it end up in the oceans. If we don’t tackle this issue, our reefs will continue to decline. Construction activities, deforestation, and coastal development significantly increase sedimentation rates in coastal waters. This excess sediment clouds the water, preventing essential sunlight from reaching coral reefs, which is critical for their photosynthesis and survival.  Additionally, sediment often carries harmful pollutants such as heavy metals and pesticides, further compromising water quality. As sediment accumulates, it can bury corals, suffocating them and impeding their ability to regenerate. Climate change, though not a water quality issue itself, intensifies numerous challenges for coral reefs. Increasing sea temperatures trigger coral bleaching events, where corals expel their vital algae partners, leading to widespread mortality if prolonged.  Moreover, ocean acidification from rising CO2 levels weakens coral skeletons, making them vulnerable to additional stressors. These compounding effects underscore the urgent need for global action to mitigate climate change and protect coral reef ecosystems. Untreated wastewater is the primary culprit, introducing harmful nutrients, pathogens, and chemicals into the ocean.  Tackling untreated wastewater is critical for the longevity of coral reefs. Improving infrastructure by investing in proper sewage treatment facilities can significantly reduce the amount of untreated wastewater entering marine environments and allow coral reefs to recover and thrive. Enforcing stricter regulations on wastewater discharges can minimize pollution, educating communities about the impacts of untreated wastewater on coral reefs can foster better waste management practices, and implementing green infrastructure, such as constructed wetlands, can naturally treat sewage before it reaches the ocean. Coral reefs are in big trouble if we don’t take action now.  Addressing this challenge requires concerted efforts from governments, industries, and communities. By doing this critical work, we can preserve these lifegiving ecosystems for future generations. For more insights on marine conservation and the latest updates on coral reef health, stay tuned. Protecting our oceans is not just an environmental necessity but a legacy we owe to the planet."

To save coral reefs, we must address two major threats: poor water quality from land-based pollution and unsustainable fishing practices. By tackling these issues and implementing climate-smart planning, we can help coral reefs adapt to climate change. Our research shows that this is not only possible but that solutions are available right now. The future of coral reefs is promising. By now you may have seen our BBC mini-documentary featuring a community working alongside CORAL to secure a vibrant future for their reef. This collaboration ensures the reef can continue to sustain the livelihoods that depend on it, showcasing a model for successful conservation efforts. In the Honduran community of West End, we successfully implemented a community-supported wastewater treatment plant, connecting 36 restaurants, 333 homes, and 63 businesses, including 11 dive shops. It may not be the most glamorous work, but it has the biggest impact on these delicate ecosystems! The West End project alone is keeping 30 million gallons of raw sewage annually off what was once a dying reef and a beach unsafe for families to swim. Now, we are focusing on a wastewater project in Coxen Hole. Our goal beyond this is to replicate our successes in three more communities.   to our Clean Water for Reefs Campaign will help tackle wastewater issues in priority coral reef areas with significant tourism impacts, including Cozumel, Mexico; Coxen Hole, Roatan; and Caye Caulker, Belize. These locations have what we call “enabling conditions”, the conditions that set us up for success:  to our Clean Water for Reefs campaign will connect another 800 homes to the wastewater system, resulting in 49 MILLION gallons of sewage being properly treated before entering the ocean. We have communities willing and ready to implement these solutions and now we need everyone to do their part to make it happen!"

Thanks to our Global Conservation Science team, we have given everyone the opportunity to participate in the recovery of coral reefs during bleaching events. As climate change warms our oceans, we know corals can adapt, but only if we let them. Our team in the Western Caribbean was busy in 2023! We all know access to clean water is essential for life, and coral reefs are no different. Securing clean water for reefs is a foundational effort here at CORAL, and our team created the Marine Water Quality Protocol for the Mesoamerican Reef System.  In addition to clean water, coral reefs thrive from their symbiotic relationships with the creatures around them. In the spirit of sustainable fishing practices, our team has also worked diligently on preserving lobsters and conchs, of which both are equally ecologically important for coral reef ecosystems. In 2023 we officially kicked off our partnership with Ka Honua Momona (KHM) in Molokai. KHM staff have lineal ties to this beautiful place and have kuleana (responsibility) in caring for Alii and Kalokoeli fishponds, which are community treasures and sources of education, food, cultural renewal, and connection. As a result of this project’s efforts to improve habitat for fish and wildlife, we anticipate a simultaneous enhancement of community resilience. Unfortunately, coral reefs are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms. This has led to a decline in the health and resilience of many coral reefs, which in turn has negatively impacted the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them for food, income, and cultural identity. To address these challenges, a team of researchers from University of Leeds (UK), Coral Reef Alliance (USA), Rare (Philippines & Indonesia), Pattimura University (Indonesia), and many other partners are launching a project in the Philippines and Indonesia.

We all know the oceans are facing some tough times, but there’s plenty of room for optimism.   It’s about being mindful and making choices that matter. In this article, we’re going to break down some straightforward and effective ways to help our oceans thrive in 2024. So, let’s get into it and see how we can all contribute to a healthier, happier ocean. Plastic pollution is a major issue for our oceans, but tackling it is easier than you might think. This year, let’s challenge ourselves to cut back on single-use plastics. Think reusable water bottles, cloth bags for shopping, and paper/metal straws.  These small switches in our daily routine can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste we contribute to the ocean. It’s all about making conscious choices that have a positive impact on our marine environment: The increase in carbon dioxide levels is not just a global warming issue; it’s also making our oceans more acidic, affecting coral reefs worldwide. You can help by adopting eco-friendly transportation methods, like cycling or public transit, and being more energy-efficient at home. Even small changes, like reducing water heating or using energy-saving appliances, can add up to a big difference. Here are some small changes you can make: The seafood on our plates directly impacts the health of our oceans. This year, let’s be more conscious about our seafood choices. Opt for sustainably sourced seafood, look for certifications, or use resources like sustainable seafood apps to make informed decisions. Another impactful approach is to reduce overall seafood consumption or switch to plant-based alternatives. By being mindful of our seafood consumption, we’re taking a significant step towards supporting healthy ocean ecosystems. The future of our oceans is deeply influenced by the policies our leaders put in place. This year, let’s take our advocacy for marine conservation up a notch. Stay informed about environmental issues, and when it’s time to vote, choose candidates who prioritize the health of our oceans. But remember, our responsibility doesn’t end at the voting booth.

        "content": "In the wake of the devastating wildfires that swept through Maui, the Coral Reef Alliance felt a deep sense of urgency to act. The wildfires in Lahaina, a place many call home, not only ravaged the landscape but also struck at the heart of our ‘ohana—our family, friends, supporters, and the vibrant ecosystems we are committed to protecting. This tragedy served as a stark wake-up call, underscoring the critical nature of our mission to safeguard our oceans and the communities that rely on them. In response, we launched the  , an emergency fund reserved specifically for climate change-related disasters, including coastal flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and mass bleaching events. This initiative wasn’t merely a reaction to a crisis; it emerged from the necessity to bolster the resilience and health of our coastal ecosystems and communities, ensuring their sustainability for generations to come. “The people are most important right now to everyone,”   Heather Starck, Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, in the early days following the disaster. “We have staff, family, friends, and colleagues facing unimaginable loss. Our focus is on supporting them as we all work towards recovery.” This sentiment has continuously fueled our commitment to Maui’s recovery and resilience. The wildfires that swept through Lahaina have underscored the vulnerability of our communities and the ecosystems that sustain them.   The aftermath of the fires saw three such organizations facing unprecedented challenges, with losses that threatened to halt their crucial work. Through the Community Resilience Fund, we’ve been able to offer unrestricted support to: By extending a helping hand to these organizations, we not only aid in their immediate recovery but also reinforce the foundation of our collective mission. Each of these groups embodies the essence of resilience and dedication to the environment and community of West Maui. Their work is integral to the health of both land and sea, which in turn benefits the coral reef ecosystems we are working to protect. As for the reefs, the true extent of the wildfires’ impact remains uncertain. “We do not know the state of the reefs yet, but we’re working with our partners to find out,” says Makayla Rickard, Maui Nui Program Manager. The fires have likely left behind toxic chemicals that could be flushed into the ocean, posing significant risks to the reefs, especially those near Lahaina, like the ancient Olowalu Reef. The main threats to these vital ecosystems are runoff and debris, which could bury the reefs, blocking sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. There’s also the risk of algae blooms, fueled by fertilizers or sewage in the runoff, which can smother corals. “In the wake of the recent wildfires, the health of our coral reefs and the quality of the surrounding waters remain top priorities for us.

        "content": "Hang tight, because we’re about to clear up one of the ocean’s biggest misconceptions.  Have you ever looked at a coral reef and thought, “Wow, what a beautiful plant… or is it a rock?” You’re not alone in the confusion. But here’s the scoop: corals are actually animals, and they’re as lively and complex as the ocean itself. We’re diving into the world of corals to debunk some common misconceptions and reveal the truth about these vibrant underwater communities. The appearance of corals can lead to two common misconceptions – that they’re either plants or just inanimate rocks. Let’s explore why neither is true by taking a closer look at both soft and hard corals. Soft corals, including sea fans, sea pens, and blue corals, belong to the Octocorallia group and challenge the plant misconception with their graceful, swaying movements. Unlike plants,   don’t photosynthesize but have a symbiotic relationship with algae that do. Supported by spiny structures called sclerites rather than a hard skeleton, soft corals exhibit the flexibility and dynamism characteristic of animal life, contributing significantly to the reef’s ecosystem by offering shelter and a vibrant backdrop for marine life. Hard corals, or stony corals, form the rigid, complex structures often mistaken for rocks. These corals are colonies of tiny polyps that secrete calcium carbonate, forming a hard skeleton that is the foundation of coral reef ecosystems.   ability to build and shape the underwater landscape showcases their role as living, dynamic animals. They capture food, engage in symbiotic relationships, and respond to environmental changes, far from the static existence of a rock. A common myth is that corals grow in the same manner as plants. While corals do grow and spread over time, their method of growth is distinctly animal.   by cloning themselves, a process where a single polyp divides into two or more new polyps, expanding the colony. This asexual reproduction, known as budding, is a trait shared with other animals, not plants. Moreover, corals can also  , releasing eggs and sperm into the water to create new coral larvae. This dual strategy for growth and reproduction underscores their animal nature, differing significantly from plant growth and reproduction mechanisms. The presence of zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae living within most corals, leads to the misconception that corals themselves perform photosynthesis. While these algae do photosynthesize within the coral’s tissues, providing essential nutrients, the coral itself is not capable of photosynthesis. This relationship is a form of mutualism where both the coral (animal) and the algae (plant) benefit, further emphasizing the coral’s role as an animal that depends on its relationship with plant-like organisms for survival, rather than being a plant itself. Another myth is that, unlike animals, corals do not respond to their environment. In reality, corals have a sophisticated relationship with their surroundings. They can sense changes in light, temperature, and water chemistry, adjusting their behavior accordingly. For example, corals can expel their symbiotic algae when water temperatures become too high, a stress response known as  . While this is a defensive mechanism, it highlights corals’ sensitivity and responsiveness to environmental changes, traits characteristic of animals. These vibrant ecosystems, crafted by small yet resilient animals, highlight the ocean’s incredible resilience and diversity. Recognizing corals as living entities prompts us to reevaluate our relationship with the marine environment. This understanding serves as a call to action, urging us to adopt more responsible behaviors and make choices that support the health of our oceans. By acknowledging our role in this ecosystem, we’re invited to contribute positively to the preservation of coral reefs and the rich biodiversity they sustain."

        "content": "Let’s explore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), the safe places of our ocean’s biodiversity. In the world of conservation, MPAs are a key strategy for safeguarding the most lively and endangered parts of our oceans. These are special areas–managed by a variety of stakeholders, including governments, local communities, and organizations like ours–that vary from places with strict regulations around sustainability to spots where human access is completely restricted. These areas are crucial for protecting marine life and their homes, while also allowing for responsible human interaction with these vital ecosystems. , shielding them from threats like overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. By offering safe breeding grounds, MPAs do more than just conserve biodiversity; they also help replenish fish stocks, supporting both the natural environment and the economies of coastal communities. This dual benefit is a testament to the essential role MPAs play in maintaining ocean health. Moreover,  , offering insights into marine ecology and helping to refine conservation efforts to bolster the resilience of marine ecosystems around the globe. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) play a pivotal role in the health and sustainability of our oceans. Among the diverse types of MPAs,  . In these areas, all forms of extractive activities, including fishing, drilling, and mining, are prohibited. This absolute protection is designed to allow marine ecosystems to recover and flourish, undisturbed by human interference, making them vital sanctuaries for endangered species and biodiversity hotspots. On the other hand,  . These areas are designed to harmonize environmental protection with human needs, allowing for sustainable fishing, responsible tourism, and even some level of resource extraction. The goal is to ensure these activities do not compromise the ecological integrity of the marine environment. By implementing a carefully managed plan, multiple-use MPAs can support local economies, providing livelihoods for communities while still prioritizing the conservation of marine life and habitats. Dr. Helen Fox, our Conservation Science Director, has helped shed new light on how effective these MPAs can be. She has   showing that  . Even in places where human activity is high, multiple-use MPAs can work just as well as no-take zones in helping marine life flourish and supporting the people who live nearby. This finding is crucial because it shows we need all types of MPAs to keep our oceans healthy and resilient. Thanks to Dr. Fox’s insights, we’re learning that the right balance of protection and sustainable use in MPAs can make a big difference for both our marine environments and local communities. It’s about finding ways to protect our oceans while also considering the needs of those who depend on them. The success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is deeply intertwined with the active participation of local communities. By marrying traditional knowledge with the latest in conservation science, MPAs foster a profound sense of responsibility and care among those who live by the sea.  From the vibrant ecosystems of the Galápagos Marine Reserve to the historical sites within the USS Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, MPAs protect a wide range of unique habitats and species. Despite covering just a fraction of the ocean’s vast expanse, these areas are critical to global marine conservation efforts, contributing significantly to the overall health of our oceans. In Honduras, for example, we’ve seen remarkable progress with over   now under effective management and protection, partly thanks to the introduction of locally supported patrolling programs. This effort has been vital in protecting these areas from illegal activities and ensuring a thriving habitat for marine life. Our journey in marine conservation is evolving, with a keen focus on practical steps to protect our oceans. A prime example of this is our initiative to establish a new ‘no-take zone’ in Roatan, Honduras. This area, stretching from Sandy Bay to West Bay, is a critical reef ecosystem, highlighted by the discovery of vital fish spawning sites. To make this vision a reality, we’re teaming up with local communities, dive shops, and government bodies. Our approach is all about working together—educating, planning, and enforcing conservation strategies that everyone can stand behind. Together, we create a united front against overfishing and poaching, ensuring our marine life thrives. This effort in Roatan is just the beginning. We believe in the power of community-driven conservation to spark widespread change, safeguarding our oceans for the future. Join us as we continue to protect these vital ecosystems, one step at a time."

The new legislation officially bans the commercial fishing of sharks in all 1,990,530 square kilometers of the nation’s waters, an area equivalent to the size of Mexico. The Marshall Islands joins Palau, Honduras, Tokelau, the Maldives, and the Bahamas in prohibiting the commercial fishing of sharks in their nation’s waters. “We salute the Republic of the Marshall Islands for recognizing the importance of healthy shark populations to our oceans,” said Matt Rand, director of global shark conservation for the Pew Environment Group, the organization which is spearheading efforts to establish shark sanctuaries where targeted fishing for the species is prohibited. “The momentum for protecting these animals continues to spread across the globe, creating greater areas where they can thrive without the threats of commercial fishing.” The news of the Marshall Islands comes as Fiji’s government considers revisions to its own fisheries laws that would ban commercial shark fishing and the trade of shark fins and other products derived from sharks captured in national waters. \nThe Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), in partnership with the Pew Environment Group and the Fijian Ministry of Fisheries, is championing this new legislation. Through a targeted campaign determined to raise local support for a designated shark sanctuary, the team is educating communities in Fiji about the importance of sharks to both their history and their economy. “Fiji is home to a high diversity of sharks and many of these species are threatened with extinction globally,” said Manoa Rasigatale, a member of CORAL’s Fiji shark sanctuary campaign team. “It is time for the Fijian people to proudly stand alongside our brothers in the Central Pacific to ensure long-lasting protection for sharks.” The Fijian government is expected to issue an official decree before the year’s end.

        "content": "October 20, 2011 Suva, Fiji (Oct. 20, 2011)-Fiji’s reputation as a leader in marine conservation may be enhanced if a proposal made by the Ministry of Primary Industries’ Department of Fisheries and Forests advances next month. The agency is considering measures that would ban the commercial fishing and trade of sharks and their parts, including fins. The proposal is being drafted, and if it advances in the Cabinet, new legislation could be in place before year’s end. The government has the support of traditional leaders, as well as the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and the Pew Environment Group, nonprofit organizations that this week will launch a campaign to raise community awareness about the importance of sharks in Fiji. “A national shark sanctuary in Fiji would be a huge victory for these animals,” said Matt Rand, director of global shark conservation for the Pew Environment Group. “This action would close down a major hub in the Pacific for the trafficking of fins and highlight Fiji as home to the world’s second-largest shark sanctuary.” The proposed Fiji National Shark Sanctuary, encompassing the country’s 1.3-million-square-kilometer Exclusive Economic Zone, would be the first of its kind in Melanesia. It is modeled after similar conservation measures in the Marshall Islands, Palau, the Maldives, Honduras, the Bahamas, and Tokelau. According to Fisheries Department annual reports, the country’s exports in 2003 were 180 metric tons of shark products. Most of Fiji’s shark fins are exported. “We don’t eat shark,” said Ratu Lalabalavu, who has expressed support for a national shark sanctuary in his capacity as the traditional leader of the Tovata Confederacy. “We feel that we are doing justice to something that is very much part of our life and our history in protecting sharks.” The heads of the Burebasaga Confederacy and Kubuna Confederacy also support the designation of Fijian waters for shark conservation. “The Fijian people have a long history of supporting locally-managed marine areas,” said Rick MacPherson, conservation programs director at CORAL. “This strong cultural connection to the reefs makes our job easier as we work alongside the Fijian community to develop an effective sanctuary for sharks that benefits both the marine ecosystem and the people who rely on it. This shark movement is an excellent opportunity for us to use our resources to unite a nation to protect marine ecosystems.” Sharks are significant to the health of coral reefs. “A reef without sharks is a sick reef,” said Demian Chapman, PhD, a shark scientist at Stony Brook University in New York, who in March provided an assessment of the shark fin trade for fisheries officials in Fiji’s capital, Suva. As top ocean predators, sharks regulate the populations of prey species and potentially the overall health of the ocean, according to Chapman. Falling populations of these animals might even lead to general coral reef decline. “There is a clear empirical association between thriving shark populations and healthy coral reef ecosystems,” he said. Chapman found that the shark fin trade in Suva includes the sale of thousands of fins from sharks that are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, such as scalloped hammerhead (Endangered) and silky, blacktip reef, and bull sharks (all Near Threatened). His assessment also found trade in fins from shark species that live and breed on the reef, and are important for ecotourism. Earlier this year, the Australian Institute for Marine Studies found that reef sharks in Palau contribute nearly US$18 million annually to the national economy through diving and associated tourism activities. A similar analysis in French Polynesia found that an individual lemon shark has a lifetime value of more than US$300,000, a significantly higher figure than if it had been caught for its fins. “A living shark is worth far more than a dead shark,” said Rand. The launch event Monday, Oct. 24, at Suva’s Village 6 theater, includes the screening of a 30-minute documentary called “Shark Hope,” which is about the plight of Fiji’s sharks and efforts to protect them. It chronicles the importance of these animals to Fiji’s culture through myths and stories, as well as the critical role they play in maintaining a healthy marine environment. The film features Ratu Lalabalavu, whose traditional title is Gone Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau, and Ratu Manoa Rasagitale, who is a Fijian cultural icon, former senator, and reality television personality. # # # The Pew Environment Group is the conservation arm of The Pew \nCharitable Trusts, a nongovernmental organization that works globally to \nestablish pragmatic, science-based policies that protect our \noceans, preserve our wildlands, and promote clean energy.

The reef is so exceptional that the local municipal government recently declared it a marine protected area, and CORAL is now launching an effort with local officials, conservation groups, and business owners to ensure its future protection. Divers who have the opportunity to visit this area will get an extraordinary glimpse of what a Caribbean reef looked like nearly thirty years ago. The healthy reef includes an area known as Capiro Banks, which boasts an astounding 69 percent live coral cover. With the average coral cover in the Caribbean today at less than 20 percent, the reef is a rare find. Furthermore, the reef boasts an unusually high concentration of Diadema sea urchins—important reef grazers whose populations plummeted in the 1980s. And just northwest of Capiro Banks, adjacent to a terrestrial park, the team recorded more than 800 critically endangered elkhorn corals. This important reef-building coral provides valuable habitat for marine life. “These reefs along the Caribbean mainland of Honduras are quite remarkable,” noted Jason Vasques, Assistant Director of Conservation Programs at CORAL. “The discovery of Capiro Banks is surprising because here is a remarkable reef that has no business being where it is. Despite increasing pressure from nearby nutrient-rich and sediment laden rivers and watersheds, this coral oasis appears to be thriving. While many elkhorn coral populations have collapsed throughout the Caribbean due to disease outbreaks, bleaching, and numerous other localized impacts, this particular reef is defying the odds. It may also be a critical source of coral spawn that could potentially allow this endangered species to repopulate the region.” The declaration of the marine protected area near Tela was based in part on reef monitoring data collected by CORAL and HRI as part of the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) program. After the team presented its findings to the Honduras Vice-Minister of Tourism Synthia Bennett Soleman and David Zacaro, the Mayor of Tela, Zacaro wasted no time in making the declaration. “We are very excited about this newly protected area,” he shared, “but we also understand the great responsibility that has been put upon our shoulders. We must work tirelessly together in order to ensure the future of this beautiful gift, so that future generations can also enjoy the benefits of our amazing reefs.” The protection of the reef area near Tela follows a significant decision made by the Honduran government earlier this year to designate Cordelia Banks a Site of Wildlife Importance. Located not far from Tela, off the southwest coast of Roatan, Honduras, Cordelia is home to one of the Caribbean’s largest known stands of staghorn coral—an IUCN-listed critically endangered species. Honduras, with the elkhorn coral at Tela and the staghorn coral in Cordelia, can now claim protections for significant populations of two endangered corals. Reports of Tela’s reefs are spreading quickly throughout the local tourism industry. Construction has just broke ground on the new Tela Marine Research Center. This facility is expected to serve as an educational resource for the greater public about coral reef conservation and will accommodate the needs of approximately 30 to 40 divers each day. Marcello Dicunta, a PADI dive instructor and owner of the Tela Dive Center, is looking forward to the possibilities arising from this discovery. “Seasoned divers will find Tela’s reef different from anything they have seen before. And because it’s so different, we need to ask important questions like why are the coral coverage and sea urchin populations thriving here. Compared to the rest of the Caribbean, Capiro Banks is a very healthy reef and it’s worth preserving so that we can spend time studying it.” Antal Borcsok, member of the Tela Chamber of Tourism’s Board of Directors, also sees tremendous potential for the area. “This incredible news has sent shock waves throughout the entrepreneurial veins of the people of Tela. We recognize how important it is to act quickly and responsibly to ensure a long-term, sustainable source of income for the community.” CORAL and its partners are already preparing for the potential impact that added dive tourism will have on the reefs near Tela. Recent programs include installing moorings to reduce anchor damage to sensitive reef habitats, training local marine operators and community teachers in sustainable marine recreation principles, and working with federal authorities to eventually designate Tela’s reefs a Site of Wildlife Importance. “It is critical that political and private interests align to protect these amazing reefs,” said Vasques. “We look forward to being involved in this locally-driven movement and are committed to helping the community of Tela protect its reefs.”"

        "content": "We recently held our annual State of the Reef Address, which highlighted the urgent need for action to protect coral reefs. Heather Starck, the Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, emphasized the devastating impact of climate change, overfishing, pollution, and other human activities on coral reefs around the world. Coral reefs are critical ecosystems that provide food and livelihoods for millions of people; their preservation is vital. Heather stressed that coral reefs are still in decline. This means that nearly 1 trillion dollars annually in food, tourism, and coastal protection are in jeopardy. Our science is telling us that 75% of reefs are currently threatened and this figure is anticipated to climb to 90% by 2030. “We’re also seeing that  in the Western Caribbean is spreading at 155 meters per day” according to Heather and the CORAL team scientists. This is a highly lethal disease that started in 2014 and continues to spread rapidly across the Caribbean. While there’s urgency to act, the team at CORAL has reason for hope. Starck shared with us that, “for example, 341 commitments worth nearly $20 billion were recently made at the   this month in Panama including funding for expanding and improving marine protected areas and biodiversity corridors.” We find hope in the fact that 193 countries within the UN agreed to the first of its kind high seas treaty to protect 30 percent of our lands and Oceans by 2030. Starck described CORAL’s science-based approach for addressing the needs of the world’s coral reefs. This includes supporting resilient coastal communities, reducing water pollution, and promoting sustainable fisheries – all of which we believe will allow coral reefs to adapt and survive as they face global climate change. Next  , CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, shared exciting updates on the progress made by her team in advancing the science around coral adaptation and evolution. This is in hopes that reefs to adapt to the environmental changes brought on by climate change. Dr. Fox’s team has been working with the  , a new resource that maps the world’s coral reefs and monitors their threats to provide actionable data and a shared understanding of coral ecosystems. CORAL is part of the Atlas partnership and is leading the coordination of the field component of coral bleaching monitoring program. One day, we hope to  that helps to improve the detection of bleaching events from space. The most engaging addition to the State of the Reef Address this year was live video streaming to field sites in both the Western Caribbean and Hawaii. , CORAL’s Conservation Program Director, and Francis Lam, Executive Director of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras, spoke about their work in the region. One of the main programs at the Roatan Marine Park is the patrol program, which has five boats of rangers who survey this protected marine zone and deter illegal fishing and other activities that counteract local community efforts to improve the environment. CORAL’s holistic approach to supporting local organizations has made a real difference in coral reef health in the Western Caribbean, as evidenced by the growth and impact of the Roatan Marine Park. Next we went to the Mauka (mountains) of Maui where our Hawaiian Islands Program Coordinator,  , and team are working on sedimentation, a critical issue in the Waikoli watershed of West Maui. They are decommissioning agricultural roads that run parallel to stream gulches and installing plants to trap the sediment.  Our approach is intended to be a long-term, nature-based solution to the problem of stormwater run-off depositing tons of sediment suffocating the corals. The Coral Reef Alliance plans to scale up its work to meet the growing needs of coral reefs, and the organization depends on the support of its community to succeed. The  , Kirby Ryan, expressed gratitude to everyone for their ongoing support and involvement in the Alliance’s work despite the challenges of the pandemic. Looking forward, we plan to continue urgent and important work to protect and restore coral reefs globally, with the hope of gaining more support from people who are interested in preserving this critical natural wonder that supports 25% of ocean life and hundreds of millions of people. CORAL’s 2023 State of the Reef Address has emphasized the pressing need for action to protect coral reefs. Through the work of scientists, conservationists, and local communities, we hope to preserve these critical ecosystems for future generations.

        "content": "In recent years, there’s been a growing demand for companies to assume responsibility for their environmental impact, driven by consumers who prioritize sustainable products. Failure to address these concerns puts companies at risk of losing market share to competitors who embrace sustainability. Say hello to Fresh Clean Threads, a clothing brand that understands the significance of sustainability and actively incorporates environmentally responsible practices into its business model. Dedicated to providing comfortable and affordable basics, Fresh Clean Threads has embarked on a journey towards becoming fully green within the next five years. To achieve this goal, they’re is implementing various measures. They’re reducing water usage in fabric dyeing, incorporating recycled polyester into their clothing production, eliminating single-use plastics, and adopting eco-friendly practices in their factories. These initiatives reflect their commitment to minimizing the negative impact on the world’s oceans, which face grave challenges from pollution, overfishing, climate change, consumerism, and unsustainable practices within the clothing and retail industry. Matthew Parvis, the Founder and Executive Director of Fresh Clean Threads, is a San Diego resident who considers the beach his backyard. When he and his wife, Melissa, established the business, they ensured environmental conservation became an integral part of their guiding principles. We have big aspirations to become a truly sustainable brand for the future, and we are spending a lot of time and resources to do this as quickly as we possibly can. But to do that we also have to be here as a business, so we call that being sustainably sustainable. The   collection aligns with their sustainability initiative aimed at minimizing its impact on the ocean. The two primary focuses are   and  . The collection takes an additional step by sourcing recycled polyester as its fabric. Regarding this deliberate product decision, Matthew Parvis acknowledges, “What we are truly striving for at Fresh Clean Threads is to introduce innovative technologies that enable us to ensure that this polyester has a significantly reduced environmental impact.” Fresh Clean Threads is deeply committed to reducing its plastic consumption, particularly in packaging and shipping materials. As part of their sustainability journey, the company has made significant changes, such as replacing traditional poly-mailers with compostable mailers made from cornstarch. These innovative mailers break down within months, in stark contrast to the hundreds of years conventional plastic takes to degrade. According to Matthew Parvis, this transition represents the “second step” in their pursuit of becoming fully green. The first step involves making meaningful contributions to ocean conservation efforts, exemplified by their support for organizations like CORAL. The third step will ensure sustainable practices throughout the fabric production process by carefully selecting factories that share their values, all of which forms a crucial part of their responsible approach. In addition to their packaging changes, Fresh Clean Threads has eliminated plastic tape, opting instead for fully recyclable water-activated paper tape. Plastic packaging for their products has been replaced with compostable bags made from plant-based materials. Despite recognizing that ethical considerations may not always be the primary factor in purchasing decisions, the company considers these choices as fundamental pillars of their brand. Matthew Parvis expresses a strong desire for greater awareness of environmental issues, including the detrimental impact of companies, to take center stage. In the past, the company has partnered with a handful of non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting the world’s oceans, and CORAL is grateful to now be a part of the Fresh Clean Threads community. Beyond donating a portion of its profits to CORAL and being our match donor for our springtime campaign, our partners have dedicated their   collection to our mission. This decision heightens the awareness and urgency for coral conservation and best practices to Fresh Clean Threads’ consumer base. In this way, Fresh Clean Threads is a part of the solution instead of part of the problem.    Fresh Clean Threads has recognized the importance of sustainability and is taking concrete steps to reduce its impact on the environment. The Fresh Clean Seas initiative, focused on reducing single-use plastic and supporting ocean conservation efforts, is an excellent example of how businesses can be environmentally responsible while still being profitable. The driving ideology behind the company is “clothes that don’t wear on the planet.” This statement goes beyond the physical article of clothing, which has the potential of influencing its consumers for the greater good. Awareness provides shoppers the opportunity to make environmentally sustainable decisions all while educating them about the need for coral reef conservation. CORAL is proud to align itself with Fresh Clean Threads, and we’re enthusiastic to see this partnership grow. Join us on our journey to make the ocean a healthier place for those that live above and below its surface."

The app is called   and it’s a tool being used by conservationists around the world to protect wildlife and its natural habitats.  Thanks to our local partners, dedicated patrol rangers, and your generous support, we are expanding access to this technology and using it to address illegal fishing in the Western Caribbean and protect the region’s coral reefs.  SMART improves the management of marine protected areas by allowing patrol rangers to track activities and record observations in one simple data system. With just the click of a button, we can now view valuable data that helps on-the-ground teams be proactive, strategic, and efficient when guarding marine protected areas.  By providing training and access to the tool, our local partners like the   and the   have improved their patrolling programs and can better protect waters that suffer from illegal fishing.  “We can get precise information and immediately download the reports that we need,” says Francis Leán, the executive director for the RMP. According to Leán, her team no longer relies on estimations and can now accurately analyze the number of illegal fishing incidents and species confiscated, in addition to the mileage covered and amount of fuel used by patrol rangers.  “By using this technology, we understand all the components involved in running a successful patrolling program,” says Pamela Ortega, CORAL’s program manager. “It helps make informed decisions and it can advise other communities or groups in the industry.”  An effective patrol program is important because it protects healthy fish populations, which greatly contribute to coral reef health. Herbivorous fish, like parrotfish or surgeonfish, graze on the seaweed that grows near reefs. When you remove too many of these fish from the environment, algae can take over reef-building corals and the ecosystem can quickly collapse. Overfishing impacts coral reefs and the species that rely on them, in addition to many coastal communities who depend on reef fish as a source of income and food. That’s why we are so committed to our   strategy which includes utilizing technology, implementing robust patrolling programs, and supporting local partners whose work directly impacts coral reef health. In the upcoming year, we hope to expand the use of SMART and offer more technical expertise to patrolling programs in the Western Caribbean. Thanks to generous donations, we are able to help local communities and our partners reach these goals and protect the coral reefs we know and love. "

        "content": "So, picture this: you’ve just arrived at your dream tropical destination, ready to explore the crystal-clear waters and the vibrant underwater world. As you strap on your snorkeling gear and dive into the ocean, you’re immediately transported into a magical world of colors and shapes. The water is warm, the sun is shining, and the fish are curiously swimming around you. You feel like you’re in a dream. But suddenly, something catches your eye. As you approach a group of corals, you notice that something’s not quite right. The once-vibrant pink and green hues have faded, and the coral looks pale, white even. You swim closer, hoping it’s just a trick of the light, but as you get nearer, the reality sinks in: the coral is bleached. Corals are animals, but they live in a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae. These algae provide the corals with food and oxygen, and in return, the corals provide them with a safe place to live. It’s a win-win situation! However, when corals are exposed to stressful conditions, such as high temperatures, pollution, or changes in the water’s chemistry, they expel the zooxanthellae. Without them, the coral loses its color and turns white, hence the term “bleaching.” Corals can not live very long in this state. But here’s the good news: coral bleaching doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the reef. If the stressor is removed in time, the zooxanthellae can come back and the corals can recover. Together, we should care about coral bleaching because coral reefs are essential to the health of our oceans and our planet. They provide a home and a source of food for countless species of fish and other marine creatures. They also protect coastlines from erosion and storms, and play a vital role in regulating the Earth’s climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. When coral reefs suffer, so do the ecosystems and the people that depend on them. Additionally, coral reefs are a stunning display of biodiversity and natural beauty, and their loss would be a tragedy for future generations. By taking action to prevent and mitigate coral bleaching, we can help protect one of our planet’s most precious resources. The   at the Coral Reef Alliance is focused on early detection of bleaching events so that we can identify reefs in need of our protection.  For example, if a bleaching event has started in an area with many tourist divers, we can influence local stakeholders to limit visitors to that reef until it can have time to recover. Through this program we have collaborators monitoring events in the water and we are also partnering with the   to help improve their satellite-based technology  to identify bleaching in near-real time. There are many things you can do to help protect coral reefs and prevent coral bleaching. One of the most important is to reduce your carbon footprint by using less energy and supporting policies that address climate change. You can also reduce your impact on coral reefs by being a responsible traveler, choosing reef-safe sunscreens and more sustainable seafood, and avoiding activities that can damage coral, such as anchoring on reefs or touching coral. Finally, you can support organizations like the Coral Reef Alliance that work to protect and restore coral reefs around the world.  Coral bleaching is a serious threat to coral reefs and the many species that depend on them. By understanding the causes and impacts of coral bleaching and taking action to reduce our impact on the environment, we can help protect these important ecosystems for generations to come."

        "title": "CORAL Position Statement- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Releases Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5° C",
        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "On October 8th, the IPCC issued its special report on the impacts of global climate change on nature and society. Specifically, the IPCC examined the results of warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the context of the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. The report can be found at  . The report paints a grim picture of the consequences of climate change if the earth’s temperature rises by even 0.5°C and further states that rising temperatures will result in food shortages, more wildfires, and—of particular interest to us at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL)—a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Additionally, the report points out that the effects of climate change will not be disbursed uniformly across the globe. Rising temperatures will have a disproportionate impact on the poor as well as developing and island nations. CORAL works closely with many such communities around the world to implement solutions that are win-wins for both reefs and people. Many media outlets have covered the release of this report, and many have focused on the predictions of devastating effects to coral reefs. Some of the reports have shared inaccurate data about the current state of coral reefs and very few media outlets have publicized the work being done by CORAL and countless other conservation organizations around the world to save coral reefs. The IPCC’s special report is an urgent wake-up call for action. To save coral reefs, we must act on two fronts: we must swiftly and drastically   while simultaneously effectively  , such as from land-based sources of pollution and overfishing. Without effective action on both fronts in the next 20 years, we could be facing a world without functional coral reefs. CORAL has developed innovative, scientific solutions to meet this challenge. . A quarter of all marine life depends on coral reefs, and over 500 million people around the world rely on coral reefs for food security, economic well-being, and cultural identity. Goods and services—like tourism and fishing—derived from coral reefs have an estimated value of US$375 billion a year. Coral reefs are also critical for protecting coastal communities from wave action, erosion, and tropical storms. The world needs coral reefs, and decisive action will help ensure that we do not face a future without them. Many coral reefs around the globe are in a state of decline. Some recent reports in the media have stated that we have lost 50 percent of the world’s reefs already. The truth is more complicated. The combination of rising ocean temperatures and local reef threats has resulted in the loss of 50 percent of reef-building corals (as opposed to coral reefs) over the past 30 years and placed an estimated one-third of reef-building corals at risk of extinction. The good news is that there is hope for corals and coral reefs.  , but little is known about whether corals can adapt fast enough to keep up with the pace of climate change. Without this crucial information, pessimism can prevail, undermining motivation to implement effective conservation actions and governmental policies. CORAL is developing a new, scalable solution to meet the crisis facing our reefs, as described in the IPCC report, that will fill this knowledge gap. In partnership with world-class researchers, we are spearheading a multidisciplinary research project that is improving our understanding of how corals evolve in response to rising temperatures. We are using this scientific information to develop regional-scale conservation plans that we are implementing in collaboration with local communities in  ,  ,   and  . Our scientific research shows that the best way to give corals a fighting chance is by facilitating the natural process of evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue happens when a population in decline is able to survive because individuals that are naturally better suited to deal with new conditions breed to regrow the population. In essence, evolution rescues the population before it goes extinct. We have used our scientific research to define the attributes of networks that increase the probability of evolutionary rescue. We call these networks “Adaptive Reefscapes”. An Adaptive Reefscape is a network of healthy reefs that is diverse, connected, and large.  To learn more about Adaptive Reefscapes go to:  . A key element of Adaptive Reefscapes is that they are based on portfolio theory—the idea that investing in a diverse range of options for the future increases the chances for success. This contrasts with other approaches that use inherently uncertain forecasts to focus conservation efforts on particular geographic locations and/or species. Such strategies are intrinsically risky. Adaptive Reefscapes also contrasts with approaches that are over-reliant on technology which, given the short window of time and resource constraints, are unlikely to achieve meaningful results for reefs at a global scale. Given the rapid pace of climate change and its drastic effects, we can no longer rely on standard approaches to conservation that assume we know what the future will bring or that strive to return systems to the way they once were. We need innovative solutions that instead embrace the idea of change and harness evolutionary power. To address the crisis we face, we need a solution that can scale globally in a relatively short period and with limited resources. At CORAL, we have that solution. Find out how you can get involved and learn more at  . As CORAL’s Program Director, Dr. Madhavi Colton oversees an international portfolio of community-driven conservation programs that are addressing local threats to reefs, including over-fishing, poor water quality, sedimentation, and habitat destruction. Madhavi is also spearheading new scientific research into how ecosystems adapt to the effects of anthropogenic climate change and is applying this knowledge to develop innovative approaches to coral conservation around the world. Her expertise lies in building partnerships between academic researchers, conservation organizations, governments and local communities to implement durable solutions to conservation.

        "content": "Coral reefs are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, providing critical habitat for countless species of fish, invertebrates, and other marine life. Unfortunately, coral reefs are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms. This has led to a decline in the health and resilience of many coral reefs, which in turn has negatively impacted the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them for food, income, and cultural identity. To address these challenges, a team of researchers from University of Leeds (UK), Coral Reef Alliance (USA), Rare (Philippines & Indonesia), Pattimura University (Indonesia), and many other partners are  . These two nations are part of “The Coral Triangle” – a region in the western Pacific Ocean that is known for its incredible marine biodiversity and rich coral reef ecosystems. It is often referred to as the “Amazon of the Seas” due to its vast array of marine life and is considered one of the most important and diverse marine regions on Earth.  The new project is called  Led by Dr. Maria Beger of University of Leeds, Rocky Sanchez-Tirona of Rare, Dr. Gino Limmon of Pattimura University, and Dr. Helen Fox of CORAL, the project will   that depend on them. In particular, Climate REEFS aims to both develop techniques to identify adaptive reefs using remote sensing technologies and characterize how gender and social status shape socio-economic vulnerabilities and the ability to adapt to reef degradation. Its ultimate goal is to strengthen community capacity for sustainable fisheries and to improve management of coral reef marine protected areas (MPAs). Climate REEFS will involve a range of activities, including social science research to identify climate vulnerability and gender- and socially inclusive adaptation pathways. It also involves geospatial research to detect adaptive reefs from satellite-derived data, as well as ecological and genomic research to pilot an analysis that tests the interplay of adaptiveness from genes to people. All activities will be conducted at a small scale, with the goal of training the team in key research techniques and identifying policy opportunities that will enable future expansion. Climate REEFS officially kicked off in the city of Cebu, the Philippines, where partners met from July 3 – 5 to discuss major work packages, finalize project timelines, and flesh out plans for the start of gathering data in the field, among other agenda items. The project team is currently working to select field sites for ecological coral reef surveys off the island of Leyte in the Philippines and is also working with nearby coastal communities. It’s expected that similar efforts will begin off the island of Ambon, Indonesia in October.   You can help us expand our work in the Coral Triangle by following the Climate REEFS project and sharing about it with friends, family, and followers. The more people who know about this work, the better. We’re confident this sharing of knowledge will influence how other communities manage their coral reef resources and influence donors to fund coral conservation and science."

        "content": "In the crystal clear waters surrounding Molokai, the legacy of Ka Honua Momona (KHM) spans generations, rooted in the island’s rich heritage. Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and Ka Honua Momona have recently joined hands in a shared commitment to preserving Hawaii’s precious coastal ecosystems. Their partnership aims to safeguard Molokai’s southern fringing reefs, a mission deeply woven into the longstanding dedication of KHM to this land. Hawaii’s coral reefs are not merely underwater ecosystems; they’re the lifeblood of the islands, sustaining nature, economy, and culture. The reefs of Molokai, with their rich biodiversity and cultural significance, face a looming crisis. Invasive species, mismanaged land, and unsustainable fishing are threatening to irreversibly damage these precious ecosystems, jeopardizing not only marine life but also the traditions, livelihoods, and well-being of the local communities. Studies by scientists at the University of Hawaii’s Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program have shown that south Molokai has the best coral coverage in the main eight Hawaiian Islands. Yet the impacts from sediment run-off into the nearshore ecosystem have caused areas of degradation of the south Molokai reef, affecting fish and coral habitats. Coral and fish larvae from this island are dispersed across Maui Nui and Oahu, helping to build resilience across a larger area. Molokai’s south shore is a close-knit community, primarily home to native Hawaiians whose families have lived on the island for generations. They’re deeply committed to preserving their unique Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions. Unfortunately, the island faces challenges due to limited job opportunities, leading to high unemployment rates and many residents living below the poverty line. Most available jobs are in agriculture, mainly with external companies managing plantations on the island. The community is aging as younger generations leave in search of better prospects. By teaming up with KHM for this project, we aim to support the community in maintaining their vital sources of food and income. Additionally, our research will assist in developing strategies for a sustainable future. The CORAL-KHM fishpond restoration project is a lifeline thrown into troubled waters, aiming to set Molokai’s reefs on a course of resilience and sustainability. Revitalizing two fishponds—named Alii and Kalokoeli—will significantly enhance the long-term health of the coral reefs along Molokai’s south shore.  This restoration effort involves removing invasive algae, reintroducing native plant species, and rejuvenating fish ponds to boost the fish population, which is crucial for nurturing healthy coral habitats. By creating healthier reef ecosystems, we’re not only promoting resilience but also fortifying the region against the impact of storms, hurricanes, and rising sea levels. Molokai hosts coral species found nowhere else in the world. We must protect these endemic species from extinction, ensuring the survival of unique marine life integral to the delicate balance of the ecosystem. Beyond ecological considerations, the project recognizes the intrinsic link between healthy reefs and Hawaiian culture. The revival of the reefs is an endeavor to safeguard cultural practices, ceremonies, and the traditional gathering of marine resources that have sustained communities for generations. We’ll be working in tight partnership with KHM whose staff have lineal ties to place and have kuleana (responsibility) in caring for Alii and Kalokoeli fishponds, which are community treasures and sources of education, food, cultural renewal and connection. As a result of this project’s efforts to improve habitat for fish and wildlife, we anticipate a simultaneous enhancement of community resilience. By addressing land mismanagement, invasive species, and sediment pollution, the project also aims to secure the economic lifeline that Molokai’s reefs provide. A thriving marine ecosystem provides a sustainable source of income and food for local communities. Hunting, fishing, and farming account for providing 33% of the island community’s food needs, and this reef is one of the major food sources for Molokai’s subsistence economy. As climate change intensifies, coral reefs face unprecedented challenges. One of our goals is to create conditions that enable reefs to adapt to the changing climate, ensuring their resilience in the face of warming oceans and other climate-related stressors. This includes healthy fish populations, as well as clean water free of sedimentation. Our future plans include establishing water quality monitoring protocols to ensure the reefs have proper conditions, as well as education around restoration and sustainable initiatives on the island. Through fishpond restoration, water quality monitoring, and community capacity-building, the CORAL-KHM partnership is not just about addressing immediate threats but building a foundation for long-term coral reef management. It’s a commitment to a sustainable future where Molokai’s reefs thrive, supporting ecosystems, cultures, and economies for generations to come."

This is why CORAL and our local patterns are working diligently to protect them in the Bay Islands of Honduras where protective   are in place, but unfortunately are not always abided by the fishing community due to social and economic pressures.  Preserving lobsters and conchs is crucial for the long-term health of reef ecosystems, but their populations have been declining due to overfishing and a lack of effective regulation. To help address these issues, CORAL’s Western Caribbean team is   for lobster and conch made possible by a grant financed by Ingvar Bundgaard Jensen Fund. This project aims to comprehensively assess the status of both the Caribbean spiny lobster ( ) and the queen conch ( ) in the Bay Islands of Honduras as well as to    The structure of this project recognizes the importance of engaging fishers and communities in management decisions in order to improve the social and economic circumstances of coastal communities. By tackling this intersection of marine conservation and livelihood sustainability, CORAL helps safeguard the health of coral reefs  . Through this initiative, CORAL will support co-managers with ground-truthed science. This will help them make well-informed decisions to   CORAL scientists, alongside local partners, will be surveying the Bay Islands, revising marine species monitoring protocols, and collaborating with the patrols of the Bay Islands National Park (a marine protected area).

By providing economic benefits for nearly 5,000 people involved in small-scale fisheries, CORAL seeks to facilitate an   dependent on coral reefs in the face of climate change. To address issues of overfishing in this region, CORAL and key collaborators from the Bay Islands National Marine Park Technical Committee – such as the ICF Honduras: National Institute of Forest Conservation, Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA), Roatan Marine Park, and others – recently developed  . The protocol emphasizes the regular monitoring of lobster and conch populations, as well as their habitats. Collaborative research efforts enable scientists to better understand the ecological dynamics and make informed decisions for sustainable management. Through comprehensive studies, community engagement, and sustainable management practices, we hope that this protocol will safeguard Caribbean spiny lobsters and queen conchs for the   of the communities in the Bay Islands. Lobsters and conchs may not receive as much attention as corals when discussing reef ecosystems, but   As key players in food chain dynamics, habitat engineering, algae control, and sediment stabilization, these fascinating creatures play a crucial role in the overall health and resilience of coral reefs.

While many methods exist, our Western Caribbean Science and Programs teams partnered with others to create a  . The document is straightforward and provides a way for everyone to draw from the same framework and toward the same goal…to save our reefs from contaminants deriving from poor water quality. This protocol was made possible by multiple partners and monitoring efforts across 90 sites in Mexico, Belize, and Honduras. We’re happy to share our universal water quality monitoring protocol that can be used anywhere and everywhere reefs exist. This labor of love has been a group effort for over a decade, and we believe this protocol will make an immediate impact when implemented correctly and consistently. Reef health is getting worse as years go by. In order to minimize stressors to the reef, we must first understand the cause. Is the decline caused by a lack of fish? Pollution? Sanitation issues? In recent years, the MAR has been facing a major challenge – an increase in macroalgae that threatens its coral reefs. These blooms grow on corals, prevent larval settlement, and compete for space. This is due to low herbivore populations and nutrient contamination from wastewater management and agricultural activities. To tackle this problem,  . The program is divided into two phases:  focuses on quantifying the human impacts derived from wastewater in priority sites where tourism has the most impact. Control sites that aren’t influenced by tourism-related fluctuations will also be included to provide quantitative data.   will expand the sampling sites to assess nutrient enrichment from other sources.  Five sampling locations have been identified in each of the three most tourism-affected MAR countries – Honduras, Belize, and Mexico. These will be divided into three locations impacted by tourism and two control locations. Water quality parameters will be sampled monthly to quantify any changes in water quality. This handbook was created for anyone who wants to get involved in water quality management.   We believe that a consistent approach to monitoring water quality can lead to more resilient reefs. By monitoring marine water quality, we can assess the health of our oceans and human impact on our marine ecosystem. This helps us to implement mitigation actions to prevent environmental degradation and protect marine life. Let’s all do our part to protect our oceans and preserve them for generations to come!"

        "content": "When improperly treated sewage enters the marine environment, it can have devastating effects on a coral reef. Not only does it bring bacteria that can pose a threat to human health, but it also brings nutrients that fuel the growth of algae—a fierce competitor in the coral reef ecosystem. Algae compete with corals for space, and if not controlled, can quickly overtake a coral reef ecosystem. That’s why at CORAL we focus so heavily on making sure corals have the clean, clear water they need to thrive. And it’s why we’ve been partnering with the local community in West End, Roatán, Honduras since 2013 to help   to ensure the plant is operational and homes are connected to it. It’s working—together with our partners, we decreased the amount of bacteria in the nearshore waters of Half Moon Bay by more than 98 percent between 2013 and 2020. The water along the coast of western Roatán is once again healthy and clean. “The numbers are amazing,” said Dr. Antonella Rivera, CORAL’s Principal Investigator in Honduras. “There is a huge difference in the before and after. It’s hard to believe it can actually happen in such a short period of time, and it’s also very fulfilling and motivating for me to see. You think you’ll see a little bit of change, but not of that magnitude.” These impressive statistics are proof that partnering with communities and making long-term investments to improve local conditions can pay big dividends for coral reefs, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Water quality has improved so much that West End has been  , a third-party certification that recognizes safe, accessible and sustainable beaches. This is a huge success for the people who swim, play, and work in these waters—they now have clean water and don’t have to worry about getting sick. But these remarkable improvements are also helping coral reefs become healthier. Though further research is needed, our scientists believe there’s a link between water quality and coral disease, which stresses corals and can lead to bleaching. When sewage pollution decreased in Half Moon Bay, the prevalence of coral disease also decreased. From 2011 to 2016, coral disease dropped from 25 percent to zero in the region, leading our researchers to believe that the pathogens and nutrients in untreated wastewater are harmful to corals’ health. “Before we started monitoring in Half Moon Bay, the level of disease was very high,” Dr. Rivera said. “But we’ve monitored that with our partners, Healthy Reefs Initiative, every two years and, in 2016 and 2018, disease levels had gone down to zero. We can’t say that this is conclusively because of water quality improvements—disease can also happen because of other stressors such as climate change and other types of pollutants—but reducing the amount of sewage in the ocean likely contributes to making cleaner, healthier water for these coral reefs so they can be healthy and disease-free.” To address this, Dr. Rivera is leading efforts to expand water quality testing in the Mesoamerican region to give us a better understanding of sewage-related impacts on the coral reef ecosystem."

The 5-week class, Reef-Friendly Shoreline Innovations, is designed to teach watershed stewardship and landscape design principles to shoreline property owners in an effort to reduce threats to Maui’s coral reefs. According to an economic valuation study conducted in 2002, Hawaiian coral reefs contribute an average of $364 million annually to the Hawaiian economy. But coral reefs around the Main Hawaiian Islands are being threatened by poor water quality, much of which is caused by rainwater running off of the land and entering the marine environment, bringing with it pesticides, herbicides, nutrients, and sediment—all of which are harmful to reefs. “In this course we’ll talk a lot about Low Impact Design, which focuses on using plants and landscape designs to catch stormwater and prevent it from entering our oceans,” says Wes Crile, Hawai‘i field manager for CORAL and one of the course instructors. “The concepts are incredibly easy to implement, and can really help Maui’s reefs recover from a lot of the stress they’ve been under.” The new Reef-Friendly Shoreline Innovations course will cater to shoreline property owners, managers, landscapers, and residents interested in reef-friendly landscaping. The course will cover the fundamentals of Low Impact Design (LID), irrigation management, plant selection, visitor and community engagement, and more. Field trips to visit reef-friendly landscapes at various hotels are included. The class will take place on Thursday afternoons from 2:00-4:30pm, from April 23 to May 21, 2015.

        "content": "— Today, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) released a highly anticipated Preliminary Engineering Report that charts the path forward for protecting one of the most significant reefs in the main Hawaiian Islands. The report puts forth a formal recommendation for a new, community-wide sewage treatment facility. Over the years, Puakō residents noticed a decline in reef health and came together to protect their reef, enlisting researchers and local nonprofit organizations to assist in their efforts. In response, CORAL formed and facilitates the Clean Water for Reefs Puakō project and   to ensure a broad and collective voice among the community and local partners. The  , completed by AQUA Engineering, a respected firm that specializes in wastewater treatment, is a thorough analysis of three potential wastewater treatment solutions for the Puakō community, including Aerobic Treatment Units (ATUs), connection to the Kalahuipua’a Lagoons (Mauna Lani) facility, and a dedicated onsite treatment facility. “The onsite treatment facility will provide the best environmental results for the Puakō community and its reefs,” said Erica Perez, Hawai‘i program manager for CORAL, “It also has the highest treatment quality and the lowest 20-year life cycle cost, with 100 percent effluent reuse.” A key challenge for wastewater treatment in Puakō is the proximity of residential properties to the shoreline, combined with the geology—very porous volcanic rock and high groundwater. This means that any polluted water released from residential treatment units can make its way to the reefs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated the South Kohala region, including Puakō, as a Coral Priority Management Site through its Habitat Blueprint initiative. The Puakō reef is also recognized by The State Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) and the South Kohala Coastal Partnership as a priority area for ridge-to-reef management through the South Kohala Conservation Action Plan. Next steps for the project include securing necessary land and permits, determining management and ownership options, outlining funding avenues, and a developing a long-term monitoring plan and citizen science group.

        "content": "Monday, July 1, 2019 — A   released today in Nature Climate Change gives hope for coral reefs. The pioneering study launched by the Coral Reef Alliance is one of the first to demonstrate that management that takes evolution and adaptation into account can help rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change. Importantly, the results show that by making smart decisions to protect reefs today, conservation managers can generate the conditions that can help corals adapt to rising temperatures. “It is well documented that climate change is causing corals to die off at an unprecedented rate, but our study provides tools that offer promise for their survival,” stated Dr. Madhavi Colton, co-author and Program Director at the Coral Reef Alliance. “Our results show that when evolution is enabled, conservation efforts can help corals adapt to rising temperatures.” Contrary to approaches that are popular today, such as focusing protection on reefs in cooler water, the study shows that protecting diverse reef habitat types across a spectrum of ocean conditions is key to helping corals adapt to climate change. “We found that a diversity of reef types provides the variety that evolution depends on,” explained co-author Malin Pinsky, Associate-Professor at Rutgers University. “Hot sites are important sources of heat-tolerant corals, while cold sites and those in between can become important future habitats. Together, a diversity of reef types act as stepping stones that give corals the best chance for adapting and moving as climate changes.” Key to successful evolution is management that improves local conditions for reefs by effectively reducing local stressors, such as overfishing and water pollution. However, the authors caution that not all management strategies are created equal. “We used mathematical models to test the effects of management choices on coral reef outlooks,” stated Dr. Tim Walsworth, lead author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington. “We found that corals in well-managed areas act a source of baby corals in the future, essentially rescuing reefs after the climate stabilizes. Without both evolution and management, the corals in our model were unable to survive rising temperatures.” Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and support the livelihoods of over 500 million people. Globally, they are estimated to be worth US$375 billion per year. The study shows that managing reefs to facilitate evolution today and in the future can enhance their prospects for long-term survival. This means creating managed area networks that contain a diversity of coral types and habitats and that effectively reduce local stressors. “This study shows that we know enough of the science to act—and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste,” says Dr. Colton. The study titled,   is the result of a collaborative research program launched by Dr. Madhavi Colton and Dr. Michael Webster of the Coral Reef Alliance.

Rogers is a volunteer with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), helping to grow native plants that will be transplanted at their stream restoration site in Wahikuli. The native plants trap sediment that runs off the slope and into the ocean where it smothers coral reefs. Typically, CORAL purchases the plants and hosts volunteer planting days at the stream restoration site. But when COVID-19 restrictions hit and the group planting days were no longer safe, the team put a call out to volunteers to grow the plants at home from seed. “I really wanted to do things for the environment, but had not found a way to really help besides not using a straw or bringing my own bags to the store,” says Rogers. “My mom read about [the CORAL project] in a newspaper article and suggested it to me.” Originally, Rogers signed up to take home three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But once she realized how much fun it was, she signed up for 15 more kits. That brings her total to 900 native plants. Rogers has certainly taken the plunge into her first-ever volunteer project. “I have always been interested in the environment because I have always wanted to help the world,” says the 5 th grader. “I spent seven years in China, where I learned firsthand about air and water pollution. Now, living in Hawai‘i, I have been looking for ways I can make a positive impact on the environment.” Rogers is one of 100 volunteers who signed up to grow 25,000 seeds for CORAL. Since not all seeds tend to germinate, CORAL estimates that about 10,000 plants will ultimately be transplanted. “She’s our most prolific volunteer,” says Larissa Treese, CORAL’s Program Coordinator on Maui and the coordinator behind the at-home plant growing volunteer program. “It’s so great seeing the next generation stepping up to save coral reefs—the amount of sediment we’ll be able to trap with the plants she’s growing will definitely have an impact.” Once a volunteer signs up to participate, CORAL provides them with the seeds and instructions on how to grow them. Volunteers can choose whether to donate the rest of the supplies (soil, trays and pots) or whether to borrow them from CORAL. Once the plants are fully grown, the volunteer can return them to CORAL to be transplanted or they can visit the restoration site and transplant them themselves. CORAL has been engaged in slope restoration in West Maui for several years, using native plants and trees to restore Maui’s once lush forests and reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. The key to CORAL’s success is building strong local partnerships. The restoration project in Wahikuli is a testament to that, bringing together partners like Maui Nui Botanical Gardens, West Maui Ridge 2 Reef and Down the Hatch. “The at-home native plant kits have been a terrific way to bring the community together and keep our volunteers engaged, since we can’t meet in person anymore,” says Treese. “It’s also helped us save the money that we would typically spend on purchasing the fully grown plants.” To sign up to volunteer and receive your own at-home native planting kit, email Larissa Treese at ltreese@coral.org. This project is funded by Hawai‘i Tourism Authority and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is a nonprofit focused on saving the world’s coral reefs. At the local level, CORAL partners with communities in Hawai‘i and Honduras to design lasting conservation programs that protect both the coral reefs and the communities that depend upon them. At the global level, CORAL is actively expanding the scientific understanding of how corals adapt to climate change and using that information to develop conservation strategies to give corals around the world the best chance of surviving climate change.

        "content": "September 9, 2014   Nyoman Sugiarta, a fisherman from Bali, has been selected by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) as the inaugural 2014 CORAL Conservation Prize winner. Sugiarta will receive $20,000 for his leadership and dedication protecting coral reefs, and will travel to the United States later this month to collect his prize. “The CORAL Conservation Prize celebrates some of the most remarkable coral reef conservation leaders and provides them with necessary resources to continue their important work,” says CORAL’s Executive Director Michael Webster. “We’re excited to have Nyoman as the inaugural winner, and hope his successful conservation program can offer guidance and inspiration to other leaders around the world.” Sugiarta was chosen for his work protecting and monitoring coral reefs off the coast of Bondalem, Bali. With the support of Reef Check Indonesia, Sugiarta and his team have built a strong network of support for reef protection and have created a marine protected area (MPA). “At first, I didn’t know much about coral reefs and didn’t know why Reef Check Indonesia was coming to my village. They kept trying to tell us corals were important for the fish and for providing protection against waves,” says Sugiarta. “But now I understand what corals are, and how important they are.” Sugiarta volunteers his time monitoring reefs with Reef Check Indonesia, and is the leader of the MPA’s citizen enforcement team. He and his team have set up a successful monitoring program for their MPA, and patrol the beach regularly. They also conduct regular underwater cleanups. Sugiarta is dedicated to supporting fishermen, and encourages more sustainable fishing practices. “The reef looks much better now than it did before we created the MPA because we stopped fisherman from neighboring villages from using cyanide poison on the reef,” says Sugiarta. “We also stopped fishermen from using bottom nets, which, as far as I know, damage the reef and the environment permanently.” The area currently has two fish aggravating devices (FADs), designed to decrease the local fishing pressure on reef fish. The FADs, built by Sugiarta and his team, attract pelagic fish; research has found them to be very successful in providing more fishing opportunities for fishermen, while simultaneously taking pressure off near-shore reef fish populations. Sugiarta has big plans to put his prize money back into his program. “I want to buy mooring buoys to mark the MPA boundaries, and I want to buy a patrol boat complete with an outboard machine. I also want to develop a program for elementary schools to be able to come to the area and learn about conservation.” Additionally, he hopes to use part of his new funds to build four more FADs and continue supporting the Bondalem fishing community. CORAL will present Sugiarta with his award on September 20, 2014 at the CORAL 20  Anniversary Gala at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. It will be Sugiarta’s first trip to the United States, and he couldn’t be more excited. “I can’t sleep at night because I know I’m coming to the big country,” says Sugiarta. “I still feel like I’m dreaming.” To learn more about Sugiarta and the CORAL 20  Anniversary Gala, visit  .   The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) unites communities to save coral reefs.

        "content": "October 28, 2014 According to a new publication by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), protecting coral reefs and the natural environment can help hotel’s grow their business. Ecotourists have higher incomes than regular tourists on average, and they tend to spend more money while traveling. Attracting this growing market could help hotels increase their bottom line. Over $24 billion was spent in 2005 on ecotourism—and in a 2007 study by the Center for Responsible Travel, 54 percent of respondents said they would be more likely to patronize hotels and resorts that were environmentally responsible. Today’s tourists are seeking genuine natural experiences, and they’re becoming more aware and discerning of false environmental advertising, or greenwashing. Additionally, healthy reefs and clean water are essential to maintaining Hawai‘i’s allure as a destination—80 percent of Hawai‘i’s nearly 8 million annual visitors engage in marine-related recreational activities during their stay. The new Hawai‘i Hotel Reef Stewardship Guide is designed to help hotels adopt practices that protect coral reefs and attract this growing number of tourists interested in supporting environmentally-friendly businesses. The new guide by CORAL, available for free download at  , outlines practical steps hotels can take to become coral reef stewards, such as reducing land-based pollution and engaging and educating their guests. To receive a hardcopy of this guide, those within the South Kohala accommodations sector—including property division managers, maintenance and facility personnel, and elected homeowner association board members—are invited to a free workshop to learn more about reef stewardship. Participants will learn about attracting eco-friendly travelers, becoming a certified environmentally-friendly business, saving money through reef stewardship, and the history of the local shoreline and Hawaiian culture. The workshop will take place on Wednesday, November 12, 2014 from 8:30am-4:30pm at the Ka‘upulehu Interpretive Center in Kailua-Kona. Interested attendees should RSVP by November 3 to Erica Perez at   or 808.494.5770. Lunch and refreshments will be provided. CORAL unites communities to save coral reefs.

        "content": "Thanks to David Welder for asking about the difference between parrotfish and wrasses; he thought the image on the coin looked remarkably like a Maori wrasse ( ) and was curious about how they are related to the humphead parrotfish. Turns out it looked like a Maori wrasse because it is one! We obviously did not examine the mouth on the fish closely enough. These wrasses have large, succulent lips, not the toothier grins of the reef-grinding parrotfish.   Maori wrasse is a common name for several different species of wrasse.   (the Fijian species on the coin) is also confusingly known as the Napoleon wrasse, humphead wrasse, Napoleon fish, and Napoleonfish.  Wrasses belong to the family Labridae, and the Maori wrasse is the largest living member of the family. Males can be as long as six feet, and females about three feet. Males change color, from electric blue to pale green, blue-green, or purplish blue; females and juveniles are red-orange above and red-orange to white below. Although wrasses are long-lived, they are slow breeders, and their numbers have declined due to intensive fishing pressures, collection for aquariums, and habitat destruction and degradation, among other problems.   Though long been considered a different family, because of genetic similarities many scientists now regard parrotfish as a subfamily of Labridae.   Here is a selection of some of the other questions we received—and answers from CORAL’s experts.   The answer to this question is more complicated than you might think! It depends on the species of parrotfish—and how big they are. Scientists estimate that one stoplight parrotfish can process and generate about 0.6 pounds of sand per day on average.   Some species of parrotfish produce mucus from glands behind their gills, secrete it from their mouths, and then spread it over their bodies and heads, creating a sleeping bag or cocoon that protects them from tiny blood-sucking shrimp-like parasites at night—similar to people using mosquito nets. Sleeping fish are particularly vulnerable to parasites at night when cleaner fish and shrimp are off the clock. Studies show that when the fish are not protected by their mucus cocoons, their parasite loads increase by about nine-fold. And if a predator like a moray eel nudges the protective membrane of the cocoon, parrotfish can feel this vibration and flee. Parrotfish spend about 2.5 percent of their daily energy budget to create their nighttime protection systems.         Of course! Most of our projects are located in areas where tourism represents a significant part of the local economy, so you can definitely visit them. We have been working longest with the Kubulau community in Fiji, where the nearby Namena Marine Reserve shows high fish biomass and diversity compared to sites nearby that don’t enjoy the same level of protection. Trips to Namena can be arranged from resorts in Savusavu or enjoyed from live-aboards in the area. Another great option is the West End of Roatan, Honduras, where—thanks in part to our work with the Roatan Marine Park—fish populations are rebounding. For a special treat, arrange a trip to Cordelia Banks—the coral cover will blow your mind."

By providing micro-grants, helping them build capacity with tools or trainings, or sharing additional targeted resources, CORAL—through Jenny—has catalyzed the work of these individuals and helped put into place a skilled and diverse team fighting for Honduras’s reefs. Without these passionate, local activists—without all of us working together—coral reef conservation would not be happening at the scale or the rate it is in Honduras.

        "content": "The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), our partners in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and the people of Roatán celebrated a major win as a decade of work recently came to fruition when the island passed clean water standards for the first time since monitoring began in 2013. The island of Roatán, part of the Bay Islands of Honduras, is world-renowned for its colorful reefs, white sand beaches, and clear waters. Over a million tourists visit this small island each year, contributing over 1 billion US dollars to the Honduran economy. About a decade ago, CORAL and partners realized that polluted ocean water in Roatán was beginning to threaten coral reef health and human health — and with it, the tourism industry and local economy. CORAL began working with the communities of West End and Half Moon Bay on Roatán, where – due to a lack of funding and few alternatives – the majority of homes and businesses were discharging their wastewater directly into the environment, resulting in unsafe levels of fecal bacteria along the coast. CORAL and partners stepped in to help resolve chronic ocean pollution problems resulting from wastewater by conducting water quality monitoring, building the capacity of local organizations to manage water resources, and connecting nearly 300 homes and businesses to a nearby wastewater treatment facility. [Best_Wordpress_Gallery id=”23″ gal_title=”Wastewater Treatment in Roatán”] Today, the water in Roatán is now passing clean water standards, with a 95% reduction in fecal bacteria since our water quality monitoring began in 2013. The amount of raw sewage discharged into the coastal environment has been reduced by nearly 30 million gallons per year. Ninety-seven percent of the homes and businesses that can be connected to a water treatment facility are connected. As a result of providing clean water, the most recent coral health survey showed a dramatic drop in coral disease from 25% in 2011 to zero in 2018. CORAL proudly celebrated the declaration of West End as a Blue Flag beach last year. Blue Flag certification comes from a third party that validates marine water quality, freshwater availability, and garbage disposal practices. This is a remarkable achievement, as West End previously did not pass safe swimming standards. Our success in Roatán is a rallying cry for others across the Bay Islands and Honduras to tackle this issue, and we are seeing results as government entities, local communities, and the private sector are increasing their commitment to addressing wastewater issues. We’re continuing to work closely with these stakeholders to improve local conditions and provide clean water for coral reefs in the region. Efforts like these are creating the local conditions that allow healthy corals to thrive, and because this work is part of a network, these reefs contribute to adaptation and repopulation of corals across the entire Mesoamerican Reef system. We will continue to support our local partners in their efforts to reduce local stressors so that corals can adapt to the effects of climate change and continue to support the people of the Mesoamerican Region."

        "content": "When improperly treated sewage enters the marine environment, it can have devastating effects on a coral reef. Not only does it bring bacteria that can pose a threat to human health, but it also brings nutrients that fuel the growth of algae—a fierce competitor in the coral reef ecosystem. Algae compete with corals for space, and if not controlled, can quickly overtake a coral reef ecosystem. That’s why at CORAL we focus so heavily on making sure corals have the clean, clear water they need to thrive. And it’s why we’ve been partnering with the local community in West End, Roatán, Honduras since 2013 to help   to ensure the plant is operational and homes are connected to it. It’s working—together with our partners, we decreased the amount of bacteria in the nearshore waters of Half Moon Bay by more than 98 percent between 2013 and 2020. The water along the coast of western Roatán is once again healthy and clean. “The numbers are amazing,” said Dr. Antonella Rivera, CORAL’s Principal Investigator in Honduras. “There is a huge difference in the before and after. It’s hard to believe it can actually happen in such a short period of time, and it’s also very fulfilling and motivating for me to see. You think you’ll see a little bit of change, but not of that magnitude.” These impressive statistics are proof that partnering with communities and making long-term investments to improve local conditions can pay big dividends for coral reefs, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Water quality has improved so much that West End has been  , a third-party certification that recognizes safe, accessible and sustainable beaches. This is a huge success for the people who swim, play, and work in these waters—they now have clean water and don’t have to worry about getting sick. But these remarkable improvements are also helping coral reefs become healthier. Though further research is needed, our scientists believe there’s a link between water quality and coral disease, which stresses corals and can lead to bleaching. When sewage pollution decreased in Half Moon Bay, the prevalence of coral disease also decreased. From 2011 to 2016, coral disease dropped from 25 percent to zero in the region, leading our researchers to believe that the pathogens and nutrients in untreated wastewater are harmful to corals’ health. “Before we started monitoring in Half Moon Bay, the level of disease was very high,” Dr. Rivera said. “But we’ve monitored that with our partners, Healthy Reefs Initiative, every two years and, in 2016 and 2018, disease levels had gone down to zero. We can’t say that this is conclusively because of water quality improvements—disease can also happen because of other stressors such as climate change and other types of pollutants—but reducing the amount of sewage in the ocean likely contributes to making cleaner, healthier water for these coral reefs so they can be healthy and disease-free.” To address this, Dr. Rivera is leading efforts to expand water quality testing in the Mesoamerican region to give us a better understanding of sewage-related impacts on the coral reef ecosystem."

        "content": "The social sciences have historically been more intertwined with terrestrial conservation than with their marine counterpart. The notion of incorporating social science into conservation efforts began with the concept of Integrated Conservation and Development Programs (ICDPs), which aimed to simultaneously meet development and conservation goals. While the results of these projects were mixed, it remains a commonly used concept, carried out under the more commonly known term of  “community-based natural resource management” or “community-based conservation.” Through these programs, conservation groups, particularly in the developing world, are increasingly incorporating social needs into their strategies. Socially integrative concepts like co-management, Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFs), and Rapid Assessment techniques are now more prevalent in coral reef conservation as well. All of these structures and tools incorporate social science principles. Today it seems that taking human needs and desires into account is recognized as being irrevocably linked to conservation, yet community members are still sometimes brought in as an afterthought. Pursuing conservation is inherently a social endeavor, which means that taking humans into account as part of the ecosystem is invaluable to our work as conservationists. As our field staff around the world can attest, entering a community with preconceived ideas and plans doesn’t always work out. Particularly when dealing with marine conservation and a local community that depends on the resources of the sea, our approach must be open and humble. As referenced in a recent paper by Hicks et al.,  “human values need to be considered in all decision-making”–and these values and priorities can differ greatly. CORAL has found that entering a community with an active ear, ready to work with all stakeholders to find common ground, is the best approach. When working with different cultures it is easy to project our own perceptions onto a situation. Instead, the community’s interpretations, perceptions, and desires must be expressed, understood, and incorporated from the beginning. CORAL adopts these lessons from social science and employs them in our approach. This framework for engagement can be seen in our programs in Fiji, Honduras, and Indonesia. In these countries, we have worked alongside and in collaboration with local communities, ensuring that their concerns and needs receive priority. In Fiji, we consulted with community members and local stakeholders numerous times in designing a user fee system that respected their goals and authorities. The result was a broadly accepted program that achieved high local compliance. Conservation success can never be achieved without the compliance and support of human beings. Conducting socioeconomic studies and engaging the community prior to coming to conclusions regarding problems and solutions ensures that the actual and perceived issues are addressed, with collaboration and buy-in from all.

After his teacher decided to hold a Tzedakah (in Hebrew, “doing a good deed”) and parents created a fund to benefit nonprofit organizations, the 30 students in Gavin’s grade researched a variety of potential beneficiaries, then gave presentations about them. The students gave each of the nonprofits a donation, but chose three favorites to receive the largest awards. Gavin’s choice, CORAL, came in third, and on January 23, he presented CORAL’s Executive Director, Dr. Michael Webster, with a check for $725. Gavin says he “thought CORAL looked the best” of the coral reef conservation organizations he researched. In his five-page essay assignment, he writes, “People are not doing much about the dying coral reefs, but the Coral Reef Alliance is working to end this… Do you want your children, or your children’s children to see the beautiful coral reefs, or do you want it to be a story, something you wouldn’t be able to go and see? You and I might not be able to witness a change in our lives, but if we act strongly and carefully, there might be a future for the coral reefs.” Gavin says he is motivated by his love for all animals-from his two cats to the tiny fish and other creatures that live on coral reefs. He was taught since pre-kindergarten that “everything counts” and needs to be treated with respect. After seeing a documentary at the California Academy of Sciences about coral reefs, he realized that “we have only a certain amount of time to save them. I learned that lots of animals’ lives depend on the reef … The future of coral reefs around the world is in our own hands.”"

The environment is a job for everybody; we need to stop blaming and judging each other and work together.” Nan is walking that talk in Indonesia-and she’s having a lot of success. In 2013, after years of advocacy, CORAL, Conservation International, and The Nature Conservancy persuaded the Raja Ampat government to sign a shark and manta ray sanctuary (that had been declared in 2010) into law. The law protects sharks and rays in 46,000 square kilometers (18,000 square miles) of ocean off the coast of Raja Ampat. And for the past three years, CORAL’s Indonesian field team has been gathering community input—from fishermen, business operators, and government officials—on plans for a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) off the coast of Bali. Born in Bandung, West Java, Nan has been a field manager for CORAL since 2009. She always loved nature, spending lots of time in “mud, a river, and a little forest” near her home. In college, biology was one of her easiest subjects. But it was her father’s observation—that Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world with 17,500 islands but limited human resources to manage them—that nudged her in the direction of coral reefs and marine biology. After finishing postgraduate work at Bandung Institute of Technology and the School of Environmental Science at the University of East Anglia in the UK, Nan worked for the World Wildlife Fund and Reef Check Foundation, two organizations with which she continues to work closely. She finds that CORAL’s smaller size gives her more of an opportunity to build trust with local communities. Her effectiveness is grounded in her sense of urgency. “We are borrowing time. The need to manage our resources more effectively is escalating,” says Nan. “The only way to do that is for the locals to be the main actors in initiating, developing, implementing, and maintaining conservation systems. To be able to facilitate and empower them to do so is very satisfying.”"

With representatives from 11 countries in the Pacific and over 60 participants and observers, significant progress was made toward ensuring these newly listed species–oceanic whitetip, scalloped hammerhead, great hammerhead, smooth hammerhead, the porbeagle shark, and two species of manta rays–achieve the protection they desperately need. The workshop kicked off in traditional Fijian fashion with an opening welcome from Mr. Samuela Namosimaluaa, Permanent Secretary for Local Government, Urban Development, Housing and Environment, as well as with a video message from the CITES Secretary General Mr. John Scanlon. The panel included Imogen Zethoven, Director of Global Shark Conservation for The Pew Charitable Trusts acting as Chair of the meeting; Mr. Aisake Batibasaga, Principal Fisheries Officer for Fiji; Colin Simfendorfer Director of the IUCN Shark Specialist Group; Shaneen Coulson, CITES Scientific Authority of Australia; and Hugh Robertson, CITES Scientific Authority of New Zealand. Speakers also included Stan Shea—an expert in the shark fin trade in Hong Kong, Ian Freeman from the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), and Lindsay Chapman from Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). All of these speakers assisted in familiarizing participants with the context of these new listings and on the details of how to ensure they are implemented properly. But one presentation stole the show (and the fresh air from the room). Dr. Demian Chapman, aka the ‘”fin Doctor,” as he was aptly nicknamed after his demonstration, ensured that all attendees were familiar with how to identify the fins of these species. His hands-on approach involved displaying dried fins on all of the tables around the room, providing a very fragrant and visual reference. Overall, the two-day workshop was filled with thoughtful questions and productive strategic planning. But most importantly, this meeting gave all of the CITES parties in the region the opportunity to convene and discuss what needs to be done regionally in order for the new listings to be effective. Some key conclusions that spanned the region were: These conclusions will ideally translate into action on the ground, including a plan to address gaps in data, as well as a strategy for enforcement to be put in place prior to the September 14, 2014 implementation date. CORAL looks forward to working with our partners in Fiji to ensure that the government is equipped and prepared to make the most of these landmark listings—which have the potential to significantly reduce shark mortality not only in the Pacific but around the world."

Close to 800 elkhorn corals ( ), listed as critically endangered on the IUCN’s Red List and threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, live in the Bay while the Capiro Banks reef has almost four times more live coral cover than most reefs in the region. When the area was first surveyed and described in 2011, the partnership also measured an uncommonly high density of the long-spined sea urchin, which has seriously declined throughout the Caribbean, on the reef. The designation came about through extensive collaboration and partnerships, work that was generously supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Oak Foundation. “The Mayor of Tela has shown a tremendous amount of leadership in this effort, supported by CORAL and the other groups on the ground,” said Jason Babbie, who works on environment programs at Bloomberg Philanthropies. “I am impressed by how quickly this designation came together for this ecologically important site.”  ###"

At age 13, Dylan founded his own nonprofit called ReefQuest to foster marine stewardship through citizen science. But the idea for ReefQuest—and his first “initiative,” as he puts it—began when he was only seven. Visiting Kahekili Beach Park in Maui with his family, he saw tourists stepping on coral reefs and then complaining that the coral was hurting their feet. Dylan began walking up and down the beach, doing regular “beach patrols,” explaining to his fellow beachgoers that the reef was alive—and that in fact, it was people who were hurting the reef by stepping on it. Their reactions, he says, were varied, but most were appreciative and inspired by a kid wanting to save reefs for future generations. “I made an emotional connection with them,” he says. CORAL awarded ReefQuest its first mini-grant, and has worked with Dylan since 2010. In March, CORAL Field Manager Liz Foote dived the reef with Dylan in Kahekili to take a series of overlapping underwater images, which will be “stitched together” as part of ReefQuest’s “virtual reef.” The virtual reef project is a way for people who can’t—or don’t want to—get wet by taking a “virtual dive” to experience the reef. But it’s also a way to monitor the health of a reef over time, says Dylan. He will be returning to the reef every other year to study it. Dylan plans to continue his life’s work throughout high school, and beyond. One of the most important things he’s learned so far is that people “assume that kids can’t do anything”—but he’s found just the opposite. “I am making a difference—kids really can do something. People say we can’t stop global warming, but there are local threats that are equally as destructive. We can change those things for the better and help these silent ecosystems.”"

The reef continues to be used by the local community and visitors to Kauai for subsistance fishing, gathering of “wana” or sea urchin, cultural practices, snorkeling, surfing, and swimming. But today the reef’s ability to continue to sustainably provide is being challenged. Fish numbers are declining, and a coral disease has recently been documented in the region. To help inform possible solutions, CORAL is teaming up with the Hanalei Watershed Hui (HWH) to gather data on water quality that might yield clues as to the causes of these symptoms. “Despite the importance of the area, very little has been done to examine the water quality of Makua,”says Makaala Kaaumoana, Executive Director of HWH. She and her team will be working with CORAL and local volunteers over the next year to conduct periodic sampling and to analyze data from several sites along the Makua coastline. “The data will be collected by trained area residents, analyzed, and shared with the community as well as government agencies and scientists, so it really is a grassroots, community-led endeavor,” says Makaala. Says CORAL’s Hawai‘i Field Manager Wes Crile (profiled  ), “Once we know what the causes of the declines are, we’ll know where to direct our efforts.” He adds that the Hanalei Watershed Hui is a perfect match and a strong partner for CORAL. “Both CORAL and HWH have at their core the principle of working with communities to solve these complex problems, and HWH has very close ties with the local people.” The reef at Makua has provided for people for so long it is only fitting that people now do something to help the reef, says Wes.

Since joining CORAL as a Hawai‘i field manager in January, he has been busy getting to know his new watershed in Maui. Because Maui is an island, he says, some of its water quality problems are more obvious than in a watershed like Chesapeake Bay, where he worked previously. “On Maui, a simple trip to the store can easily take me through 10 to 15 separate watersheds. You can really see the direct impacts (both positive and negative) that our actions on the land are having on the sea and the reefs.” In addition to restoring streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Wes has worked with communities in northern Nicaragua to protect endangered sea turtles and build sustainable tourism partnerships, with small-scale farmers in West Africa and Haiti, and fishing communities in Latin America and the Caribbean, among others. He is building on those experiences at CORAL. “Whether I’m engaging with farmers, neighborhood associations, or marine tourism providers, I’m getting a chance to work across all of my skills,” he says. A certified dive master and licensed Coast Guard caption, Wes is getting his feet (and body) wet in Ridge to Reef activities, engaging with a variety of groups throughout the watershed. He’s working with fellow Field Manager Liz Foote to set up a floating workshop for decision makers (scheduled for this summer) and helping conduct snorkel tours for local government officials and other stakeholders to show them firsthand the difference between healthy and unhealthy reefs. His favorite part of the job—as it was in his previous work—is collaborating to find solutions to problems. “A scientist tells me we need to reduce polluted runoff, but what I get excited about is how to do that,” he says. “I like finding creative solutions to issues and working with business owners, community members, and others to find solutions that make sense for both the environment and the needs of people. I like explaining sustainability to a general manager at a hotel or resort and really seeing him or her get it.” Although as an avid diver he loves coral reefs, Wes says he’s motivated more by water—where it goes and how clean it is. “It’s what ties the whole community together. It falls on a mountain, flows through different land uses, like agriculture, forests, people’s backyards: As it exits into the ocean, does it leave in a better or worse state? Can we get it to leave in a better state? So many coral reef issues start farther upstream.” He says some solutions to addressing polluted runoff and poor water quality downstream are very simple. “Solutions don’t have to be complicated and expensive or high tech. They can be implemented on a small scale but make a big difference. The rain gardens and other low-impact development options we and our partners at the Ridge to Reef Initiative are working to educate people about are one example.” Read more about Wes  ."

        "content": "On a beautiful and uncharacteristically calm afternoon in February, Maui County’s Mayor, Alan Arakawa, arrived at Kahekili Beach Park, barefoot and carrying a mask and fins in a bucket. Mayor Arakawa was eager to get in the water to dive with CORAL and our partners from the   and the   (“DAR”) to check out the reef. We had invited the Mayor and Rob Parsons, Executive Assistant for Environmental Concerns, to join us to visit priority watershed conservation sites in West Maui—primarily the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (“KHFMA”), designated by the US Coral Reef Task Force as a top priority. We wanted to see the reef firsthand and talk about solutions to the many interconnected threats facing our reefs. As it turns out, our mayor is an avid waterman. He told us that he has dived reefs all over Maui throughout his life, but hadn’t been out diving in over a year and a half. We were thrilled to provide him with the opportunity to get in the water again. But first we wanted to give him a brief overview of our collaborative efforts. I described CORAL’s work with resorts to promote reef stewardship and improve water quality, and the purpose of these snorkel tours (we’ll have more soon—stay tuned!), and our collaborative efforts with DAR, the Ridge to Reef Initiative, and the   program, which we co-coordinate with DAR. Tova Callender from the Ridge to Reef Initiative described the Initiative’s efforts to reduce land-based pollution by installing rain gardens and curb-inlet baskets, which capture and help filter urban pollutants and debris that find their way into storm drains, and ultimately the ocean. The mayor helped troubleshoot some issues with the curb-inlet baskets. We were encouraged by his eagerness to offer expertise and solutions, and his advocacy for ahupua‘a-based (watershed-based) management and conservation strategies. Darla White, from DAR, discussed fisheries management strategies in West Maui, particularly the establishment and importance of the KHFMA. She also introduced the concept of reef resilience, then gave an overview of what to expect on the snorkel tour. And last but not least, our volunteer team from Ka’anapali Makai Watch talked about their experiences and observations within the KHFMA and their ongoing efforts to help get the word out to residents and visitors about this special place. In the water, both the mayor and Rob displayed impressive skills as freedivers, and we were able to look closely at the “points of interest” Darla had discussed  earlier. She pointed to things underwater and then we all surfaced to hear her describe them in more detail. She showed us several “dead zones,” where once-thriving finger coral is now a collection of low-lying brown rubble; we also made our way to the “bone yard,” where we could still see the three-dimensional structure of coral that had died recently—a haunting and sad reminder of the reef that once thrived there.   We also visited and swam through submarine seeps in shallow water just offshore that were visibly emitting fresh water (which researchers have determined consists primarily of treated wastewater effluent) as well as gas bubbles (determined to be nitrogen gas). While much of the tour highlighted stressed and degraded coral–and the reasons for that condition–we also saw relatively healthy coral colonies, a honu (green sea turtle), and positive signs of potential recovery, including some adult   and a grazing school of about 100 surgeonfishes. After the reef tour, we convened back at the pavilion to enjoy some refreshments, at which time the mayor and Rob took the   to share their commitment to take action to reduce land-based pollution on an individual basis; we posted their pledges   immediately. To wrap up the day, we headed over to check out the demonstration rain garden at Wahikuli Wayside Park only to find that our newly installed interpretive sign had been vandalized with graffiti. Mayor Arakawa grabbed a towel from his vehicle and cleaned the sign off, while Tova discussed rain gardens as a “BMP” (Best Management Practice) for reducing land-based pollution. Rain gardens use native plants to filter stormwater on its path to the ocean. The trip was a great experience and opportunity for our team, and we appreciate the support of all the people who made it happen. We especially thank the mayor for taking so much time out of his busy schedule to join us. Snorkel gear for the trip was provided by  , and the   helped provide refreshments for the event from CJ’s Deli & Diner—delicious! Mahalo to these local businesses for their support!"

        "content": "Scientific research has great potential to inform conservation efforts. All too often, however, scientific results that could be useful languish on library shelves (or get lost in the cloud) instead. Some researchers make concerted efforts to address real-world questions, but these attempts frequently fail because the researchers do not fully understand what kind of information will be most useful to managers and conservation professionals. If on-the-ground practitioners are consulted, it’s usually at the end of a project when they are asked how they will use a new tool or newly revealed information, at which point the opportunity to guide development of the new tool or the type of information collected has long passed. The Reefs Tomorrow Initiative  (RTI) has taken a different approach to ensure that our research results address the most pressing needs of managers and conservation professionals. Parallel to our scientific pursuits, one of RTI’s core goals is to provide practical information managers and conservation practitioners can use to inform real-world management decisions. In the first year of the program, RTI’s conservation team—lead by Dr. Eleanor Sterling from the Center for Biodiversity & Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History—compiled information on how reef managers perceive threats to and changes on their reefs, as well as what kinds of management opportunities they have. The team collected data through an on-line survey and interviews with over 80 conservation practitioners from around the world. The majority of respondents reported frequent threats at local levels (like overfishing) and global scales (such as bleaching from warming waters), and little recovery. They reported some activities being addressed by local management efforts (fishing, land-use practices), while others at provincial or national levels (coastal development, tourism). While the data from these surveys and interviews is still being analyzed, the early results have been shared with RTI’s science team and will be used to guide our research efforts. By better understanding what kinds of information, and in what form, are most helpful to managers in making decisions, we are able to maximize the chance that our research results will be useful and useable. To further these efforts, we recently identified a cadre of managers from the Pacific who will be working closely with RTI over the coming year. Hailing from Palau, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji, these on-the-ground practitioners have attended workshops and joined in meetings with RTI’s scientists. In their role as conservation advisors, they will help us focus on the research that will be most applicable to the challenges they face. By taking a different approach to making science relevant, RTI is making sure that our science leads to real conservation gains.  "

Since most of our project sites are located on islands, we thought we’d celebrate this holiday with a deeper dive into what makes life on these places so interesting. Isolated from their mainland counterparts, island plants and animals evolve independently. Since no genetic mixing occurs with populations in other places, new species unique to the island form over time. This high rate of speciation, or creation of new species, makes islands important drivers of biodiversity. Islands have higher concentrations of endemic species (animals and plants found nowhere else) than continents, and the proportion of endemics increases with an island’s degree of isolation, size, and topographical diversity (which leads to different habitats). Why is biodiversity important? Madhavi Colton, CORAL’s program director for the Reefs Tomorrow Initiative, says biodiversity makes ecosystems more stable. She offers the example of coral reefs in the Caribbean, which used to have many different species of herbivorous fishes. “Overfishing reduced the abundance and diversity of herbivorous fishes leaving urchins as the only species keeping algae in check,” she explains. “When a disease wiped out the urchins, there were no more herbivores left to take their place and algae overgrew the reefs.” When there is a dip in the abundance of a key type of animal in a diverse ecosystem, the consequences will be “less dire because there are other species that play similar roles to pick up the slack,” says Madhavi.

He wrote about his experience: “It didn’t take long into our first dive before [we] started smiling—reefs that had been covered in algae five years ago were recovering. The big fish—snappers, groupers, and barracuda, and morays—were still there, but the smaller fish and little critters (shrimp, nudibranches, etc.) were there in much larger numbers than before, and the hard corals showed ample new growth.” After reading about CORAL’s work in Honduras in our 2013 annual report, Don emailed us to say that he was pleasantly surprised by the condition of the reefs on his 2013 visit—and wondered if CORAL had a hand in making those changes. We’re delighted to say yes. CORAL has been involved in Roatan since 2005, strengthening local groups and building alliances, and working from many different angles to solve environmental problems affecting Honduras’s reefs. This work has included helping the Roatan Marine Park improve their patrols, increase their technical capabilities, and build their financial stability.  CORAL also partners with the Healthy Reefs Initiative to monitor the reefs all around the north coast and Bay Islands. Says Honduras Field Manager Jenny Myton, “The areas where Don was diving have been monitored since 2006 and we have been able to document their improvement. The patrols have been working! The fish are coming back! This is important as some of these fish, especially the parrotfish, control the macroalgae that grow on the reef.” CORAL is also working with the government and local partners to improve regulation of development and to find solutions to the wastewater problems affecting the reef.

CORAL and our partners are collaborating with national and local governments to help socialize new CITES regulations that regulate trade of some species of mantas and sharks.

Participants—a “who’s who” from within area government, hotel management, and other sectors critical to Hawai‘i’s future—donned their snorkel gear to explore both healthy and stressed reefs at Olowalu and within the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (KHFMA), and learned how businesses, nonprofits, and agencies are coming together to protect these vital ecosystems. Hosted by Trilogy Excursions, and coordinated by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative, and the Division of Aquatic Resources, the half-day charter aimed to educate decision-makers about the values of and threats to reefs, and to engage them in developing ideas for continued and enhanced collaboration. When not underwater, participants learned about reef ecology, cycled through learning stations on some of the more technical aspects of conservation and management, and even checked out a virtual reef—a three-dimensional online reef developed by ReefQuest.org and its 15-year old founder, Dylan Vecchione. “This was an invaluable opportunity for those who make decisions affecting our natural resources every day to join us on and in the water to see what’s happening to our reefs firsthand. Most importantly, the platform provided a chance to explore solutions together in a fun and informal setting and learn from each other’s expertise and experience,” says CORAL’s Hawai‘i Field Manager Liz Foote. Elle Cochran, Maui County Councilmember for West Maui, shares that perspective. Cochran was impressed by the turnout of government representatives and other community leaders with diverse backgrounds, noting “I’ve never seen that happen before—such a wonderful meeting of the minds where we have all gathered together to learn about our reefs and share solutions.” She added, “how many of our decision makers literally get into the ocean to see our reefs with their own eyes? This was an amazing opportunity and I know it makes a difference for me personally to engage in conservation solutions after having this firsthand perspective to see the impacts of our activities, rather than just viewing photos or presentations.” State and federal agencies have identified two watersheds within West Maui as priority areas for reef stewardship. The KHFMA is within one of those watersheds, and represents a new and crucial strategy for protecting reefs: protect the herbivorous fish that feed on potentially harmful algae. These priority areas are being managed through a multi-partner effort—the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative—that incorporates holistic resource management at the watershed level. Opportunities like this tour that can inform, inspire and engage local leaders only strengthen efforts currently underway—and provide much hope for Hawai‘i’s coral reefs.  ###"

        "content": "Coral reefs, the vibrant and diverse underwater ecosystems, are not only breathtakingly beautiful but also vital for the health of our oceans. These magnificent structures teem with life, providing habitats for countless marine species. However, their survival is intrinsically tied to one crucial factor: water quality.  Let’s explore the dynamic connection between water quality and coral reefs, and why preserving pristine conditions is essential for their well-being. Just like terrestrial organisms, corals need oxygen to survive. Adequate oxygen levels in the surrounding water are vital for coral respiration and the metabolic activities of other reef dwellers. Pollution and excessive nutrient enrichment can deplete oxygen levels, leading to hypoxia, a condition that stresses and can even kill corals. Maintaining good water quality ensures the oxygen-rich environment that corals depend on. Coral reefs thrive within specific temperature ranges, but climate change poses a significant threat. Poor water quality exacerbates this issue by contributing to elevated water temperatures. When exposed to stressors like warm water, corals undergo bleaching—a process where they expel their symbiotic algae, leaving them vulnerable. This not only weakens their resilience but also affects the entire reef ecosystem. Preserving water quality aids in mitigating temperature fluctuations and protecting corals from the detrimental effects of bleaching. Coral reefs exist in a delicate balance of nutrients. However, human activities can disrupt this harmony. Excessive nutrient inputs from sources like agricultural runoff and sewage discharge cause eutrophication—a condition where nutrient levels become unnaturally high. This leads to rapid algal growth, smothering corals and hindering their access to sunlight and nutrients. Furthermore, algal overgrowth impedes oxygen exchange, jeopardizing the reef’s health. Maintaining water quality helps preserve the nutrient balance vital to coral reef ecosystems. Sedimentation poses another threat to coral reefs. Poor water quality contributes to increased sediment loads, resulting in the deposition of sediments on reefs. This sedimentation blocks sunlight, suffocates corals, and disrupts their feeding, growth, and reproductive processes. It also hampers the settlement of coral larvae, making it challenging for new corals to establish and thrive. By addressing water quality issues, we can prevent sedimentation and safeguard the future of coral reefs. Chemical pollutants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and oil spills, pose a severe risk to coral reefs. These contaminants enter the water and wreak havoc on corals, inhibiting their growth, reproduction, and overall health. Moreover, they disturb the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem, impacting the diverse array of organisms that rely on the reef for survival. Preserving water quality is essential for reducing pollution and protecting corals from the toxic threats they face. Water quality is an indispensable factor in the preservation and prosperity of coral reefs. By understanding the intricate connection between water quality and reef health, we can take proactive steps to ensure their survival. Mitigating pollution, controlling nutrient runoff, and addressing climate change are all critical actions that can help protect these remarkable ecosystems. Let us work together to preserve the vibrant beauty and ecological significance of coral reefs for generations to come."

        "content": "Here at CORAL, summer travel is in full swing. During recent weeks, our staff from around the world have amplified CORAL’s mission to save coral reefs by taking part in various conservation events. We believe it’s vital to collaborate with organizations and leaders in science and conservation to enhance our work, share knowledge, and ultimately take effective actions to protect the world’s coral reefs.  Check out where we’ve made a splash, with the latest news from our staff: During the week of June 27, senior staff Jenny Myton and Mandy Norman represented CORAL at the  in Lisbon, Portugal. The event was an opportunity for policy leaders to set pledges, as well as for NGOs and conservationists to present and learn from one another.  CORAL stood alongside the  , as members presented on the impact of water pollution and the need for effective sewage management models. Meanwhile, both Myton and Norman engaged with foundations and oversea development agencies to expand upon our work.  “In addition to collaboration opportunities, one of my highlights was hearing from Sylvia Earle. She is an accomplished oceanographer and Ted Prize winner,” says Myton. “We left feeling so inspired by her words and urgent call to action.” Concluding the week, various   to expand upon Marine Protected Areas in order to reduce pollution, loss of biodiversity, overfishing, and other ocean threats. “If these pledges are implemented and maintained, they will help improve conditions for coral reefs and ultimately protect more than a million marine species,” says Myton. Not long after the UN Ocean Conference, Dr. Helen Fox and Dr. Andrea Rivera-Sosa from CORAL’s Global Science Conservation team made their way to Germany for the  . The event was an opportunity for coral reef scientists and marine managers to come together and share new innovations, data, and research.  Fox and Rivera-Sosa presented updates on their research, and also led a workshop along with counterpart Brianna Bambic on the , the world’s first comprehensive map of shallow water coral reefs, and its bleaching monitoring tool. They also met with other coral scientists and conservation leaders, both during formal sessions and outside of the conference. “It was so great to finally connect with other scientists in person again,” says Rivera-Sosa. “I had the chance to get the word out about the  , as well as learn about new research and science.”   Next, we traveled within Hawai‘i for the   Roughly 200 water and wastewater professionals attended and both Jennifer Vander Veur and Erica Perez, Hawai‘i’s senior program managers, gave presentations about our work in Maui and Hawai‘i Island. Vander Veur and Perez demonstrated the repercussions of poor water quality as a result of land-based pollution. Sedimentation and wastewater pollution are negatively impacting  Hawai‘i’s coral reef ecosystems, and CORAL is leading initiatives that tackle the problem. Vander Veur focused on watershed management and detailed ways sediment runoff is impacting our downstream water resources, while Perez led a workshop on  Hawai‘i’s transition away from cesspools, which everyday discharge roughly 53 million gallons of raw sewage into groundwater and nearshore systems across the state.  By attending this technical conference, our field staff gathered valuable insights from industry professionals which can better inform Hawai‘i’s state working groups and ultimately implement effective water and sanitation solutions across the state.  To top off CORAL’s summer travel, Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast in Honduras, was accepted into the prestigious   to represent Honduras in the program “Resilience, Protection and Environmental Conservation.” He recently traveled to multiple cities across the U.S. for this three-week exchange. Joined by professionals across Latin America, San Martin Chicas participated in programs that pertained to U.S. policies and made meaningful connections that will improve and build upon local conservation initiatives in Honduras.  “I am so proud of Julio and how far he’s come as both a professional and representative for CORAL,” says Dr. Antonella Rivera, who named for San Martin Chicas the program. “This was a very competitive program, which our field team in Honduras nominated him for.”  Without a doubt, it’s been an impactful summer. We are thrilled to travel again and have the opportunity to share our message with new audiences, collaborate with like-minded groups, and take meaningful steps toward saving the world’s coral reefs. "

        "content": "Like the birds and the bees, corals also need to reproduce and continue to build upon the colorful reefs that we know and love. But have you ever wondered the coral animal reproduces? After all, it can’t move and it doesn’t have any reproductive organs.  Let’s take a look at exactly how new coral babies come about and important ways we have and will continue to protect them. Something unique about corals is the fact that different species can reproduce in different ways: by spawning, self fertilization, or asexual reproduction.  When the conditions and moon cycle are just right, an incredible phenomenon called   occurs. Over a period of days or weeks, a variety of coral species will simultaneously release their male and female reproductive cells, known as gametes, into the water. The gametes merge together, fertilize, and form coral larvae, which then float with the current for up to several weeks before eventually finding a hard surface to attach to. This form of reproduction allows for genetic diversity and it gives healthy coral babies the chance to repopulate nearby reefs. In addition to spawning events, some species have the ability to produce larvae internally and then release larvae into the water once they are more developed and have a better chance of settling. This general form of reproduction is known as “brooding.” Lastly, some corals are able to reproduce asexually—which is unique for marine invertebrates. Using different strategies, the coral animal is able to either clone itself or reattach to a new hard surface. This form of coral reproduction is useful during storms or adverse weather events, because it allows broken pieces of coral to form new colonies and continue to live and grow. During coral spawning, there is a high probability that the coral baby will not survive. Marine animals, such as whale sharks, often snack on floating coral gametes and larvae. And even when the babies do attach to a hard surface, they may not survive if the ocean conditions are poor. Poor conditions include excessive algae growth, which is often due to overfishing and a lack of herbivorous fish on a reef, or high levels of bacteria in the water from wastewater pollution.  Furthermore, when severe coral bleaching occurs, it impacts a reef’s likelihood of spawning at all. “It takes a lot of energy for corals to reproduce,” says Dr. Andrea Rivera-Sosa, CORAL’s project and outreach manager. “If a coral is not healthy, it likely will not spawn at that time; however, if the coral recovers, research shows it will be able to reproduce again.”  In order to protect both spawning corals and new babies, it is vital that we improve ocean conditions by lowering our carbon footprint and reducing human impacts. That’s why we focus on minimizing marine threats by working with local communities and partners.  Ongoing donations and support have allowed us to expand marine protected areas,  ,  ,  , and more. Additionally, we are able to fund the work of partners on the ground, like  , who regularly conduct research and monitoring during mass spawning events. “The management of our coral reefs is critical to the preservation of our marine ecosystems and livelihoods,” says Damaris Duenas, research coordinator at RMP, who leads spawning monitoring initiatives. “Learning more about their [corals’] lives allows us to better assist them.” Together, with the hand work of local partners and generous support from individuals and organizations worldwide, we are taking actions and advancing research to keep coral reefs healthy and able to successfully reproduce for future generations. "

        "content": "Did you know there’s a fish tank that produces tasty vegetables, can create economic opportunities, and helps protect coral reefs? It’s called an aquaponics system, and it combines aquaculture and hydroponics to raise fish and grow organic fruits and vegetables.  An aquaponics system relies on a symbiotic relationship between fish and plants. Fish waste fertilizes the growing plants and in return, the plants filter and clean the water for the fish.  , and in the last year we’ve created the conditions for both native fish and plants to thrive and investigated new ways this system could support the local community. In Tela Bay, Honduras, Los Micos Lagoon suffers from overfishing, which impacts the health of nearby coral reefs and the quality of fish caught by local fishers. Over the last year, we’ve been testing to see if aquaponics could promote food and income security for these coastal communities, which rely so heavily on fishing. Cultivating aquaponics systems within the community has the potential to reduce fishing pressure in the lagoon and allow marine environments to rest and recuperate. Native fish from the system can also be released into the lagoon, which could help restock dwindling populations.  This year, Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras, has monitored Tela’s first aquaponics system and is researching what it can successfully produce. By 2023, he will start educating the community and working with local fishers who are interested in creating their own aquaponics system.  An aquaponics system has the potential to grow a wide range of plants—like tomatoes, hot peppers, strawberries, leafy greens, among others. But for the best results, San Martin Chicas focuses on growing produce that can survive naturally in the region, without any chemicals. “We don’t use chemicals or pesticides as this could harm the fish, tamper with the water quality, and impact human health,” says San Martin Chicas. “It is safer to focus solely on organic fruits and vegetables.”  Recently, he started growing hot yellow peppers, known locally as “chile cabro.” The pepper can be eaten whole, in salads, or blended into a spicy salsa or hot sauce. San Martin Chicas thinks these new products might sell in local markets—and it is just one of many potential products and ideas that could come from an aquaponics system. Ultimately, we plan to replicate our aquaponics system to create a larger impact across Tela and in other coastal communities in Honduras. By reducing fishing pressure along Mesoamerican Reef, which is the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, we are able to minimize algae growth, increase fish biomass, and keep coral reefs healthy.  Thanks to generous support, CORAL has seen great success in Tela’s first aquaponics system in 2022 and we are looking forward to collaborating with local fishers in the upcoming year to expand the project and amplify its impact. "

We are so grateful for each and every donor who continuously believes in our mission and stands up for the health of our ocean’s most vital ecosystems. Your generous gift will fund our regional programs to reduce threats to coral reefs, support local partners and communities, and advance our cutting-edge science to keep coral reefs healthy and thriving well into the future.    Clean ocean water is essential for thriving coral reefs and people. That’s why your support will scale up our water quality programs in 2023. In Hawai‘i, we are using our learnings from West Maui’s   to expand to Olowalu and Molokai. In these locations, we will explore and implement innovative solutions to reduce pollution in areas with degraded landscapes and restore both the land and sea.  Additionally, we are expanding our work to address wastewater pollution in Belize and other parts of coastal Honduras.   in West End, Honduras, has given us the experience to replicate and repeat this project in new locations. Together, working with partners and local communities, we aim to reduce harmful bacteria levels in marine environments in order to keep coral reefs, ocean animals, and humans healthy. Our conservation programs could not exist without dedicated and determined community members who are prioritizing coral reef conservation this year.  In the Western Caribbean, educational programs   and   teach tour operators to reduce their environmental footprint, implement sustainable tourism practices, and effectively educate tourists about coral reefs and how to protect them. Meanwhile in Hawai‘i, our partner organization   monitors water quality by using community science. The data will be used to identify pollutants in coastal waters, inform other community members, and influence decision-makers to prioritize coral reef conservation.  Your donation empowers communities to protect their coral reef ecosystems and expand upon these programs in 2023.  Our science shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if we curb carbon emissions and reduce local threats to coral reefs. Science also shows that greater genetic variability will help corals adapt to these warming temperatures—which is why it is important to protect a wide network of corals, so those that become more heat tolerant can spread their genes. To amplify our impact, we are partnering with scientists, conservationists, universities, and organizations to communicate our research results and advocate for solutions that harness the power of evolution. Your generosity will allow us to expand our alliances in the science community and contribute to marine spatial planning efforts across the globe.  Coral reefs only thrive when they’re stocked with healthy fish populations, which keep algal growth in check. That’s why we focus on reducing unsustainable fishing practices and supporting income diversification projects, which provide new opportunities for families that depend heavily on fishing.  For example,   combines aquaculture and hydroponics to raise fish and grow vegetables. This has the potential to provide alternative income and food security for families in Honduras, while reducing fishing pressure on the reef.

        "content": "As part of CORAL’s development team, I don’t get many opportunities to go into the field. But last month, I joined Field Programs Director Jason Vasques on a trip to Playa del Carmen, Mexico, for a series of meetings relating to our work with the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI). Now, not only are trips into the field a little rarer for us development folk, but I didn’t join CORAL with much of a conservation or marine biology background. When I joined CORAL in the summer of 2009, my only interaction with a reef was snorkeling in Bermuda when I was seven. Had I not taken this job, I am not sure I would have ever pursued SCUBA certification. Having said that, w  . In the winter of 2011, when my first work trip to our project site in Mexico was approaching, I gave more serious thought to the idea of getting certified. Not wanting to miss out on an opportunity to see firsthand what it is that I spend my days fundraising for, I signed up for a four-day open water certification course with a local Bay Area dive shop. Fast forward three years later, and as I am on the boat heading out to our dive site in Cozumel, I am reminded of a conversation we have had many times back at HQ: the topic of shifting baselines. As a novice diver, it isn’t uncommon for people like me to jump in the water and be amazed by the beauty and tranquility of a coral reef. The marine life and complex structures are breathtaking to see up close. With only a handful of dives under my belt, I am like a child visiting Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory: “this is in-cred-i-ble,” I think to myself. Had I gone diving 30 years ago (an impossibility given my age, but stick with me here) and then gone again today, my reaction might be more despairing and sad. Of course, having worked with CORAL for five years, I know intellectually that these reefs I am seeing are not as healthy as they could or should be—but they are still a wonder to me. Back on the boat, I ask Jason what the coral cover is; his response is a solemn, “Oh, this particular dive site…barely 6-10%.” Without the knowledge I have gained during my tenure at CORAL, I might have gone through that dive thinking , without giving much thought to what a reef   and   represent. This is a shifting baseline at work. My reference point is different to those who explored those Cozumel reefs back in the 80s and 90s. But does that mean I shouldn’t be concerned? Not at all. Is the situation dire? Yes. Is it impossible to beat? Absolutely not. I am inspired by stories of reefs in recovery or report cards that show improvements in reef health. I am inspired by that 6-10% of coral cover fighting for the chance to survive—and thrive. And I am inspired by the dozens of people I have had the privilege to meet who are working tirelessly to leverage tourism to protect our planet’s precious coral reefs. What about you? What are you most inspired by and hopeful for when it comes to the future of reefs?"

At CORAL, we work all over the world to create networks of marine protected areas. But with any marine protected area, successful management is always a struggle. And it’s something we’re working to address. How do you make sure a marine protected area is going to be managed and enforced, and how do you get the local community and stakeholders to buy-in and support the effort? So naturally when I heard about the PRINMM, I couldn’t help but wonder—how is the area going to be managed? How are they going to get the buy-in of key stakeholders? How will they enforce regulations? The new reserve is going to be six times its current size—it will span across 383,000 acres. And it holds some of the most pristine and healthy coral reef ecosystems in the world. Its isolation and remoteness make it a vital area for understanding how healthy coral reefs function and adapt to global changes. Our   has been leading these research efforts on Palmyra Atoll, located within the PRINMM, to help steer conservation efforts on reef systems elsewhere in the world.

The Proclamation states that “the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall not allow or permit any appropriation, injury, destruction, or removal of any feature of this monument except as provided for by this proclamation and shall prohibit commercial fishing within boundaries of the monument.” That being said,   found that although the Proclamation prohibited fishing by U.S. vessels in the area, there are no enforceable regulations to prevent such activities, and that penalties are too low to deter illegal fishing. Further, the study found that the U.S. Coast Guard, NOAA, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife are too underfunded and underequipped to manage the area effectively, and lack the collaboration and cooperation necessary between co-enforcers to be effective. And that was before the expansion. Unfortunately, despite these challenges,   to expand the reserve states that “nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument as specified in Proclamation 8336.” While the expansion of the Marine National Monument is a great step forward in protecting our oceans, I sincerely hope more resources are dedicated to the effort to prevent this area from being only a “paper park.” The work is just beginning, so let’s keep heading in the right direction!"

The day had one goal: to build alliances between a host of organizations that are all working toward the same outcome—a healthy and thriving coastal and marine environment in Honduras. Rather than a formal agenda, each group presented about their work for 10 minutes, and then led a question and answer session that often turned into lively and stimulating conversations where everyone shared their ideas, their frustrations, what works, and what doesn’t. The meeting was purposefully left rather unstructured to allow for relationships to organically form. And it certainly worked. The group has already had a follow-up meeting, and is collaborating to secure a higher level of involvement and support of marine conservation efforts from the Honduran government. This meeting preceded a larger workshop hosted by the  , a CORAL partner in the Mesoamerican region, which brought together over 60 groups from Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.

It was great to see first-hand that word is getting out that coral reefs need our help, thanks to places like the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and encouraging to realize just how many people want to be part of the solution. The evening’s speakers all emphasized the need for collective action to protect our oceans. Michael Bloomberg spoke about increasing the effectiveness of marine resource management, and David Packard Award recipient George Shultz spoke about the urgent need for action given the mounting threats of global climate change. As I looked around at the passionate attendees, I felt a sense of comradery and hope. There are so many of us working to support ocean conservation, including the amazing teams at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and at CORAL. I’m proud to work alongside them—and you—to conserve our ocean resources. Together, we are doing many great things, and are poised to do so much more."

I chose CORAL because I have always been interested in the ocean, especially as a child, and I thought learning about coral reefs would be especially intriguing since I previously didn’t have much knowledge about them. This semester, I’ve been researching CORAL’s microgrant program. I first compiled all of the archived information that existed on the microgrants they’ve handed out and sorted them by location. I then analyzed the data and wrote up a final report showing which categories of microgrants received the most grant money and how that money was used. Since 1995, CORAL has given out 96 microgrants to 17 different countries. The total amount of money given out by CORAL is $589,724.07. The two countries that have received the highest number of microgrants were the United States and Honduras. In the United States, 21 of the 22 microgrants were given to support projects in Hawai‘i (Figure 1). The microgrants were used for four major purposes: education, mooring buoys, equipment, and awareness. Education has been the most popular category, with 38 microgrants totaling $157,772.95.  Mooring buoys were the second largest category for microgrants. Mooring buoys are a necessary tool used to mark boundaries of marine protected areas and to anchor boats so that coral reefs are not destroyed. CORAL gave $140,837.60 to 22 mooring buoys projects, which funded 300 new buoys, along with additional training or maintenance. Sixteen projects were related to purchasing new equipment, including boat engines, monitoring tools, and cameras that help reduce poaching and catch rule breakers. These tools help protect coral reefs by ensuring marine protected areas are effectively managed and regulations are enforced. The total amount CORAL gave to equipment microgrants was $74,454.82. CORAL gave out $43,200.84 to projects that promoted general outreach and awareness, such as advertisements, new signs, and photographic displays. These more general outreach techniques serve to educate a broader public and visitors about the benefits of protecting coral reefs, and build support for ongoing conservation efforts. The remaining microgrants served various purposes, such as setting up new marine protected areas or the general continuation of the conservation of coral reefs. Figure 2 illustrates the percentages of the total money given out by CORAL to each category. I believe that microgrants can be very useful. Smaller groups or organizations might not get the chance to protect coral reefs without additional funding, and microgrants allow CORAL to work and build support for coral conservation efforts in various countries around the world. I learned that microgrants can be applied to many different categories as opposed to focusing on only a few projects, and I think that makes them beneficial as a way to help coral reefs. Since the microgrant applications are initiated by locals, we get additional insight to what is going on directly with coral reefs in countries around the world. CORAL staff plan to add to the information I compiled to learn more about some of the long term impacts these microgrants have had. But it’s not hard to see that many of CORAL’s successes today are built on successful microgrant investments of the past. What do you think of microgrants as a conservation strategy?

He recently quit his job as villa caretaker and fisherman to focus full-time on developing a sustainable dive tourism industry in his hometown of Bondalem in Bali. This will generate support for his community’s marine protected area, as well as provide alternative livelihoods for fishermen to reduce the amount of fishing pressure on the reef. In December, Nyoman and his partners from the community surveillance group he used to work at invited the rest of the Bondalem community to attend a meeting to discuss the potential for tourism in the area. Our Coral Triangle Regional Field Manager Naneng Setiasih was a guest speaker at the meeting, and was able to highlight Nyoman’s prize, recognition which excited the entire community. Nyoman has also been using his prize money to install more fish aggregation devices (FADs), designed to attract more pelagic fish and take the fishing pressure off of nearshore reef fish. This will help compensate the fishermen affected by the no-take zone that was created with the marine protected area. At CORAL’s 20  anniversary gala in September, the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for the Republic of Indonesia announced that the Buleleng Regency (where Bondalem is located) will hold a Dive Bali Buleleng Festival in 2015. Nyoman has started assembling a team to prepare Bondalem for the event, so be on the look-out for more information!"

So for those of us in our headquarters office in Oakland, California, it’s always a treat when we get to travel to our field sites and see the reefs we work so hard to save. I recently had a chance to travel to Hawai‘i with a few others from headquarters and meet with our field team there. Much of our week-long visit was focused around a single question: what do we need to do in the next five years in order to save coral reefs in Hawai‘i? On the surface, it sounds simple enough. We know that coastal pollution is a primary threat to reefs in Hawai‘i. So as long as we can reduce the amount of runoff entering the marine environment, we should be good, right? It’s once we actually started delving in to that answer, and the process and needs started to unravel, that I realized just how complicated the situation actually is. For starters, the pollution that’s entering the marine environment in Hawai‘i is coming in different forms, from different sources. It’s wastewater coming from injection wells and cesspools, stormwater runoff coming from landscapes, and sediment runoff coming from fallow agriculture land and construction sites. Which means there are multiple stakeholder groups with a variety of interests, complex social structures, and embedded organizational and political systems that all need to be involved in protecting coral reefs. So our work isn’t as simple as saying we need to address the primary threat to reefs. Instead, our work is about restoring entire social and natural systems. During our strategic planning meetings, the word  came up a lot. Traditionally, the Hawaiian word refers to a slice of land, ranging from the tops of the mountains down to the sea, that follows the natural boundaries of a watershed. But there’s more to it than just the land and the sea—there are also the communities, the businesses, the politics and the social networks included in that word. In order to really save coral reefs, we have to restore entire   to their healthy and functioning natural states—not just from the environmental side, but also from the social side. So what does that mean? It means we have to overcome the emotions and systems that are preventing us as a society from taking action toward restoring the health of the marine environment and in turn, the health of local communities. And in order to do that, we must be able to demonstrate that protecting coral reefs leads to good things. We must be successful in the work that we’re already doing—working with hotels along the Ka‘anapali coastline of Maui to prepare them for using recycled water and adopting LID (Low Impact Design) practices in their landscapes; working with the stakeholders of the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (KHFMA) to protect herbivore populations from overfishing along the Ka‘anapali coastline; working with the Puakō community on Hawai‘i Island to reduce the amount of wastewater entering the marine environment from individual homes; and of course, building partnerships with other organizations, businesses, and individuals who are also working to protect Hawai‘i’s coral reefs. If we can do all of this, and demonstrate that these projects have real life impacts, we have a better chance of motivating others to adopt practices that will help protect coral reefs, one of the unique natural wonders that make Hawai‘i special, for generations to come. One of the highlights of the trip for me (aside from seeing whales breaching off the coast of Maui!), was talking to Duane Sparkman, the Engineering/Landscaping Manager at The Westin Maui Resort & Spa. He’s a real advocate for the environment, and has changed the Westin’s landscape practices to reduce their impact on the near-shore reef. He uses compost instead of chemicals, is building rain gardens and designing the landscape to catch stormwater, and is preparing the hotel to use recycled water on their landscape. By doing so, he’s creating a more sustainable future for the Westin, and setting up systems that will lead to cost savings in the long run. And the landscape looks prettier—the plants are healthier and the grass is greener. Sparkman is the perfect partner and spokesman for what we are trying to accomplish. His landscape is a critical part of the  —it’s the last line of defense, the property closest to the coral reefs. Having his landscape designed to catch sediment and prevent stormwater runoff is a major factor in restoring the health of the watershed. And he’s demonstrated success—by putting coral reefs at the forefront of his decisions and actions, he’s positively impacting the business and he’s enhancing the guest experience. “I just want to do the right thing for the environment,” says Sparkman. “If this reef dies, what did I do? I didn’t do the right thing. The ocean is the jewel. That’s the thing we’re trying to save. It’s not about me.” While I absolutely love Sparkman’s humility and selfless rationale, I have to disagree with his last sentence. Saving the reef is about him, and it’s about me, and it’s about you. Saving the reef means we protect livelihoods and economies. It means we protect our homes, businesses, and hotels from wave action. It means we have healthy, nutritious food to eat. It means we can find the cure to horrible diseases and have necessary medicines. Saving the reef is about keeping us, and our planet, healthy. We have no choice but to keep saving coral reefs, and I’m so glad we have such tremendous partners and supporters to help us do just that."

The impressive coral reefs at Puakō are among the best developed and most diverse in Hawai‘i, making the site an ideal location for coral reef studies. Numerous scientific studies have been conducted at Puakō, because of the unique characteristics, clear waters, and easy access. UH Hilo, UH Manoa, and top universities across the United States use the Puakō reef as a site to conduct research and train students on coral reef science and conservation. The development of the Puakō Marine Center is timely for coral reef science. Coral reefs are in peril around the world, and Puakō has the potential of becoming the best hands-on living laboratory to promote understanding and conservation of one of Earth’s most precious resources. The site would provide the perfect field station for the study of water quality and coral reef conservation and management. With low impact on the area, the facility would serve to spotlight the traditional Hawaiian relationship with the sea and the growing focus on the connections between human communities and their coastal resources and environments. Located on Hawai’i Island and with the only undergraduate Marine Science degree program in the state, UH Hilo plans to develop the Puakō Marine Center to train undergraduate and graduate students, current and future teachers, and native Hawaiians in marine education and provide a base for coastal research. The center would be one of the few field stations in the world dedicated to ocean research activities in which local students are the primary participants. With the academic support of UH Hilo, whose primary mission is to provide excellent undergraduate liberal arts and professional programs, the marine center would provide a wide range of educational and research activities. The Puakō Marine Center, supported by UH Hilo Marine Science Program, will serve statewide marine education and research training needs and provide support for national and international institutions that desire to conduct research activities in Hawaiian coastal and coral reef environments. The facility will build on successful programs and collaborations, such as the Marine Options Program, the QUEST scientific diving program – QUEST, and Marine Science Summer Course Program. Training future marine leaders and developing collaborations will be our measures of success."

Part of this Kuleana is to prepare the land for development. Through grants from the Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Aquatics, and the Hawaii Tourism Authority they are accomplishing multiple objectives. The purpose of the grant was ungulate and erosion mitigation and native plant propagation. Some of the methods used to achieve this goal include installing ungulate proof fencing, using great care to preserve and protect the historical trail that runs through the land, and building a sediment dam to prevent flood waters from carrying debris into the ocean. To help with the high erosion runoff, rocks were used to disperse the water from the heavy seasonal rains over a larger area and over 2,000 plants were propagated and grown by KCA residents, and planted with the help of volunteers from all over the island, over a 10 week period of time in erosion prone areas. A sediment dam in the large ravine helped to capture more than a foot of sediment from reaching the ocean during the heavy rains in December alone, thus helping to maintain a healthier ocean and marine environment. Additionally, KCA has partnered with Liquid Robotics Inc. who have outfitted a Wave Glider to collect and analyze water samples to monitor the water quality. Samples were collected in four regions between Honokoa and Kaumaki gulches. Kailapa contracted the UH Analytical Lab to analyze the near shore samples at Kawaihae to gather baseline measurements. This monitoring is on-going so that we can compare data and record changes. Part of the success of KCA is the outreach and educational programs it provides to the residents and communities. Through volunteer workdays, workshops are held to teach and learn about proven propagation, out-planting, and watering techniques specific to dryland plants. Using presentations, photos, brochures, maintaining an active website with updated information on past, present, and upcoming projects with relevant current events; utilizing grant opportunities to advance the cultural, historical, and environmental importance of our Islands to educate within our community; as well as sharing knowledge with all Hawaiian Homestead Associations and surrounding areas, we are making strides which are vital to preserving a healthier ecosystem and environment for the Native Hawaiian Ohanas."

        "content": "Severe storms with heavy rains in the week leading up to Christmas led to power outages, downed trees, and flash flooding throughout Maui. In West Maui, ocean waters were cloudy for several days following the storms, and while surf was big, few surfers wanted to venture into the murky waters. Murky ocean conditions are generally caused by an excess of stormwater flowing down from the mountains, and bringing sediment, and other pollutants with it. We recently published an introductory guide to LID systems for hotel and resort property owners and managers to help address this issue—you can find it for download online. Low Impact Design (LID) can help prevent flooding on land and murky conditions in the sea by filtering stormwater before it reaches the ocean. LID refers to landscape designs that slow, filter, and sink stormwater into the ground where it is naturally filtered by plants and soil and can recharge groundwater. Rain gardens are probably the most well-known type of LID system. Instead of flowing down a storm drain or into the ocean, stormwater from roofs or parking lots is channeled into the garden where plants remove pollutants and sink the water safely into the ground. An example of a rain garden can be seen at   complete with an interpretive sign explaining its function in reducing stormwater runoff. For anyone wanting to build their own rain garden in Maui, see this   published by Hui o Koʻolaupoko. Other examples of LID systems found in the CORAL LID guide include: CORAL recently published an introductory guide to LID systems for hotel and resort property owners and managers entitled: Print copies of the LID guide are available by contacting Wes Crile at   or 808 359-3689.  Wes is also available if you would like technical advice or assistance assessing your property’s potential for implementing an LID system.

        "content": "What’s the price tag of coral reefs? Roughly $11 trillion. From food, medicines, recreation, and tourism to coastline protection from erosion, coral reefs benefit an estimated 1 billion people. Zoom in, and more than 330 million people reside in the immediate vicinity of coral reefs, and their livelihoods often rely on healthy reefs and their related resources. But, coral reefs face a multitude of threats, and unsustainable fishing of certain species that help our reefs is one of them.  While unsustainable fishing practices such as fishing during specific months of the year or in certain critical fish spawning threaten the future of reefs, so does fishing herbivorous fish. Herbivorous fish are ones that eat the seaweeds that would otherwise smother corals. These “lawnmowers of the reefs” include parrotfishes (  in Hawaiian), surgeonfishes (like  ,  , and  ), and chubs ( ), among others. Overfishing herbivores exacerbates the challenges that reefs already face, such as pollution. At CORAL, we recognize this critical link between  (wise) fishing and the health of coral reefs. While it may seem backwards, how fishing is done can actually positively impact coral reef health, and fishers can act as stewards of the ocean when fishing sustainably. But, when anyone takes too many fish, they harm not only their target catch populations but also the delicate coral ecosystem.  In short, fewer herbivores means fewer corals and less reefs, so eventually less fish. Overfishing causes a vicious cycle of reef degradation. So, why is unsustainable fishing happening in Hawaii? CORAL interviewed Dr. Mark Hixon, Endowed Professor of Marine Biology at the University of Hawaii, to learn more about the hurdles facing fishers and healthy reefs on O‘ahu.  Whether it’s fishing for sport or for commercial reasons, the challenges faced by fishers in Hawaii are complex and rooted in a history of slim fisheries management within state waters. Despite existing regulations, their ambiguity and lack of dissemination, education, and enforcement has created a chaotic scenario. When asked about the current situation of fisheries, Dr. Hixon explained that “It’s essentially a free-for-all on O‘ahu, which has led to obvious overexploitation – a classic tragedy of the commons.”  This tricky situation remains in part because when attempts are made to introduce proactive fishing regulations, pushback from a vocal minority within the fishing community often ensues. They advocate for self-regulation, perpetuating the status quo of overfishing and reef decline due to a lack of necessary herbivorous fish biomass Indeed, the movement for sustainable fishing is advocated by local respected elders, or  , within the Hawaiian communities, who are expressing their desire for change. There is hope. CORAL partner,   is deeply committed to educating our society regarding this need for replenishing herbivore populations. Founded by Dr. Hixon and other ocean lovers as an educational outreach campaign to encourage understanding and action for sustainable fishing practices in Hawaii,   is more than a small   (club). According to Dr. Hixon, “it’s a growing   (family) of ocean enthusiasts, scientists, watermen and women, and fishermen who care about our Hawaiian Islands, the culture, and the reefs that surround them.” The core belief of   lies in the power of education. Its mission is to help people understand the critical link between healthy herbivorous fish populations and the health and future of coral reefs.  Instead of dictating rules,   aims to empower individuals to become wise, concerned, and sustainable  fishermen and seafood consumers, fostering a sense of responsibility toward the oceans that surround Hawaii. Dr. Hixon explained that “for generations of Hawaiians,   has been the practice of living in balance, of right action, and of acting wisely and with good purpose,” so the organization’s name speaks for itself. When asked about the primary way that fishers can act with both themselves and the ocean in mind, Dr. Hixon responded that it really boils down to “being concerned, wise, sustainable fishers who understand that it’s the herbivorous fish that keep seaweed under control and therefore keep reefs healthy.”  ’ commitment to ocean conservation echoes through various community initiatives. Through compelling television and radio public service announcements,   spokespersons convey the importance of preserving herbivorous fish alive, rather than depleting their populations. These messages are designed to reach a broad audience, directing them to social media platforms where knowledge is shared and amplified. Additionally,   ambassadors like US National Spearfishing Champion Kimi Werner and the organization’s esteemed local ocean scientists like Dr. Randy Kosaki and Dr. Kawika Winter serve as role models for local youth on O‘ahu. Each of the ambassadors and scientific advisors has their own unique journey and connection to the ocean, underscoring the urgency of the cause and demonstrating that every individual can make a difference. ’ message is clear and resonant: the decline of Hawaii’s reefs is partly due to unsustainable fishing practices, but is also a result of multifaceted challenges, including pollution. “Reef decline is due to more than just unsustainable fishing practices. But, if you want to fix the reefs that have been affected by pollution, then let’s cast fishers as the heroes that can save the reef.” By targeting less obvious species than parrotfishes and surgeonfishes that are critical to reef health, fishers can actually allow the reefs to recover while still enjoying their sport. This will pave the way for a healthier marine ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Hawaii’s reefs face a bleak future. Coral bleaching, seaweed infestation, and the loss of diverse marine life are imminent threats. “Hawaii’s coral reefs are predicted to bleach every single year by 2040, and we’re going to end up with a bunch of dead reefs with a bunch of seaweed if we don’t collectively change our ways. And, once a reef is covered in seaweed, there’s no getting it back without abundant herbivores.” Throughout his research and career, Dr. Hixon has witnessed the gradual decline of herbivorous fish populations in various reefs around the world and the impact it has had on the vitality of the reefs they inhabit. He shared that he lost his favorite reef in the Bahamas that he’d studied for 10 years: “the whole thing died before my very eyes; it was just heartbreaking, gut wrenching.” Because he wants his children and grandchildren to benefit from coral reefs, Dr. Hixon and   remain undeterred.   and its mission reminds us that fighting for the preservation of our natural wonders is not just a noble endeavor but an essential one. After all, “the best thing we can ever do is fight the good fight regardless of the probability of success.” We must continue to educate ourselves and others, and always advocate for sustainable fishing. Together, we can be the saviris and guardians of Hawaii’s reefs, ensuring they thrive for generations to come."

Let’s explore the concrete outcomes your contributions will bring in 2024: Clean ocean water is crucial for the flourishing of coral reefs and the well-being of people. That’s why your support will scale-up our   in 2024. In early 2024 we will be sharing the success story of our wastewater pilot project in West End, Roatan with communities across the Western Caribbean.  We are hosting an in-person summit to gather support of funders, development banks, and government stakeholders so that we can scale. We will also be launching an on-line toolkit and guide so that communities have resources to set the stage for large-scale infrastructure improvements. Over the next 6-8 years, while we are building relationships and funding to scale globally, we’ll apply the lessons learned from our successful wastewater pilot project to enhance water quality in 5-7 communities across the   and  . Our ultimate goal is to ensure that 80% of coastal communities with priority coral reefs have wastewater treatment in place, guaranteeing clean waters for both the reefs and the people who rely on them. Coral reefs only thrive when they have healthy fish populations, which keep algal growth in check and provide nutrients for coral growth. That’s why we focus on  In 2024 we will be focused on ensuring that all of the marine protected areas (MPAs) and coastal environments where we currently work are appropriately resourced with real-time fisheries data, effective patrols to minimize illegal activities, funding strategies, and proper management plans.  This is critically important over the next year so that coral reefs bounce back from bleaching events. At the same time, we’ll be working towards bold goals to establish newly protected areas. Our ultimate goal is to create networks of effectively managed marine environments that are critical for healthy fisheries and resilient coastal communities. Our science shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if we curb carbon emissions and reduce local threats to coral reefs. Science also shows that greater genetic variability will help corals adapt to these warming temperatures—which is why it is important to protect a wide network of corals, so those that become more heat tolerant can spread their genes. CORAL is pioneering groundbreaking research with global partners to create a satellite-based tool that can monitor and predict the health and adaptability of coral reefs from space. Success in this endeavor would enable us to offer this innovative tool globally, empowering under-resourced communities with a cost-free resource to streamline their conservation efforts and decision-making processes. To expand our impact, we’re collaborating with scientists, conservationists, universities, and organizations to share our adaptation research findings and advocate for solutions that harness the power of evolution. Your generosity allows us to build stronger partnerships in the scientific community and contribute to 30 x 30 (30% of oceans protected by 2023) initiatives across the globe. In 2024 we will be taking all of the best management practices from our successful watershed restoration project in Maui and expand what we learned to new watersheds and partnerships. We’re collaborating with   to strengthen their efforts, secure funding, and prioritize sediment reduction across the state. Our ultimate objective is to share our insights and best practices more broadly across the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific. This way, we can assist communities and regions on a larger scale, making a substantial impact on the health of our coral reefs. Our ultimate goal long-term vision is to establish diverse, connected, large, and well-managed networks of coral reefs with sustainable fish populations and improved water quality. This means healthier and more resilient oceans for everyone, today and for generations to come."

        "content": "—Recent monitoring data collected from Los Micos Lagoon demonstrated a 483 percent increase in fish biomass after a closed fishing season in 2021, signifying both higher quantities and larger sizes of fish. Likewise, it showed an increase in diversity of species and trophic levels.  Los Micos Lagoon often suffers from overfishing, impacting populations of newborn fish that later swim into the ocean and occupy coral reefs. According to Julio San Martín Chicas, CORAL’s Principal Program Coordinator for the North Coast, if we want healthy coral reefs, we must also protect coastal lagoons. And for Tela Bay, a community deeply dependent on local catch and known for endangered corals, protecting reefs is essential.  To address the issue of overfishing, Tela’s local government started a closed season every year from May through June, a timeframe which prohibits fishing in coastal lagoons. This allows fish to grow and swim to coral reefs, thus repopulating stocks and minimizing the impacts of overfishing.  Overfishing occurs when people catch too many fish and the stocks are not able to replenish quickly enough. Not having enough fish can collapse entire reef ecosystems and impact the coastal communities reliant on them.  While this initiative originally started in 2010, it was unsuccessful until recently. According to San Martín Chicas, it was difficult to enforce the rules without sufficient patrols, financial support, and  .  But this year, better funding and on the ground support allowed Tela’s “closed season” to operate more effectively. In addition to CORAL’s financial and technical backing, PROLANSATE Foundation, National Institute of Forest Conservation and Development, General Directorate of Fisheries and Aquaculture (DIGEPESCA), the naval force and rangers were involved. In particular, DIGEPESCA provides preferential access to local artisanal fishers, instead of outside commercial entities—which has been a key component to empowering the Tela community. “This year was a success compared to other years,” said San Martín Chicas. “Community members have told me there was much more control on the water.”  Over the 54 patrol days in the 2021 closed season, 36 fishing nets, nine cast nets and three harpoons were all confiscated and donated to social aid institutions—likely saving hundreds of fish.  For the Tela community, this is great news. After all, fishing is the primary source of income and food for locals. A successful closed season can help ensure healthy fish stocks for subsequent months.  Sufficient fish populations are also significant for coral reefs. Herbivorous fish graze on seaweed, keeping algal growth in check. When their populations decline, they can’t keep up with the algae. As a result, algae can smother a reef.  Research also shows that fish in Tela are   to fish populations in the Honduran Caribbean, and possibly the entire Mesoamerican reef region. Therefore, repopulating fish in Tela, can also impact coral reefs that are hundreds of miles away.  In the future, San Martín Chicas hopes the closed season will continue its success. He’d also love to utilize this science-based information to help reform policies. As a next step, it would be optimal if the closed season was more closely aligned with the reproductive patterns of commercially important fish.  By leveraging new data and leading meaningful initiatives, we will continue to address overfishing and fight for the protection of coral reefs—both in Tela Bay and around the world. "

        "content": "On September 8, 2021, it was officially announced that a comprehensive map and monitoring system of the world’s shallow water coral reefs, the , was completed. This tremendous effort was led by Arizona State University in collaboration with scientists, universities, private entities, and NGOs across the globe—including the Coral Reef Alliance. The tool is the first of its kind, using advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images to capture valuable information about the world’s coral reefs in depths of up to 15 meters. The Allen Coral Atlas was named in memory of Paul G. Allen, Microsoft co-founder, passionate diver, and philanthropist, who was committed to expanding our understanding of coral reefs and driving policies to protect them. Following his vision, the Atlas will provide marine conservationists and governments access to data about the location and health of coral reefs. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, has been involved with the project since its early days, and sees the value of this new technology and how it can contribute to reef conservation and management. “About three quarters of the world’s reefs have inadequate mapping and monitoring,” says Fox. “So this helps fill that data gap.” This scientific advance comes at a critical time in history—a time where we will determine the fate of the world’s coral reefs. Every year,  , along with   and an increasing number of coral bleaching events. In fact, scientists estimate that half of the world’s reef-building corals have already disappeared—impacting marine ecosystems and coastal communities alike. But this new technology has the potential to help put us on the right track. The maps serve multiple purposes, acting as a resource for marine spatial planning, aid for hurricane recovery, as well as data to analyze pollution and inform proposed policies for fishing regulations. It is also particularly useful when monitoring coral bleaching, a potentially deadly phenomenon that occurs when water temperatures become too warm and corals become stressed. So far, the Allen Coral Atlas is being used in more than 30 countries and for more than 50 conservation projects. It is free, accessible, and comes with online training tools and workshops. In places like Sri Lanka and the Philippines, the Atlas is already being used when establishing marine protected areas. “The right information and reliable updated data is very important in planning and decision making,” says Reynante Ramilo, a Program Coordinator for Community Centered Conservation in the Philippines. “The Atlas maps will enhance our work toward more efficient biophysical assessment of the marine habitats that, together with the community, we jointly aim to protect and manage through the establishment of marine protected areas.” As more conservation initiatives and locations utilize the Atlas, field scientists are continually ground truthing its accuracy. CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager   is a big part of that effort. Rivera-Sosa is working to bring together a collaborative, global network of field scientists who can verify coral bleaching events that satellites are detecting from space. As a technology, the Allen Coral Atlas provides an incredible opportunity for the conservation science community to collaborate together and work toward our shared goal to save coral reefs. At CORAL, we are optimistic that this tool will assist in our efforts to respond to coral bleaching and mitigate direct reef threats, like water pollution and overfishing. “Now that we’ve mapped the world’s shallow coral reefs, we’re moving on to new areas of innovation,” says Dr. Greg Asner, the Director of Allen Coral Atlas. “It’s our goal to support conservation, management, and policy around coral reefs for generations to come.”"

        "content": "That’s right, underwater communities are breaking all the rules and thriving in unexpected conditions. Our field teams are studying these reefs across the globe—from Tela Bay, Honduras to Hilo, Hawaii. Maybe they’re onto something. Could these misbehaving coral reefs be the key to unlocking the secrets of climate adaptation for all coral reefs? We are working alongside the   to study their characteristics because they may provide valuable insights for our conservation efforts. Misbehaving coral reefs are those that are thriving in conditions that would normally be considered unfavorable for coral growth. For example, some coral reefs are growing in areas with high levels of turbidity, where murky water blocks sunlight and reduces photosynthesis. According to Melanie McField, Director of the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative (HRI), “these reefs in Honduras are defying our expectations of what coral can tolerate and where it can thrive. We would expect these reefs to be overgrown with algae and have very low coral cover. But instead, we are seeing one of the highest in the whole Caribbean. They’re not reading the coral reef ecology textbooks!” Climate change is causing rising sea temperatures, increased ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms, all of which are placing stress on coral reefs. However, if we can identify the factors that allow misbehaving coral reefs to thrive, we may be able to use this knowledge to help other reefs adapt to changing conditions. One theory is that misbehaving coral reefs may have   that allow them to tolerate different environmental conditions. For example, some corals may have evolved to tolerate high levels of turbidity by growing thicker tissue or producing more mucus to protect their delicate polyps from sediment particles. All corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, but some may have adapted to higher nutrient levels, and we need to research why. The rate of change in nutrient concentrations is likely very important. Similarly, the increased turbidity in some areas may be providing a protective layer that shields coral from ultraviolet light that can exacerbate coral bleaching in times of high heat stress. Whatever the reason for their success, misbehaving coral reefs offer valuable insights for conservation efforts,” says Jennifer Myton, CORAL’s Conservation Program Director. “By studying these reefs, researchers can identify the factors that allow them to thrive and use this knowledge to develop strategies for protecting other reefs in the face of climate change. For example, if genetic adaptations are the key to misbehaving coral reefs’ success, conservationists could focus on fully protecting reefs with these uniquely adapted corals. Melanie believes that “the opportunity here not only lies in the science to discover why these reefs are misbehaving but also in the conservation work to ensure their protection. We need to get these reefs into  . This will ensure that overfishing is reduced, and we can build resilience. Sometimes unexpected behavior is good.”  CORAL and HRI have a shared vision to increase protections of coral reefs that can be key to long-term preservation and climate adaptation. The work ahead will be community-informed, science-driven—and will hopefully solve the mystery of misbehaving reefs. We will keep you updated on these rebellious reefs as we learn more. We are hopeful that we will identify the factors that allow them to thrive and use this knowledge to develop strategies for protecting other reefs in the face of climate change. With the right conservation efforts, we may be able to help coral reefs continue to provide vital ecosystem services for generations to come."

        "content": "Reef-building corals have faced unprecedented damage over the past century, primarily due to increasing human pressure on coral communities.  One of the most devastating challenges faced by Caribbean corals is the outbreak of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), which was first detected in Florida in 2014. Since then, it has rapidly spread to 26 countries in the wider Caribbean, causing severe impacts on susceptible coral reefs. Our partners, Roatan Marine Park and Bay Islands Conservation Association, have been monitoring the progression of SCTLD in the Bay Islands of Honduras for 2 years. Here are some highlights of the efforts made in collaboration with the Bay Islands Technical Committee to mitigate its effects and raise awareness. In January 2020, monitoring efforts to detect SCTLD commenced on the island of Roatan in Honduras, following its first report in Flowers Bay in September 2020. Utilizing the rover diver methodology (swimming over coral reefs for observation), presence-absence data were collected to track the disease’s progression. Over a period of 13 months, SCTLD spread across the Bay Islands, affecting at least 28 stony coral species.  Roatan and Utila were the most impacted islands, with the disease encircling them rapidly at a rate of approximately 155 m/day. Geographical patterns also emerged, with faster disease progression observed on the windward side of Roatan compared to the leeward side. While we don’t yet know the exact causes of SCTLD,   are believed to play a part in its spread. On the natural side,   seem to be correlated with SCTLD outbreaks. For instance, higher water temperatures and specific surface current conditions might be linked to disease outbreaks. On the human side, activities such as   may unintentionally help propagate SCTLD. Some theories point to ballast water and contaminated dive gear as possible carriers of the disease. High concentrations of dive centers and increased boat traffic in certain areas could exacerbate its spread.  Moreover, factors like   – often consequences of human activities – can further stress corals, increasing the likelihood of SCTLD outbreaks. All of these factors underline the complex nature of SCTLD and the need for continued research to better understand and counter this disease. The rapid spread of SCTLD in the Bay Islands underscores the urgent need for conservation measures. The high dependency of these islands on healthy coral reefs for tourism highlights the importance of addressing the impacts of the disease.  Collaborative efforts between non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government agencies, and local businesses have been crucial in assessing the severity of the disease, mitigating its effects, and raising awareness for coral reef conservation.  Our most effective tools for monitoring and intervention against this devastating disease are local NGOs and our dedicated partners. Their intimate knowledge of the environment and unwavering commitment to its protection are invaluable. By harnessing this collaborative power, there is hope for coral reefs. The rapid spread of stony coral tissue loss disease in the Honduran Bay Islands serves as a  .

Our colleagues, community of supporters, volunteers, and local partners – those that make CORAL’s work possible – and all of their loved ones are at the forefront of our minds. The Lahaina wildfire sadly claimed numerous businesses, the homes of our community partners, and over one hundred lives. First responders and search crews continue to work diligently as hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. This tragedy and its rippling repercussions will likely be felt for an innumerable amount of time for our ʻOhana and for the whole of Lahaina.

        "content": "Currently, population growth in coastal areas has led to an increase in fishing activity in different parts of the world. Naturally, higher populations demand greater economic outputs as the need for food and household income also grows. Coastal communities such as those in Honduras’ Tela Bay are experiencing significantly greater pressures on fishing resources and, in effect, on coral reefs. Our team in Honduras has spent the past few years diligently crafting the design and implementation of innovative and sustainable economic alternatives to fishing in water that are critical coral reef areas. Through this program we are giving families financial independence while reducing overfishing pressures. One of these alternatives is aquaponics with native species, which leverages the power of mariculture.   Mariculture is essentially underwater agriculture – it’s aquaculture. But, what does that actually look like?  While critical marine organisms like oysters, algae and seaweed can be farmed and raised   of the ocean, mariculture is the cultivation of these marine organisms using their natural habitats. By leveraging the power of the ocean, mariculture creates a lifeline for coastal communities and the fragile marine environments they depend on. The aquaponic systems that CORAL is installing in Tela Bay, Honduras, capitalizes on the power of mariculture for the sake of rebounding overfished areas in order to protect coral reefs. The benefits of mariculture are vast and vital. This approach to offset the consequences of overfishing also helps mitigate nutrient pollution, provides essential habitats for marine life, supports fish stocks, reduces local climate change impacts, and generates income for communities—all while preserving the environment. Mariculture offers a sustainable path forward for coastal regions worldwide. In July, CORAL’s own Julio San Martin Chicas – our Program Coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras – participated in a hands-on mariculture course provided by Dr. Lonnie Kaczmarsky at the Institute for Tropical Ecology and Conservation in Bocas del Toro, Panama. This course expanded Julio’s knowledge on the subject matter as well as his approach to strengthening CORAL’s aquaponics initiative. His participation in the course also starts to fill an opportunity gap not only for CORAL and our partners, but also for Honduras, as Julio is the first Honduran to participate in this program. We hope that by attending and implementing the lessons that he learned in Panama in Honduras, Julio will be the first of many Hondurans to implement this approach alongside our community partners. ITEC’s program teaches conservationists and citizen scientists how mariculture has the power to sustainably alleviate pressures that coral reefs face, especially in the ever-changing environmental conditions spurred on by climate change. Julio is all about science in action and science for action. Utilizing mariculture as an approach to saving coral reefs isn’t just about growing our knowledge base; it’s about creating a ripple effect of positive change. By empowering individuals like Julio and organizations like CORAL with the right skills and resources, mariculture sets the stage for transformative progress in coral conservation. CORAL is dedicated to promoting sustainable fisheries as a way to bolster the resilience of coastal communities and coral reefs. Mariculture aligns with this mission, offering a way to promote economic stability for coastal communities in Honduras while also preserving the threatened coral reef ecosystems that support them. Now, thanks to Julio and this course, we are one step closer to our goal of protecting and restoring coral reefs in the North Coast of Honduras and beyond."

To fight back, we are working with local partners to stop the spread and ultimately save our valuable coral reefs.  SCTLD moves quickly and has proven to be lethal to some species of coral. The disease exposes the white skeleton of corals and increases the risk of being covered in macroalgae. It first started off the shores of Florida, and later spread to Mexico and then to Honduras.  But since its early days, we’ve been preparing for the arrival of SCTLD. By monitoring reefs and supporting our partners who have advocated for funds to fight SCTLD, we’ve made a lot of progress. Now, scientists are applying a topical antibiotic around the diseased patches of coral, while also identifying the species that are less affected by SCTLD and focusing on ways to ensure these corals can reproduce.  Your ongoing support has given our partners the resources and ability to prepare and react to this deadly coral disease.

In 2022, we have advanced our watershed restoration project in West Maui, which focuses on decreasing sediment runoff that reaches coral reefs.  West Maui used to have an abundance of pineapple and sugarcane plantations, which are now out-of-use and have left the land degraded. On rainy days, sediment from these landscapes slides down old dirt roads, into streams, and eventually lands in the ocean and settles on coral reefs. When runoff and land-based pollution enter coral reef ecosystems, they can reduce corals’ access to sunlight and promote algae growth. And when there is too much algae, it can take over space from reef-building corals and ultimately, make it difficult for them to stay healthy and survive.  That’s why our dedicated team members and partners in Hawai‘i are restoring the watershed by installing native plants and vegetation to trap sediment and prevent runoff from reaching the ocean. Thanks to generous donations and hardworking volunteers, we have been able to advance the project in 2022 and continue our work to protect coral reefs. Here is what we’ve accomplished so far: "

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Could aquaponics and aquaculture be a sustainable alternative to overfishing? According to Julio San Martin Chicas, our Principal Program Coordinator in Tela Bay, Honduras, the answer is yes: If specific fish can be adequately and competitively farmed using small-scale aquaculture, then we can alleviate fishing pressure on the reef. Aquaculture refers to the practice of cultivating aquatic organisms, usually fish, under controlled conditions. Aquaponics is one step up—it introduces plants, such as leafy greens, into the aquaculture system. The nutrients derived from fish droppings fertilize the plants, allowing one to farm fish and grow food at the same time. San Martin Chicas and Paula Urrutia, one of our community scientists in Tela, are testing the theory that aquaculture could be a more ecologically sustainable alternative to the continuous harvest of wild fish stocks. The team believes aquaculture can also reduce food insecurity and increase fisher income. They setup a test system in early 2020, but then heavy rains hit Honduras and they learned the hard way that an aquaculture system should be covered—the freshwater changed the pH of the water and the fish died. Not long after, COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders began, and the project was put on hold. “After taking a break during COVID, we just started the system up again in January,” says San Martin Chicas. San Martin Chicas and Urrutia are using the project as an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of running a local aquaculture system so they can turn around and teach fishers how to build their own systems at home. “Our goal is to learn the fish lifecycle and how to commercialize it,” says San Martin Chicas. “We’re starting with aquaculture and hoping to grow it into a whole aquaponics system so that people can also grow their own food.” A typical aquaculture system uses tilapia, a native fish of tropical and subtropical Africa and the Middle East. But growing tilapia would be a risky move in Tela. “If tilapia were to escape here, it would become invasive,” says San Martin Chicas. “Instead, we’re using a native fish that is from the tilapia family, called copetona, so that it doesn’t have the potential to threaten the ecosystem.” Tela has been hit hard by overfishing over the years. Tela Bay sits adjacent to a lagoon, which is a popular fish nursery ground. CORAL works with fishers in the area to help relieve fishing pressure. “Tela Bay is an area with lots of fishers and they rely on their fish,” says San Martin Chicas. “Trying to take them off fishing isn’t going to work because that style of work becomes their identity. The goal is to provide them with an income and take some of the pressure off the reef—it’s not going to eliminate fishing, but it can reduce the pressure and make it more sustainable.”"

        "content": "It’s 5:30 a.m. on a Wednesday, and Erica Perez leaves her house in Hilo to start the slow, dark, one-and-a-half hour drive to the South Kohala coast on the other side of Hawai‘i’s Big Island. She arrives at the first site at 7:00 a.m., where she meets long-time community volunteer Keith Neal. They put their masks on, unload the testing equipment and Perez wades her way to knee-deep water to collect their first water quality sample. Neal stays behind to watch the equipment. It’s the first of five sites they will collect samples from that morning, trying to hit all before the sun has a chance to break down bacteria. Once sampling is finished around noon, they part ways and Perez travels south to drop the samples off at two different laboratories before making her way back home to wait for the results. The sampling is part of an island-wide collaborative effort that Perez launched as CORAL’s Program Manager on Hawai‘i Island. The project, called Hawai‘i Wai Ola, brings together eleven different organizations, volunteer community members, and scientists to champion water quality issues on Hawai‘i Island. Right now, the Hawai‘i Department of Health samples and reports on water quality at sites around the island. But their resources are scarce, so sampling is limited and inconsistent. “Our capacity on-island has been hit hard the last five years between hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and now COVID,” explains Perez. “If we want to continue to be informed and have vital information about our water resources while our government is so strained, then we need to support our government in as many ways as we can.” The plan was to launch a volunteer team this summer that would regularly collect water quality samples in Kona, Hilo and South Kohala. Their efforts would bring a more robust and consistent understanding of water quality issues across Hawai‘i Island and reduce some of the pressure on the Hawai‘i Department of Health. But when COVID-19 hit, the volunteer program was put on hold and in-person training was canceled. As case numbers continued to rise on the island, it became near impossible to allow groups of volunteers to gather in a safe manner to sample, let alone to be trained. And beaches were closed, so team members couldn’t access sampling sites. Typically, a sampling team consists of three people. “The sites are really spread out and there is a lot of equipment,” describes Perez. “It’s hard to load and unload on your own, and you can’t just leave thousands of dollars of equipment on a table while you run into the water to collect a sample.” However, Erica and other Hawai‘i Wai Ola members have been forced to occasionally go out on their own, taking advantage of regulatory exemptions to access beaches when possible. That’s because this is a prime time for sampling. There’s a silver-lining to the fact that tourism was restricted in the islands and most beach activities were forbidden: the team had an opportunity to understand what water quality looks like when no one is visiting the beaches. “I can’t stress enough the importance of collecting data when people weren’t using the resources.” says Perez. “There were no tourists. Only a few locals were on the beach, very few people were using sunscreen and getting in the water. It was the perfect opportunity to create a baseline for what minimum-use looks like. Then, when things fully reopen, we can look at that baseline again with more people and more use and compare the two.” Perez is excited for the opportunity to gain a better understanding of how much human use and tourism affects water quality—even if it means continuing to collect samples herself with just one other person to help. It’s an opportunity they wouldn’t have had if 2020 hadn’t brought so many challenges. In the meantime, though, she’s working hard to convert the volunteer training into an online platform so volunteers will be ready and prepared to start sampling when it’s safe."

        "content": "The Hawai‘i County Council on March 3 voted to approve the allocation of $1.8 million to address ocean sewage pollution in Puakō, Hawai‘i. The Puakō coastline is one of 14 priority sites that have been identified in Hawai‘i as areas to be transitioned off of cesspools. Across the state, an estimated 88,000 cesspools release 53 million gallons of raw sewage into the groundwater every day. In waterways and coastal areas, like Puakō, it is sometimes mere hours before that sewage enters the marine environment. The Puakō community is leading the way in this transition to improved wastewater treatment. Since 2014, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) has worked alongside the Puakō community under their Clean Water for Reefs program to address wastewater pollution on the Puakō reef. Along the Puakō coast there are 643 homes that use cesspool, septic systems, and aerobic treatment systems— but due to Hawai‘i Island’s highly porous geology, those systems mean that untreated sewage often leaks directly into the ocean. “In some places, if you flush your toilet in the evening, and you go for a swim in the morning, you’re actually swimming in your own sewage,” says Dr. Steven Colbert of the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo. Untreated sewage contains harmful bacteria, pathogens and nutrients that pose a risk to human health and coral reefs. The increase of nutrients in the ocean can lead to coral disease and cause destructive algal blooms that can kill corals and damage the coral reef ecosystem. In 2019, the Hawai‘i Department of Health allocated $1.5 million to the project, provided the County of Hawai‘i matched those funds by twenty percent. On March 3, Hawai‘i County Council voted to encumber those funds and agreed to the $300,000 match—bringing the project total to $1.8 million. The funds will support the development of a Puakō facilities plan for a wastewater system. “This is a huge win for the Puakō community,” says Erica Perez, Senior Program Manager at the Coral Reef Alliance. “It took a lot of people to make this happen, and we are so incredibly grateful to all of our partners for supporting clean water for communities and coral reefs.”"

She was selected to mentor this course, along with two other scientists, due to her expertise in wastewater monitoring and management with the local community on Hawai’i Island. Perez used her work in Hawai’i to lead panel discussions, as well as answer questions and guide students on an online forum. She shared methods of monitoring near-shore water quality, identifying sewage on coral reefs, and implementing a monitoring plan. Furthermore, she touched on the significance of community-based action and how residents, like the ones she works with on Hawai’i Island, can advocate to save their coral reefs.  Around the world, many coastal communities are fighting for new sanitation measures to save coral reefs. At least 300 students from 32 different countries completed the Wastewater Pollution course, with participants ranging from different backgrounds, ages, and both scientific and nonscientific professions. “I was really excited to see the amount of people who want to monitor,” says Perez. “Word is getting out that you can monitor to create impact and change.”  After completing the course, many students plan to take action. According to the RRN’s survey results, one participant from Brazil is now ready to conduct a baseline assessment and water quality program in Fernando de Noronha, while another participant from Puerto Rico will use social media to educate the local community about wastewater.  “Coral reef populations have become so decimated,” says Perez. “In response, I believe that people want to act…not just sit back and watch.”  For years, Perez and the CORAL team have been fighting to save some of the most ecologically important coral reefs in Puakō, Hawai’i.  Across the main Hawaiian Islands, it’s estimated that roughly 53 million gallons of raw sewage are released into the ocean from cesspools every day.   that bacterial levels on the Puakō coastline are not in compliance with the standards set by the Hawai‘i Department of Health—and that action must be taken.  In response, we’ve partnered with the Puakō community to advocate for a wastewater treatment plant, with many residents understanding the vital impact clean water has on both their health and nearby coral reefs. “I’m thrilled to share my knowledge after years of advocating for clean water in Hawai’i,” says Perez. “By bringing together our resources at CORAL and the educational tools at the RRN, I believe we will reach more people and create a larger impact worldwide.” "

The USS Liberty beached along its rocky shore after being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in 1942. And in 1963 the eruption of Mount Agung pushed the ship into the ocean, making it quickly one of the most well-known wreck dives in the world. It wasn’t long before tourism became the main source of income for the community. Today, Tulamben is known as one of the best dive spots in Bali, and the USS Liberty wreck can see upwards of 100 people per day during the high season. But with tourism comes more people, and more people means more stress on the marine ecosystems. We started working with the Tulamben community in 2013 to help them manage their coral reefs, and the community is starting to mobilize to take action—notably in the area of waste management. As it is in many other places in Bali, waste management is a challenge in Tulamben, especially during the rainy season. Tulamben, located at the base of Mount Agung in the North East of Bali, is one of the driest places on the island. Rain is a luxury there, but when it comes, it washes the volcanic sediment and trash that has accumulated in the dry river beds straight into the ocean, burying the nearshore coral reefs. The village planned and held a community-wide beach cleanup on February 25, 2015, to help remove some of the debris and bring attention to this issue within the broader community. More than 80 people attended the event, including Nyoman Ardika, the head of Tulamben village, and Komang Agus Sukasena, the head of the environmental agency. “We need both healthy coral reefs and clean beaches for tourists to keep coming to Tulamben,” shared Veronika Niken, one of my coworkers here in Indonesia. “We were excited to see such a great turn-out at the event and to see the community really come together to protect their coral reefs.” As a next step, community leaders have begun collaborating with their local government to rehabilitate some of their coral reefs. To further quote Veronica, “We look forward to continuing to support this village. We’re excited to see what the future holds for their reefs and and to keep partnering with them in their important efforts.”      "

The cases highlight some easy ways visitors and locals can protect reefs, and feature a crochet coral reef made out of plarn, or plastic yarn, by The Pennington School. We were thrilled to be able to highlight the Crochet Reef Project and use it to help bring awareness to the struggle coral reefs face around the world. Read more about this project in the article below, written by one of The Pennington School teachers. In 2008, the sixth grade entered into an interdisciplinary unit (IDU) during the fourth quarter. The broad topic was marine biology, but the focus in 2011 was on coral reef ecology. In science, topics included animals and ecology of the reef, reefs as indicators of global change, and ocean pollution. The main connection to humanities was the link to the study of the Wonders of the World, specifically the Great Barrier Reef. In addition, culture surrounding reef areas and community efforts to save the reef were major topics. Math and languages played a smaller role, but there were still facets of this IDU incorporated in these subjects. Each year, the IDU ended with a culminating display for parents and community members. Highlights of this exhibit were projects and student work from the IDU. In addition, the class as a whole took on one major project to showcase at this event. In 2011, the sixth grade created a Crochet Coral Reef. Started in Australia in 2005, the Crochet Coral Reef is a worldwide project which blends art, science, math, and environmental awareness. Our hope was to create the reef entirely out of plastic yarn (plarn), through the collection of plastic bags at school. Students learned to create the plarn, crochet it, and develop structures that mimic the coral and other sea life commonly found in a reef habitat. In doing so, our hope was to draw attention to the consumption of plastic products and the impact they have on our oceans. Our plastic reef has traveled quite a bit since then. In 2011, our efforts earned a place in The Institute For Figuring’s Satellite Reef program. That same year, our reef was on display in our school gallery and then traveled to the Williamson Gallery, Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena, CA. Quite a few crocheted pieces were on display in their Hyperbolic: Reefs, Rubbish, and Reason exhibit. Next stop…the Maui Airport. Tara Jennings (former middle school science teacher) and I were so delighted to learn that our reef would be speaking to another audience, many miles away from New Jersey. We applaud the Coral Reef Alliance’s efforts and we appreciate your interest in our “plarn” creations. “My soul is full of longing \nfor the secret of the sea, \nand the heart of the great ocean \nsends a thrilling pulse through me.” \n― "

        "content": "After writing about West Maui for over five years as CORAL’s grants manager, I finally had the opportunity to visit the island on a recent vacation. I got to see first-hand how West Maui’s hotels and resorts are literally the last line of defense for adjacent coral reefs. Driving the North Loop Coastline Road Hwy 30, you are feet away from the ocean; as you approach Lahaina, resorts grow in size and grandeur, hugging every inch of land to maximize beach access. One of the highlights of driving this road—for the inner CORAL-geek in me—was seeing several of our   signs. Not only was there one at the hotel I was staying at, but I also saw signs at many of the beaches I visited or drove by. CORAL has helped install more than 50 of these signs throughout the Hawaiian Islands, educating snorkelers and beachgoers about the many types of coral and marine life they may encounter and providing tips on how to enjoy the reefs without damaging them. These signs are just one way we are working to engage local stakeholders and visitors alike; more recently, we have expanded our engagement to address water use and land-based sources of pollution. In West Maui, dozens of hotels are partnering with us, keen on learning what role they can play in reducing their use of fresh water and increasing their sustainable business practices. To date, Maui hotel properties have implemented over 30 sustainability projects from energy and water reduction initiatives, to landscaping best management practices, to guest and employee outreach. One outing that really brought the issue of land-based sources of pollution to light for me was a trip to Ho’okipa Beach on the north shore of Maui. The beach is a great place to watch surfers and we had stopped in to marvel at all the talent on demand. From the lookout point, we soon realized there were other creatures vying for our attention: several Hawaiian green sea turtles ( ) were making their way to a quiet corner of the shore to bask, a rare behavior documented only in Hawai‘i  and Australia. As many as 70 turtles have been recorded at one time. The Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund maintains a presence on this beach to ensure that the turtles are not disturbed by excited fans. Descending from the lookout point to get a closer look, it didn’t take long to notice that one of the turtles was covered in tumors. According to  , fibropapillomatosis is a non-malignant tumor-forming disease first discovered in Hawai‘i in 1958. Initially the disease was found only in green turtles, but it is now spreading to other species worldwide. It is the leading cause of death in green turtles. The direct cause/link is uncertain, but   by Duke University, the University of Hawai‘i, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicate that the disease is more prevalent in areas where there is an excess of nitrogen runoff from land. While humans do not seem to be affected by this virus, turtles are the prime victims of this excess pollution; their only source of food is the nitrogen-polluted algae, which ultimately leads to these debilitating tumors and premature death. As CORAL’s grants manager, I have written countless proposals discussing threats to coral reefs; many of these threats degrade reefs over time, dispelling some of the urgency to act now, as the impact isn’t always clear or immediate. Seeing this turtle first-hand highlighted a clear connection between land-based sources of pollution and the health of the marine environment. Our reefs—and our turtles—are literally dying, and if we don’t fix the problem at the source soon, we may have no marine life left to save."

Why protect herbivores? Because they are the reef cleaners. If there is too much algae on a reef, it can smother and kill corals. Herbivores do an excellent job keeping algae in check. The KHFMA stretches from Black Rock to the south end of Honokowai Park. Within these boundaries, rudderfish (nenue), parrotfish (uhu), and surgeonfish such as the convict tang (manini), and sea urchins are protected. Catching or gathering of these species is not permitted. So, is it working, and how do we know if it’s working? Since 2008, before the creation of the KHFMA, this reef has been monitored. With the establishment of the KHFMA we’ve seen an increase in the numbers of herbivorous fish as well as an increase in their overall size. Fish sizes and numbers have also increased in the areas adjacent to the KHFMA, which means more fish for fishermen, and more food for predator fish like ulua which fishermen love to catch! There are also promising signs of improved reef health, though it is still too soon to tell because coral takes many decades to grow. If fish size and numbers increase within the KHFMA they will continue to keep harmful algal blooms from occurring. That’s why more herbivores are mo’ bettah! For more information, visit "

        "content": "How often have we seen it here on Maui? After a heavy rain, parking lots and streets turn into shallow lakes and streams. Your guests have to tip toe through muddy water, or jump over oily puddles to get from their cars to the hotel lobby. What if there was a pavement or concrete that could allow rainwater to pass right through it, sinking safely into the ground, eliminating the need for expensive storm drains or gutters, and keeping polluted runoff from entering the ocean? Thankfully there is—pervious concrete! Pervious concrete is a special mixture of gravel, cement, water, and a little bit of sand. Once it dries it creates a durable pavement that has an open-cell, or pervious, structure, permitting water to trickle through. Pervious concrete can be used in most of the same applications as regular concrete, is ADA compliant, and costs roughly the same amount to install and maintain, though it does require a trained pervious concrete technician. Pervious concrete has been successfully used for: If you have ever visited the USS Arizona Memorial on Oahu, you probably weren’t there to examine the pavement, but the parking lot which sees over one million visitors a year utilizes pervious concrete for its parking stalls. For those wishing to check out an example here on Maui, swing by the new Bank of Hawai’i at 140 Hoohana St in Kahului (across from the Safeway) where pervious concrete was recently installed in the parking lot. While there are a number of pervious options for hardscaped areas like paving blocks, stepping stones, and grass paving cells, pervious pavement could be a good option if you want the look and feel of regular concrete, but with the advantage of stormwater infiltration. Remember, the more you can use pervious options for hardscaped areas within your property, the less polluted stormwater runoff you’ll have to deal with and the less of this pollution will enter the ocean.

It’s not every day that you hear about conservation efforts that have enhanced people’s lives, and it’s such a powerful thing to know that communities can really thrive and benefit from protecting their natural resources. So when I hear about how our work translates into benefits for local communities, it warms me from the inside out. I had one of those moments recently when speaking with Juliane Diamond, one of our program managers. She was in Fiji last month, and attended a stakeholders meeting for the Namena Marine Reserve. The meeting was held by the Kubulau Resource Management Committee (KRMC), a local NGO we’re working with to protect the Reserve. Juliane was there along with about twenty other people—a mix of community members, dive operators, KRMC members, local authority figures, and more. They joined together to talk about the year’s progress, and the future of the reserve. When we met to talk about her trip, Juliane reminded me that the Namena Marine Reserve sold over 1,600 dive tags last year—more than ever before. They sold so many that they ran out halfway through the year and had to order more. The dive tags generate much needed revenue for the reserve and not only help fund management efforts, but are also used to directly benefit the neighboring Kubulau community. So these extra funds mean that the local community can install shelters and make repairs at bus stops, so community members don’t have to wait for buses in the rain. The funds are also used to provide scholarships for children of the Kubulau community to go to school. Juliane had a chance to catch up with Sereima Kalouniviti, a scholarship recipient from 2007. She received a scholarship to help her complete her bachelor’s in Applied Science, and is now working for the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. “I felt relieved that there was something there that could help me finish my degree and get to graduate,” said Kalouniviti. “If [the scholarship] hadn’t existed, I don’t know if I would have been able to afford it.” According to Aborosio Dulunaqio, a KRMC member, “Namena is a source of life for Kubulau.” And it really is. Surrounding the tiny island of Namenalala, the approximately 70 square kilometer Namena Marine Reserve was established in 1997, when community members successfully banned commercial fishing within the region. We’ve been working with the community to help them address illegal poaching in the Reserve, and to help enhance the dive tag system and generate more revenue for the Reserve and the community. While the reserve helps preserve such an incredible underwater treasure and popular dive spot, it is also so much more. No one could have said it better than Fiji resident and KRMC member Tevita Uluiburotu: “CORAL and Namena carry the hopes and future generations of Kubulau.” For more information about the Namena Marine Reserve and the Kubulau community, visit  ."

Thanks to advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images, we can detect the conditions of coral reefs in different parts of the world. The Atlas is testing a new   that measures the brightness of coral reefs and categorizes whether bleaching risk is low, moderate, or severe. CORAL’s Program and Outreach Manager, Andrea Rivera-Sosa, is currently collaborating with field scientists in Australia to groundtruth the data collected by the tool. “Many scientists are monitoring right now and sharing information on reef conditions. By matching their findings with the Atlas’s bleaching monitoring system, we can help validate the Atlas’s algorithm,” says Rivera-Sosa. “This will further strengthen the capacity of the bleaching monitoring system to better inform scientists around the world.”  If the Atlas can successfully determine where and when bleaching occurs, it will help scientists better track these events, and help communities advocate for regulations that reduce local stressors in areas impacted by bleaching. Minimizing direct threats, like overfishing and water pollution, while also reducing carbon emissions, will give coral reefs a better chance of surviving and recuperating from these widespread bleaching events, and ultimately adapting to warmer waters. The first global mass bleaching event occurred in 1998, and sadly, these instances have become more and more frequent. Scientists and environment advocates are strongly urging governments, corporations, and individuals to take actions that will help reduce global C02 emissions. As for coral reef experts, we are working to keep reefs healthy enough to survive the warming temperatures.  When ocean waters are too warm, coral reefs get stressed. As a reaction, hard corals expel their small, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in the coral tissue and act as their primary food source. Without zooxanthellae, corals begin to bleach and are at risk of dying if they remain in this state for too long.  We’ve already lost 14 percent of the world’s corals in the last decade and we can’t afford to lose more. After all, coral reefs act as a home to 25 percent of marine species, protect coastlines, boost economies, and feed millions of people. We need to  —to protect the Great Barrier Reef and other key reef networks around the world.   "

        "content": "Forty underwater temperature loggers now sit underwater on coral reefs across the Bay Islands in Honduras. Their purpose? To identify the temperature range that corals can withstand and typically experience within a year.  These ONSET TidBits, as they’re known, measure water temperatures every minute and store the data internally. Every four to five months, a diver heads underwater to download the data provided by the temperature loggers. The data gives our scientists a better idea of the types of temperatures coral reefs experience in the area. But it could also be the key to helping coral reefs adapt to climate change. Most coral reefs have a narrow temperature range in which they can thrive. When waters get too warm, many hard corals will bleach—they’ll expel zooxanthellae, tiny algae that live inside the coral tissue and photosynthesize, providing the coral with an important food source. If ocean temperatures come back down within a few weeks, the zooxanthellae will return and the corals can recover. But if temperatures stay high, the corals can ultimately die.  Across the globe we’re seeing an increase in both the frequency and severity of coral bleaching events as ocean temperatures rise. But there is hope. Some corals have survived warming ocean temperatures—these heat-tolerant corals are the key to spreading heat tolerance to other reefs, which will be crucial as ocean temperatures continue to warm. If we protect corals on “hot reefs,” as well as the cooler reefs where their larvae are settling, we can help coral reefs adapt to future environmental conditions and evolve. And gaining a better understanding of the temperature ranges that coral reefs typically experience will help us get there.  Governments, scientists, communities, and conservationists work diligently around the world to put protections into place for their marine environments. So how can we help them design protected area networks in a way that allows for the spread of heat-tolerant genes?  Our TidBit research hopes to inform this question.  The temperature loggers were placed at 20 sites around the Bay Islands, with two loggers per site, about 200-400 meters apart. Scientists took georeferenced photos of the reef along the transects between the two temperature loggers, so temperature data can be compared to a reef’s composition. Now, we can start to answer questions like “can reefs with more species diversity or greater structural complexity also tolerate more heat?” Scientists hypothesize that by better understanding the relationship between a reef’s structure and a reef’s temperature range, we can create a tool that would allow practitioners around the world to estimate a coral reef’s adaptation potential.  Let’s say there is a strong relationship between reef structure and heat tolerance—for example, reefs that are more structurally complex tend to be more heat tolerant. If that’s the case, then couldn’t tools like the  , that can detect a reef’s structure using satellite imagery, also tell us whether or not a reef is more heat tolerant? And if the Atlas is free and online, then couldn’t governments use it to help determine which reefs they should protect based on which reefs are more likely to spread heat tolerance? We are actively working with our local partners to gather and analyze the Tidbit data that is being collected across Honduras. We’re also looking to expand the TidBit data collection to other locations to see if the relationship between reef structural complexity and temperature in the Mesoamerican Reef region is the same in other locations.  With our partners, we’re investigating whether we can use tools like the Atlas to provide open-access information about a coral reef’s adaptation potential. And if the answer is positive, it could change how marine protected area networks are prioritized and designed for decades to come. "

        "content": "Think back to 2020—hospital visits rose as COVID cases climbed, borders closed, businesses and schools shut down, and people panicked. The world we once knew spun upside down in a matter of days. And like so many, ocean conservation organizations, which depend highly on tourism revenue, suddenly faced unprecedented challenges as they worked to protect some of the planet’s most important ecosystems.  Fast forward two and a half years. The pandemic still lingers, but our local partners are thriving and conservation programs have stayed afloat—a truly remarkable accomplishment for coastal communities that watched their economies crumble overnight. In collaboration with   and thanks to a generous donation, we are so proud to have supported many of these tourism-dependent organizations during the pandemic and are thrilled to celebrate what they’ve accomplished. Two local partners worth highlighting are the   and  , who utilized CORAL and MAR Fund’s financial support in creative ways to keep their programs running, staff on the ground, and marine ecosystems protected. Let’s take a closer look at how these organizations found success during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Illegal fishing is a constant battle in marine protected areas, including the Bay Islands National Marine Park, which is co-managed by the RMP. Without patrol rangers patrolling the waters, vibrant fish populations will diminish and coral reef ecosystems could be impacted.  When COVID hit in 2020 and tourism revenue disappeared, the RMP prioritized their control and surveillance program and acted quickly to allow patrol rangers to stay on the water full-time, with non-patrol staff agreeing to temporarily cut their hours. In addition, the RMP found new sources of revenue to make up for the loss of tourism by ramping up their online presence and focusing on digital marketing and fundraising. It turned out to be a smart move—as the island of Roatan saw a 150% increase in illegal fishing in nearby coral reefs that year. According to Francis Leán, the executive director for the RMP, the team was successfully able to increase the number of patrol boats on the water, in order to keep up with the surge in illegal fishing. “The work of our patrol rangers is vital,” says Leán. “If it wasn’t for them, the coral reef wouldn’t be what it is today.”  Today, five boats continue to monitor the protected area. The patrol rangers, alongside the Honduran navy, have confiscated and recorded a total of 905 illegal fishing items since 2020, ultimately improving the health of Roatan’s coral reef ecosystems. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, TASA focused on developing a business plan to support the effective management of the Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, which boasts 342,000 acres of marine managed space within the Mesoamerican reef in Belize.  MAR Fund helped fund this plan, through the Belize Marine Fund and the MPA Emergency Funds Project that was developed with CORAL. The business plan was created by TASA and Blue Finance and puts emphasis on securing predictable sources of unrestricted funds to manage the reserve. According to Valdemar Andrade, executive director at TASA, oftentimes marine protected areas rely on short-term grants, which do not always secure long-term sustainability of an area’s conservation actions and the teams that drive these programs. By putting more emphasis on generating predictable, unrestricted funds, TASA is gaining financial autonomy to successfully manage the atoll long-term.  TASA’s strategy has allowed their team to focus on developing tourism infrastructure, designing a citizen science program, purchasing equipment to work with the fishing community, and much more. “My vision is to make the reserve a model marine reserve for Belize, where users take an active role in the management and decision-making of the reserve based on information received from stakeholders and science,” says Andrade.   By supporting CORAL, you are also supporting our dedicated partners, local communities, and alliances across the globe. Together, we have found success working directly with organizations like RMP and TASA, helping ensure they have the support necessary to carry out vital conservation programs dedicated to protecting ocean environments. "

It’s why we work with local communities, scientists, and partners to protect Tela Bay and its natural resources. Most recently, we collaborated with local partners to finalize a management plan for Tela Bay’s Wildlife Refuge, a marine protected area that often suffers from the impacts of overfishing. The plan was recently approved by the government and will now act as a new tool to protect Tela’s coral reefs.  Back in 2017, Tela Bay was declared a marine protected area (MPA). But unfortunately, officials didn’t have the guidance or resources to truly preserve the bay effectively. That’s why we helped the Tela Bay Technical Committee, a local group made up of NGOs, governmental organizations, scientists, and community members, develop a management plan for the refuge. “The management plan is a result of the determination and dedication of our local community in Tela, who care deeply about protecting their resources,” says Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras. A fisheries plan, which the committee created to indicate sustainable fishing regulations in the region, was used as a base for developing Tela Bay’s full management plan. In addition to providing guidelines for healthy fisheries, the management plan now offers information on how to manage tourism, respect local customs and values, encourage environmental education, and more.  “Together, our goal is to offer guidance to officials so they are able to enforce regulations, support the livelihoods of communities, and ultimately protect Tela Bay,” says San Martin Chicas. “Establishing a plan will bring us one step closer to saving the region’s coral reefs.” What happens next is crucial. Across the globe, so many MPAs, like the Tela Bay Wildlife Refuge, are only protected  —but they aren’t properly managed in real life due to lack of enforcement, education, funding, or resources. Our work at CORAL is to ensure communities have a feasible plan in place and can effectively manage their MPAs and minimize the human impact.   In 2023, we will work to secure funding in order to implement the actions from Tela Bay’s management plan, which in turn will protect the area’s fisheries and coral reefs. From there, our scientists, partners, and community leaders will observe the bay, measure the effectiveness of new actions, and monitor the health of our beloved coral reef ecosystems. in supporting our on-the-ground staff and local partners in Tela, Honduras. With your help, we can preserve this ecologically important area and continue to support its coastal communities. "

Much of our work is focused on helping communities develop successful management programs so they can create and enforce local regulations that will really benefit their coral reefs. And the first step is often to design a management plan. We’ve known for a long time that for a management plan to be successful, it has to be built around local resources, traditions, and customs. So naturally, our first step in working with a community is always to learn as much as we can about the area and really understand the dynamics and relationships. Next we help them gather and compile information about their environments, cultures, and lifestyles. This is what we’ve been doing in Bali, where communities have created seven marine protected areas on the north shore, all with significant management challenges. In Tulamben and Amed, both small fishing villages in Bali, we’re partnering with Lens of the Community of Indonesia (LMN) through the Photovoices program to help the local residents document their natural environments, cultures, traditions, and lifestyles through photos. When compiled, these photos tell powerful stories about how community members are interacting with nature and help identify issues and challenges that may affect management programs. Through the photos, we will be able to gain a better understanding of what’s happening to Tulamben’s and Amed’s natural resources, and help governments and local NGOs better prioritize conservation initiatives. The program and photos also help foster a sense of ownership over their environment, and often lead to more buy-in and support from local community members. Forty individuals—a nice mix of community members, local governments, and indigenous village representatives—are participating in a training which will run from April to August, 2015. By having such a diverse group of representatives who all play a role in protecting Bali’s natural environment, this program is helping to foster the conversations necessary to build support for conservation.

Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, has been involved with the project since its early days, and sees the value of this new technology and how it can contribute to reef conservation and management. “About three quarters of the world’s reefs have inadequate mapping and monitoring,” says Fox. “So this helps fill that data gap.” This scientific advance comes at a critical time in history—a time where we will determine the fate of the world’s coral reefs. Every year,  , along with   and an increasing number of coral bleaching events. In fact, scientists estimate that half of the world’s reef-building corals have already disappeared—impacting marine ecosystems and coastal communities alike. But this new technology has the potential to help put us on the right track. The maps serve multiple purposes, acting as a resource for marine spatial planning, aid for hurricane recovery, as well as data to analyze pollution and inform proposed policies for fishing regulations. It is also particularly useful when monitoring coral bleaching, a potentially deadly phenomenon that occurs when water temperatures become too warm and corals become stressed. So far, the Allen Coral Atlas is being used in more than 30 countries and for more than 50 conservation projects. It is free, accessible, and comes with online training tools and workshops. In places like Sri Lanka and the Philippines, the Atlas is already being used when establishing marine protected areas. “The right information and reliable updated data is very important in planning and decision making,” says Reynante Ramilo, a Program Coordinator for Community Centered Conservation in the Philippines. “The Atlas maps will enhance our work toward more efficient biophysical assessment of the marine habitats that, together with the community, we jointly aim to protect and manage through the establishment of marine protected areas.” As more conservation initiatives and locations utilize the Atlas, field scientists are continually ground truthing its accuracy. CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager   is a big part of that effort. Rivera-Sosa is working to bring together a collaborative, global network of field scientists who can verify coral bleaching events that satellites are detecting from space. As a technology, the Allen Coral Atlas provides an incredible opportunity for the conservation science community to collaborate together and work toward our shared goal to save coral reefs. At CORAL, we are optimistic that this tool will assist in our efforts to respond to coral bleaching and mitigate direct reef threats, like water pollution and overfishing. “Now that we’ve mapped the world’s shallow coral reefs, we’re moving on to new areas of innovation,” says Dr. Greg Asner, the Director of Allen Coral Atlas. “It’s our goal to support conservation, management, and policy around coral reefs for generations to come.”"

        "content": "From a conservation point of view, we don’t often think of coral reefs going hand in hand with construction and development. But they do—coral reefs attract tourists, and with tourism comes infrastructure. Coral reefs also provide benefits to communities, and people tend to concentrate in areas where they can reap those benefits. Over the years coral reefs along Maui’s West coast have fallen victim to this cycle. As more houses, hotels, roads, and other infrastructure projects are created, more and more rainwater runs off into the ocean, bringing with it nutrients and sediment that are harmful to the reefs. Earlier this summer we partnered with the Sustainable Living Institute of Maui (SLIM) to hold a six-week course for West Maui’s landscapers, landowners, and accommodations industry professionals to address this issue. The course taught them about various low impact design (LID) principles they could implement in landscape and construction projects to help reduce the amount of polluted water running off into the ocean during storms. LID uses the principles of nature to design landscape and development plans that preserve the natural function of a watershed. For example: If we work to restore the watershed to its natural state, we can divert stormwater from entering the ocean and help improve the water quality for coral reefs. Individuals from seven different properties attended and represented more than 100 acres of coastline. One participant came all the way from Lanai in order to learn more and bring LID principles back to his hotel, The Four Seasons, Lanai. In fact, we are proud to report that participants are taking action and each one developed a sustainability project that they are implementing on their property. “Through this course we invested in human resources and knowledge, and that goes really far,” says Wes Crile, CORAL’s Hawaiʻi-based program manager and coordinator of the course. “It’s one thing to build a rain garden for someone, it’s another thing to educate them on how to build it. We’re building a collaborative group of LID advocates who will now spread the word.” Coral reefs are a vital habitat for marine life, supporting nearly a quarter of all marine animals. By protecting them, we’re also protecting one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. But keeping coral reefs healthy isn’t just beneficial for the environment, it’s also beneficial for communities. Coral reefs are an important source of protein for more than one billion people worldwide—and they provide vital livelihoods for families. They also help protect the coastline from large storm waves. Hotels are also finding it’s in their best interest to protect them. In Hawaiʻi alone, reefs bring in more than $10 million in tourism revenue annually. Sustainable practices are no longer a trend, they are here to stay. More and more travelers seek to support businesses that help protect the environment. When hotels invest and take the time to educate their staff they help build a vital skill set and knowledge that gives employees an opportunity to talk about sustainability initiatives to their guests. Take the Kahana Sunset Condominiums—longtime resident and site manager, Jackie Scheibel, attended the course and she is helping to pave the way with a new public walkway that will provide easy beach access. She is actively using her new LID skills and will use big planters to filter stormwater as it comes off the road and place native plants along the hillside to help stabilize sediment. In addition, she will use pervious pavement so water will sink into the ground instead of running into the ocean. Just imagine what would happen if these LID practices were implemented across large coastal properties—we could potentially divert millions of gallons of stormwater from entering West Maui’s marine environment each year. Help CORAL and hotels such as The Four Seasons and Kahana Sunset continue this great work! Show your support and help provide a more secure future for the communities and industries that rely on coral reefs by ensuring reefs have the clear, nutrient-free water they need to survive.  "

That’s how I felt a couple of weeks ago when we partnered with the   to take Alan Arakawa, the mayor of Maui, on a bike ride along our island’s west coast. A couple of month’s ago, I was talking with CORAL’s Program Manager from Hawaiʻi, Wes Crile, about how much we’d love to build a coastal bike path designed entirely with low impact design (LID) principles. Using LID principles like vegetated swales, pervious pavement, and rain gardens would help prevent runoff and sediment from entering the ocean—a big threat to Hawaiʻi’s coral reefs. Instead, it would filter and sink it deep into the ground, even recharging our aquifer. A bike path is perfect for this as it generally follows a contour line of the land, cutting across the watershed at a specific elevation. The path could act like a barrier for stormwater runoff coming down from above. Not long after this conversation, we started talking with the MBL, who were putting together plans to build a bike path along Maui’s west coast, from Olowalu to Lahaina. This area has some of the best reefs on the island, but right now they are heavily affected by sediment running off from the nearby  , or upslope, region and into the water during heavy rain events. This was a perfect opportunity for a partnership. The CORAL team is now collaborating with MBL to design plans for Hawaiʻi’s first ever LID bike path. In addition, we are working to secure funding and support. On June 29, Mayor Alan Arakawa came on a bike ride to see the area and provided suggestions on how to keep the project moving forward. I’m so excited about this project and am eager to forge ahead when we secure the necessary funds and permits to start construction. Stay tuned for more information about this project, and be sure to plan a trip to Hawaiʻi—you will want to ride along the new bike path once it’s completed!

When snorkelers or divers visit Namena, they proudly wear a round “poker chip” style tag on their gear, which they later take home with them as a treasured token of their time in Fiji. What many people don’t realize, however, is that this dive tag is much more than just a souvenir – it represents a great success story for community-based conservation. Namena is Fiji’s largest “no-take” Marine Protected Area (MPA) and forms part of the traditionally-owned fishing grounds ( ) of the Kubulau community. The dive tag program was born over 15 years ago when the Kubulau community approached CORAL for assistance in developing a sustainable management system that would protect Namena’s fisheries from overexploitation, while providing tangible benefits to the community. In 2003, CORAL helped the community launch a dive tag program, modeled off of a system used in Bonaire Marine Park in the Caribbean. The program uses fees from the purchase of dive tags to fund MPA management and community development, thereby increasing community “buy-in” for conservation and alleviating fishing pressure. CORAL assisted in funding and implementing the first Namena dive tag in 2003. Ever since then, Namena has been holding an annual Dive Tag Photo Competition in which individuals from around the world are invited to submit underwater photos from Namena. The winner of the competition has the unique privilege of having their photo featured on the Namena Dive Tags for the year. This summer, in the fifteenth year of the Photo Competition, photographer Lars Wahlquist won over the judges with his stunning photo of a   nudibranch. Today, both coral reefs and the Kubulau community reap the benefits of the voluntary dive tag program, in what is clearly a win-win for both communities and conservation. More than 1000 tags are purchased annually by visitors and Marine Recreation Providers at the price of FJ$30. The funds collected from the sale of the dive tags are used to conduct maintenance on moorings within the reserve, fund patrols for enforcement, and sustain a scholarship fund for students from Kubulau, which has already benefitted well over 200 students. Namena is now one of the most successful MPAs in Fiji, and its dive tag user fee system is upheld as a model for other community-managed MPAs throughout Fiji and the world. If you ever have the luck of diving in Namena, you can be proud that your dive tag purchase is making a meaningful contribution towards protecting coral reefs and supporting Fijian communities!"

Earlier this month, our team installed two weather stations in the Honokōwai and Wahikuli watersheds. Skye Instruments generously donated a weather station for each of the watersheds we are currently working on restoring in the Ka’anapali area of West Maui. These two weather stations will provide CORAL with information on local weather conditions including temperature, wind speed and direction, rainfall, soil moisture and– best of all – are all powered with solar panels.  The data generated by the weather stations will be remotely transmitted, allowing our Maui program to look at real-time weather conditions at our sites, plan watering schedules for native plants at our restoration sites based on local conditions and determine how these environmental factors are influencing the success of our restoration projects. The data will also help us analyze the amount of rain that triggers sediment to mobilize across the landscape and cause “brown water” occurrences in coastal waters. Brown water advisories are issued by the Department of Health of Hawaiʻi when heavy rains cause flood waters that contain chemical runoff, sediment pollution and waste from overflowing cesspools. Last year alone, there were 167 Brown Water Advisories issued in West Maui. These events are harmful to people and corals, as the pollution from stormwater travels downstream and eventually settles on coral reefs, where it causes coral degradation and death. Armed with the information from the new weather stations and the turbidity monitors installed near the mouth of Wahikuli and Honokōwai streams, CORAL will be able to investigate the correlation between rainfall, sediment accumulation at our restoration sites, stream turbidity and sediment accumulation on coral reefs.  As the native plants we have planted at our restoration sites become established and more erosion control practices are installed, we aim to show that more sediment will be retained on the land. Ultimately, our streams and reefs will be cleaner due to our restoration sites and monitoring programs,  and West Maui will have less brown water events in coastal waters, benefiting both people and coral reefs."

Dr. Colton is succeeding Dr. Michael Webster, who has chosen to leave his role to pursue research at New York University on how life can adapt to climate change. “The Board is very excited about Dr. Colton’s promotion,” stated John Anner, Chair of the CORAL Board of Directors. “We know Madhavi is going to take CORAL to a new level of success with her deep understanding of coral adaptation and conservation. Her expertise in local and global conservation empowers her to translate CORAL’s scientific to save coral reefs across the globe.” Dr. Colton is a conservation scientist whose career is focused on helping the world’s ecosystems cope with the effects of climate change. She has over 20 years of experience in marine conservation and research, and as CORAL’s Program Director, created partnerships with local communities to measurably improve water quality, reduce overfishing and preserve intact coral reef ecosystems around the world. During her tenure as CORAL’s Program Director, Dr. Colton had the honor to support our amazing field teams and their growth.  For example, in 2018, after years of campaigning, the Mesoamerican Region (MAR) team, led by Jenny Myton, was able to convince the Honduran government to approve the creation of a new marine protected area (MPA),  . The refuge protects 86,259 hectares of coral reefs and coastal ocean, and is a welcome addition to a network of MPAs that cover 57% of the region. Our Hawai`i’s programs, led by Jos Hill, have experienced similar successes. Over the past few years, CORAL’s staff and volunteer team have made   in West Maui. So far, the team has planted approximately 8,000 plants that are holding sixty tons of soil a year in place that would otherwise flow downstream and smother coral reefs. Dr. Colton also managed the development of a new science-based conservation strategy called  .

        "content": "COVID-19 has affected all of us in one way or another. Some people have lost loved ones or friends and neighbors to this pandemic. Some of us are now sheltering in place, unable to travel or do many other activities that we recently took for granted. We are all experiencing uncertainty about what the future holds. However you may be affected, we at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), continue to extend our heartfelt thoughts to all of you, our extended CORAL family. CORAL and our community partners have been working to rapidly change our work in response to COVID-related lockdowns. We wanted to take this opportunity to talk about how we are adapting our approach to coral conservation in the face of this pandemic. CORAL is on a mission to save the world’s coral reefs. We do this, in part, by working collaboratively with communities to reduce local stressors to reefs—like   and  . Key to our success are our local partner organizations. Over time, we have helped many local community groups grow into strong organizations that are largely self-sufficient. However, even the strongest organizations are now threatened by the ramification of the pandemic. To illustrate the challenges that our partners face, we are going to take you on a virtual trip to Honduras to see what life is currently like for our partner Roatán Marine Park, and how they are adapting to their new situation with CORAL right by their side. Roatán Marine Park (RMP) is one of the local organizations responsible for managing the Bay Islands National Marine Park, which at 650,000 hectares is Honduras’ largest marine protected area (MPA)  . One of the biggest threats to reefs in Honduras is overfishing—and indeed, overfishing thought to affect more than 55 percent of the world’s coral reefs. When people overharvest fish on a reef, whether for food or the aquarium trade, the entire food web is affected. On healthy reefs, seaweeds (also called macroalgae) are kept at low levels thanks to intense grazing by herbivorous fish, like parrotfish and surgeonfish. When these fish disappear, the delicate balance of the coral reef ecosystem is disrupted, and macroalgae can grow unchecked, smothering reefs and making it harder for corals to reproduce and for their larvae to settle. RMP is reducing overfishing by establishing sustainable fisheries policies and practices. These regulations mean little unless they are enforced, and so one of the key roles that RMP plays is conducting regularly law enforcement patrols. RMP is also building awareness among fishers about the detrimental impacts of overfishing to help them make different decisions. CORAL and RMP have been partners since 2005. CORAL’s team in Honduras helped build RMP’s financial and management systems, and have supported key positions at RMP. CORAL also financially supports their patrol operations, which enforce local fishing regulations up to eight hours a day, six days a week. As a result of our partnership, herbivorous and commercial fish biomass in Roatán has increased significantly.  COVID-19 has severely impacted the lives of the people of Honduras. On March 16th, the Honduran government closed its borders and required all of its 9.5 million citizens to remain at home. Tourism, once the principal source of income, has stopped. Organizations like RMP derive most of their revenue voluntary fees paid by scuba divers and products sold to tourists at their eco-stores. As RMP’s Executive Director Francis Lean says, “People who once depended on tourism for their livelihoods are turning to illegal fishing practices, which is creating an enormous pressure on the reef. Rangers are continuing their patrols for now but our ability to keep them up is uncertain.” While the pandemic has thrown a curveball at us, at CORAL we pride ourselves on our resilience and ability to discover innovative ways to support our community partners, like RMP. Our team in Honduras is working with the leaders at RMP to create plans to address this sudden reduction in income. They have come up with unique and creative ways to raise funds and drive traffic to their on-line eco-store. They are also looking at how to reduce expenses. To support them, CORAL is directly providing grants to support staff salaries at RMP and other organizations across the country. Additionally, we are also working with our generous funders to seek flexibility in how the grant monies will be spent so that they can be used to support ongoing operations. As of now, we are making headway with funding RMP’s programs but we have no idea how long borders will be closed nor how long tourists will stay away. “The spirit of collaboration has always been strong here in Honduras between CORAL and its partners. If anything, the coronavirus pandemic has strengthened our bonds and determination. We are banding together to overcome these new challenges. Our hopes are high, our minds are focused and our hearts are committed to getting through this together.” – Jenny Myton, CORAL’s Associate Program Director, Honduras.

        "content": "Deep in the South Pacific, there is a small island called Oneata, which is one of the three hundred and twenty-two islands that make up the Fijian Archipelago. This network of islands encompasses one of the most extensive coral reef systems in the world, and is a critical site for coral reef conservation, with an astounding 42 percent of the world’s coral species. Unfortunately, Fiji’s coral reefs are declining rapidly due to global threats like climate change and local threats like overfishing. The Coral Reef Alliance, or CORAL for short, has worked with communities in Fiji for over fifteen years to promote sustainable management systems for fisheries and corals. CORAL initially began working with the Kubalau community in Bua Province, as they established The Namena Marine Reserve, Fiji’s largest locally managed marine area. The Namena Marine Reserve is a top global dive site, and it also provides tangible benefits to the Kubalau community in the form of increased fish size and number of catches, as well as dive tag fees from tourists. The funds from the dive tag system cover management costs of the reserve, fund community infrastructure projects like bus shelters and have provided scholarships to over two-hundred students to date. The people of Oneata rely heavily on coral reefs to support local fishing grounds, and the community’s food security has been threatened by declining reef health and overfishing. Oneata is far from the main islands of Fiji, so there is little tourism revenue. The supply boat comes every few weeks, and while locals do grow their own cassava and vegetables they have to travel great distances to access other food markets. Fishing, therefore, is a vital source of food and income. The Oneata community reached out to CORAL and asked for help with their locally managed marine area, citing the success of the Namena Marine Reserve. Right now, CORAL is actively working with Oneata to strategize around the creation and implementation of sustainable fishing solutions that will ensure food security and decrease fishing pressure on coral reefs."

And the fishes that we see before, won’t be able to see that much nowadays.” Food security is especially concerning in Oneata, where the distance from the main Fijian islands limits access to food markets. Traditionally-owned fishing areas called iqoliqoli have been used for generations, but overfishing has dramatically decreased catch sizes and catch amounts. On a recent field visit to Oneata, the community requested the help of the Coral Reef Alliance to address overfishing concerns. Soko Ledua, the head of the local fishing group, is one of the community members who worries about the future of fishing in Oneata. For decades, fishermen have sought out the highly-prized sea cucumber, which can have a market value upwards of 50 US dollars each. But like the reefs, populations of sea cucumbers are declining. “Before, just in front here, we just catching (sea cucumbers) here, twenty, forty pieces per day. But here, let’s see, yesterday here we are catching only seven. If we keep on harvesting this one, maybe ten years left…” Last year, CORAL held a planning session and workshop with communities in Oneata to help identify challenges and successes with the current management efforts of their iqoliqoli. That meeting inspired a number of solutions that are specifically tailored to Oneata’s needs. For example, CORAL is working with the Ministry of Fisheries in Fiji to train the local fishing group and community on best practices for sustainable fishing. Fishermen will learn how to measure the appropriate catch size for different fish species, and will train to become fish wardens of the iqoliqoli, to better protect it from outside fishing pressure. CORAL is also establishing partnerships in Oneata to create aquaculture systems in exchange for strong community commitment to avoid overfishing in the marine reserve. One such system is a mollusk and lobster aquaculture pilot program, which will provide a source of food and livelihood for the community while the iqoliqoli recovers. This is the first time that CORAL is tackling aquaculture, and what we love most about this collaboration with Oneata is that the ideas were generated by members of the community. This project will be an important model for how to finance conservation on remote coral reefs that don’t have access to revenue from tourism, and will be scalable to other remote areas of Fiji.

        "content": "In early March, 2018, communities in Amed and Tulamben held coastal cleanups to show their support for the third International Year of the Reef (IYOR). Local communities, Reef Check Foundation Indonesia (RCFI), and the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) encouraged youth participation as part of the event. The cleanups helped stakeholders share information about the impacts of marine debris on marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs, which support numerous living organisms. In these communities, coral reefs are the foundation of the local economy. On Sunday, March 4, 2018, Rare Tulamben, a youth group in Tulamben village, conducted a coastal cleanup in their neighborhood and along a stretch of beach. In the past, Rare Tulamben held coastal cleanups every Sunday morning, but the volcanic activity of Mount Agung, which led to community evacuations late last year, reduced the frequency and consistency of these cleanups. The community plans to continue these weekly activities as soon as Mount Agung’s volcanic activity decreases. Rare Tulamben is supported by TPST-Tulamben, a local trash management agency. I Nyoman Suastika, one of the local leaders working with Rare Tulamben, said that the involvement of youth in this kind of activity helps build their awareness of the environment at an early age. Suastika added, “Children usually do cleanups around this area. By doing this, we hope these activities will not only be useful for the children, but also the surrounding community in the future.” Participants of the Tulamben cleanup collected 110 kg (242 lbs.) of garbage, which was dominated by plastic. In addition, participants found Styrofoam, cigarette butts and fishing gear.  I Gusti Ayu Lakshmi from the RCFI explained that the cleanup was part of the preliminary data collection that can inform future trash management awareness campaigns. Lakshmi shared that she hopes more parties will participate in the future to help encourage waste management at the local level. The Amed coastal cleanup took place on March 3, 2018 and concentrated on Jemeluk Beach. Participants included youth, representatives of the fishermen community Tunas Mekar, photography community Klik Amed, the waste management non-profit Yayasan Peduli Alam, dive operators and members from adjacent communities. Participants walked approximately six hundred meters on Jemeluk Beach and collected a total of 120 kg (264 lbs.) of garbage. Most of the waste collected during the Amed coastal cleanup was plastic. Common forms included shopping bags, food wrappers, bottles and straws. Styrofoam comprised the second most common type of trash, followed by fishing gear, which included pieces of nets, fishing line and rope. I Nengah Polos, a representative of the Klik Amed community, said that “garbage on the beach is usually more common in the rainy season because additional trash is brought by both ocean currents and water flowing from the higher ground. Therefore, this kind of activity should be routinely implemented in addition to reducing sources of waste.”"

        "content": "Since 2014, the CORAL Conservation Prize has been awarded annually to an individual who has proven to be an outstanding leader in the conservation of coral reefs. The CORAL Prize is a unique opportunity to recognize the people that are truly making a difference in the future of coral reefs, and applicants are nominated by a member of their community for their achievements and dedication. This year, we are honored to present Komeno Roberto Jean Luc (Roberto) as our 2018 CORAL Conservation Prize winner. Roberto grew up in Atsimo Andrefana, (Southwest) Madagascar, an area struck by immense poverty but surrounded by some of the most beautiful and diverse coral reefs. Roberto’s dedication to coral reefs and his community has been proven time and time again through his work as Head Scientific Advisor at Reef Doctor, a UK-based non-profit conservation and social development organization, and over his 18 years at the Institute of Fisheries and Marine Sciences in Toliara Madagascar. Roberto leads Reef Doctor’s diverse conservation and development projects including; aquaculture, reef restoration, marine reserve management, and research. He is one of only of 4% of the population of Atsimo Andrefana to obtain a university education; he holds a Masters in Applied Oceanography from the University of Toliara and a degree in Natural Sciences from the University of Antananarivo. Roberto has worked on a wide range of conservation efforts including monitoring coral bleaching, managing and developing marine protected areas and protecting and monitoring seagrass. His research yields important science-based information for all partners and has pioneering new techniques and pushed the boundaries of development and coral research in Madagascar. Roberto is both an integral member of the reef conservation community and an outstanding leader in his community. Atsimo Andrefana is a rural area where over 70% of the population has received less than 4 years of education and 88% of the population is identified as living in either severe or acute poverty, according to an Alkire and Santos Multidimensional Poverty Index assessment. Through his work at Reef Doctor, Roberto has worked closely with the local fishing communities to provide the skills and tools to the local community to protect and manage their marine and terrestrial ecosystems and support the livelihood of around 200,000 rural fishers threatened by declining fishery yields and degraded marine habitats. This, in turn, improves the well being of the impoverished rural communities as well as the natural environment and resources they depend upon, which are largely threatened by degradation and over-exploitation. Roberto’s commitment to leadership in both coral reef conservation and within his community has helped save coral reefs in Madagascar and serves as an inspiration to all who love and depend on coral reefs."

        "content": "In 2016, CORAL began an exciting new partnership with the Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL) at Stanford University. Three key players met to kickstart this collaboration: Dr. Michael Webster, CORAL’s Executive Director, Dr. Jeremy Bailenson, VHIL’s Director, and Dr. Robert Richmond, Director of the University of Hawaiʻi’s Kewalo Marine Laboratory. Although they didn’t know it at the time, their meeting would lead to one of the most popular virtual reality films presented at Tribeca. Their discussion centered around one key question:   The answer became clear when Dr. Richmond, who is also a CORAL Board member, suggested that VHIL staff attend a Palauan congressional meeting to show leaders how their coral reefs looked in virtual reality. This meeting would provide decision-makers and leaders with an immersive opportunity to learn more about coral reefs, their importance, and the threats they face. And then, hopefully, to positively influence the trajectory of future laws and regulations affecting coral reefs and coral reef conservation. With CORAL’s help, two VHIL staff members – Tobin Asher and Elise Ogle – traveled to Palau to film underwater virtual reality footage. Asher and Ogle’s visit coincided not only with the congressional meeting but also with a Stanford University Overseas Seminar, taught by Dr. Robert Dunbar and Dr. Stephen Monismith of Stanford University and Dr. Richmond. Asher and Ogle were able to join Stanford students and staff from the Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC) on daily field expeditions and filmed a diverse selection of both healthy and degraded reefs. The congressional meeting took place on July 7, 2017, at PICRC; Palauan delegates and senators attended the event, PICRC staff moderated the event and Dr. Richmond and Dr. Dunbar gave presentations on coral reef conservation and management. The goal of the meeting was to connect decision-makers and scientists and to facilitate understanding of how climate change and local stressors are affecting coral reefs in Palau and the people who depend on them. After the presentations, Asher and Ogle ran personalized demonstrations of virtual underwater footage from Palauan reefs. Many congressional members had never experienced VR technology before, and for some senators, it was their first time seeing an underwater landscape of coral reefs. An especially impactful underwater scene showed a popular snorkeling site, with tourists inadvertently kicking corals on the reef. Experiencing coral reefs in virtual reality and seeing the threats they face helped attendees understand the importance of protecting coral reefs, especially the popular tourist sites. Soon after the experience, Palauan senators introduced initiatives that would reduce the number of people at popular tourist sites and also made commitments to further research to protect coral reefs. The collaboration between the VHIL and CORAL didn’t end after the landmark congressional meeting. Asher and Ogle attended the 2017 CORAL Prize event last September and led individual immersive experiences for attendees. CORAL staff experienced bustling Palauan coral reefs and saw the power of virtual reality for conservation. VHIL staff also used the virtual reality footage from Palau to create  , an underwater VR film that was showcased at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2018. The film was a breakout star at the festival, garnering praise like “the best… virtual reality experience on offer at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival” from Observer Magazine. The film’s upbeat message helped connect viewers to coral reefs, and its interactive nature contributed to its success. As underwater filmmaker Ogle points out, “When you put the headset on and you feel immersed, that’s really what drives this experience as far as creating attitude and behavior changes for coral reefs.” The VHIL team is now working to bring   to popular Virtual Reality platforms, like SteamVR, Oculus and VIVEPORT. The film is available on Oculus  . Asher believes the message of hope was critical to the film’s impactful debut. “One of the things that was important to us was that it wasn’t a doom and gloom story. We wanted to emphasize that there are things people can do to combat what’s happening, and if we take action we can see positive results for coral reefs.”"

        "content": "Over the past few years, there’s been a steady increase and interest in a number of coral conservation activities that fall into the broad category of restoration. These include coral gardening, breeding corals in tanks and transplanting them onto reefs and growing corals on artificial reef structures in the water. At the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), we frequently get asked questions about restoration activities, so we thought we’d take a moment to explain some of the more common techniques, their potential benefits and disadvantages, and how CORAL is approaching restoration. One of the most common approaches to restoration is to place artificial reef structures on the ocean floor on which corals can grow. In some cases—for example, when natural reefs have been bombed for fish or mined for building materials—this approach may be an essential tool for rebuilding reefs. This is the case in several locations in North Bali, Indonesia, where many of the natural reefs are severely degraded. In response, communities are installing a variety of rebar and concrete structures on the seafloor to provide a place for baby corals to settle and grow. Unfortunately, deployment of these materials is haphazard, and sometimes, when they aren’t properly affixed to the seafloor, these structures become dislodged in storms and turn into wrecking balls, damaging natural reefs. At the request of these communities, CORAL is launching a new project that involves in-water testing of three common restoration materials. Our goals are to identify which approaches are best for rebuilding reefs and use this information to improve coral restoration techniques in North Bali and beyond. Another popular restoration technique is to grow corals in aquaria and out-plant them onto natural or artificial reefs. However, there remain a lot of questions about whether this and similar approaches are scalable due to their high implementation costs. If the goal of restoration is to repopulate degraded reefs, it’s likely that lots and lots and lots of corals will need to be out-planted to have a positive impact on the natural ecosystem. For example, we estimate that there are billions individual coral colonies in the Mesoamerican Reef, which spans over 600 miles of coastline from Mexico to Honduras. How many corals would need to be grown and out-planted to impact this ecosystem? Ten thousand or ten million? To answer this and similar questions, we launched a partnership with The Nature Conservancy’s Caribbean program this past summer. Using a mathematical model that we have developed with partners at the University of Washington and Rutgers University, we will estimate how many corals, planted with what frequency and in what locations relative to predominant ocean currents, are going to be required to positively impact coral reefs. We will use results from this model to develop “rules of thumb” for restoration practices that will help the conservation community evaluate the return on investment for restoration activities. A third approach to restoration is to select or genetically engineer corals that have particular traits—such as the ability to thrive in hot water—breed these corals in lab aquaria and out-plant them onto reefs. While this may seem like a good idea (the world is getting warmer, after all!), there is a very real risk that these approaches could compromise a reef’s genetic diversity. The inherent genetic diversity in coral reef ecosystems means that some individual corals thrive in warmer water and some do better in cooler water. Even as the average global temperature gets warmer, there will be variability about that average. If we saturate a reef with only corals that thrive in hot water, what happens if our predictions for a particular site are wrong and it cools? Or what happens if the engineered corals are particularly susceptible to a disease that strikes the reef? Basically, by engineering a solution and artificially selecting corals for unknown future conditions, we are putting all our eggs in one basket with potentially disastrous consequences. In the end, for these and other restoration techniques to be successful, they must also include effective conservation and management to the address the local stressors that led to reef decline in the first place. Without improving water quality, reducing over-fishing and stopping destructive practices, no reefs—natural or artificial, grown in an aquarium or in the ocean—have much chance of surviving. In this way, restoration can be thought of as one tool in a tool belt; let’s just remember you can’t build a house with only a hammer. That’s why at CORAL, we take a holistic approach to conservation that combines community-driven conservation with cutting edge science. We work with communities to reduce local threats to reefs and improve livelihoods, creating win-wins for reefs and people. We choose locations for our efforts that are connected to each other by the movement of baby corals. The resulting networks are places where corals can adapt to climate change through natural processes. We call these networks Adaptive Reefscapes. Simultaneously, we are advancing conservation science by testing and refining approaches to saving coral reefs. Our work on restoration is aimed at improving our understanding of how restoration activities can be most effective; by sharing this information, we can improve restoration globally."

        "content": "Coral reefs have been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons: island construction projects that are burying reefs, El Niño causing coral bleaching, and the risk to corals from carbon pollution. So it was unwelcomed news when we learned in October about a new study,  , that shows a common ingredient in sunscreen, oxybenzone, is bad for corals. Even at very low concentrations, the growth rate of baby corals exposed to oxybenzone slowed down and they became deformed. When the concentration was increased, baby corals bleached, which caused them to release their food-generating  . Scientists are just starting to understand how chemicals like sunscreens can harm corals. The current study is an important step forward, but we expect to learn more about the effects of oxybenzone on corals in the years to come. We will also learn about how a myriad of chemicals are interacting to create a potentially toxic soup for corals. In the meantime, we know enough to take action. Oxybenzone is demonstrably bad for corals and we need to limit its concentration in coastal waters. Corals are as important to the reefs as trees are to the forest: they build the habitat for all of the other life that calls the reef home. But by knowing that this risk exists for corals, we view this as an opportunity to do something small to help: when you’re visiting coral reef areas, don’t lather up with sunscreen, instead cover up for corals. Everyone can take one or more of these simple steps: As an added benefit, covering up just might be good for you, too. In addition to harming corals and other animals, scientists have identified oxybenzone as an endocrine disruptor with estrogenic effects (acting similarly to estrogen in our bodies) by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) ( ) and the International Chemical Secretariat ( ). When covering up is not an option, there may be some sunscreens that are less harmful to corals. In particular, research indicates that nonchemical, mineral-based sunscreens are best (such as top   ranked  ,  , and   sunscreens). Corals face many stressors that put the entire reef ecosystem at risk. Finding solutions for corals is important for the many species that call the reef home. It’s also important to the millions of people around the world who rely on coral reefs to provide food, protect shorelines from damaging storms and sea level rise, and to create economic opportunities through tourism. The good news is that many places are already working to help keep corals healthy by maintaining thriving fish populations and reducing coastal water pollution. If we can reduce harmful sunscreens from the coastal environment, we can give corals a little more breathing room to adapt to a changing world."

Around the world water pollution from land-based sources is killing our reefs—from cesspools and sewage pollution to contaminated runoff and pollutants. —on Hawai‘i Island, the small, but strong community in Puakō is setting out to change the trajectory for its coral reefs and, could set a precedence for community wastewater treatment state-wide. Puakō Reef is one of the most significant reefs in the main Hawaiian Islands. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated the South Kohala region, including Puakō, as a Coral Priority Management Site through its Habitat Blueprint initiative. The Puakō community, alarmed by the changes to their reef, reached out to local scientists and the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) to evaluate the causes and find solutions on how to restore reef health. A key challenge for wastewater treatment in Puakō is the proximity of residential properties to the shoreline, combined with the geology—very porous volcanic rock and high groundwater. This means that any polluted water released from residential treatment units can make its way to the reefs. Studies of this reef reveal that high levels of nutrients, bacteria, chemicals and pathogens enter the ocean from local cesspools. The overabundance of nutrients upsets the delicate balance of corals and causes an increase in algae and a loss of coral cover. On February 1, CORAL and the Puakō community reached a   with the release of a comprehensive   that supports the   project. The report provides a thorough analysis of three potential wastewater treatment solutions for the Puakō community and a formal recommendation on the best option—an onsite treatment facility.

        "category": null,
        "content": "Biologists talk a lot about biodiversity (aka biological diversity). But what does this really mean? Biodiversity refers to the variety of life. When biodiversity is high, it means there are many different types of organisms and species. Coral reefs have very high biodiversity—more than 25 percent of all marine species are found on coral reefs, which occupy less than one percent of the ocean. And every organism plays a unique role and contributes to how coral reef communities survive and function. When scientists lament the loss of biodiversity, they are not only saying that the number of species has changed on a reef or in a region, but that there may also be changes in how that reef functions. Coral reef species exist in a delicate balance of roles and responsibilities. The herbivores graze and keep algae growth in check. The predators keep the populations of herbivores and weak or injured fish in balance. Parrotfish munch on coral and emit the sand that many tiny creatures live in and on. Cleaner shrimp and fish remove parasites to keep many species healthy and thriving. The pink lacquer of crustose coralline algae releases chemicals that signal to larval coral there is a good place to settle. Each species has a role, and when that role is lost or threatened, the impact can cascade across other groups. High biodiversity ensures the health of the reef. It spreads those roles across many species, so if one species is affected by a disease or other threat, that role won’t be lost on the reef. Biodiversity also benefits humans. Many medical advances have come from coral reef species, and there are still an estimated   species yet to be described. We can only imagine what might be discovered next, from new species to new medical advances."

        "content": "In November 2015, I boarded a 9:30 p.m. flight from Los Angeles and eleven hours later awoke to another dawn in another world. It was my fourth visit to Fiji since my first in 1980, and as I stepped off the jet, I was again welcomed by a chorus of island birds drifting my way on a warm tropical breeze. Fiji is a land of song, gentle people, and warmth above and below. I knew this was just the start of so much more to come.   On this live-aboard trip, I spent ten days on the Nai’a with 17 people from around the globe, cruising and diving Fiji’s Bligh Waters. Our itinerary included a return to one of my favorite dive destinations on the planet—the Namena Marine Reserve. Five years ago I made a day trip to Namena’s amazing reefs, diving twice among its brilliantly colored soft corals and huge schools of fish. This time, I was looking forward to several days’ of diving, to really explore Namena’s wonders. There were many memorable moments on the trip. One I will never forget was on the way to Namena when we twice dove the Nigali Passage near Gau Island. You descend just when a strong, tidal current whisks you along a natural amphitheater at 60-90 feet where sharks greet you with outstretched fins. About five minutes into each dive we came upon 25 to 30 gray reef and white tip sharks who were slowly swimming against the current, making lazy circles as they traveled along. It felt so natural, if not a bit surreal, to swim freely amongst them on their daily passage, as compared to a baited shark dive. Instead of watching the show from a sheltered ledge on one of the amphitheater walls, aptly named “the bleachers,” I opted to swim freely, and as our paths crossed, I got an up-close and personal experience with these predators. If the sharks were not enough, the amphitheater empties into two shallow gardens of brilliant corals that are home to hundreds of species of fish. A few days later we reached Namena. We were fortunate to have Didi Dulunaqio, Program Coordinator at the Coral Reef Alliance, come aboard to join us for a meal and inspire us with his personal narrative about the grass-roots creation and success of the Namena Marine Reserve. Didi is a heroic figure throughout dive circles in Fiji. He continues to work with the Kubulau Resource Management Committee and districts to protect and sustain Namena’s reefs and strengthen the partnership forged between CORAL, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the villagers of Kubulau. Namena was spectacular in 2010, but what I saw on this visit was a noticeable step up. If I had to guess, five more years of conservation has yielded a 20 percent increase in the abundance of fish and the density of the corals. We swam among impossibly large schools of trevally, yellowtail, snappers and pelagics, and thousands of golden, orange and pink anthias colored every dive. To see one enormous Napoleon wrasse on a dive is a treat; how about six together? And while catching a glimpse of a pygmy seahorse camouflaged in coral is not atypical on a multi-day dive trip, how about settling in with two pregnant pygmies free swimming back and forth between their perches? Or surfacing from a fantastic dive, only to jump into the water again to free swim for twenty minutes among a school of five manta rays – they seemed just as interested in showing off for us as we were in swimming with them. I’ve been diving on coral reefs since I was 10-years-old. Times are tough for corals, including on some of Fiji’s reefs. But this return to Namena and the Bligh Waters gave me a great deal of hope. It’s evident that when communities unite to save their coral reefs and forge alliances with organizations like CORAL, who have the experience and expertise to help them help themselves, the results can be spectacular. And success in one location has a domino effect on nearby communities who soon want to follow the formula and sustain their reefs. My return to the coral gardens of Namena left me thankful and proud of what collaborative conservation can, and will, accomplish for coral reefs around the world.  "

This stems not only from my personal love of nature but from my belief that all life is interrelated, a belief that drives my work with the Coral Reef Alliance. I learned this early through the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant that explains how life began, our shared genealogy. The ancient chant is more than two thousand lines, practiced, learned and shared over generations. The Kumulipo begins with cosmic darkness. At the time when the earth became hot At the time when the heavens turned about At the time when the sun was darkened To cause the moon to shine The time of the rise of the Pleiades The slime, this was the source of the earth The source of the darkness that made darkness The source of the night that made night The intense darkness, the deep darkness Darkness of the sun, darkness of the night Nothing but night The night gave birth Born was Kumulipo in the night, a male Born was Po‘ele in the night, a female The Kumulipo tells us that the Ko’a, or coral polyp, was the first organism created. The Ko’a was followed by seastars, cucumbers, and urchins, each increasing in complexity. Early translators of the chant noted that the order of species closely matches the biological groupings we use today. Born was the starfish, his child the small starfish came forth Born was the sea cucumber, his child the small sea cucumber came forth Born was the sea urchin, the sea urchin [tribe] The chant teaches us that life in the sea and life on land are inexorably connected, and what we do on land has a direct connection and impact on all organisms in the sea. Hawaiians recognize that these organisms are the building blocks for all life on this shared planet we call Honua. There is a resurgence of interest in the chant as people look for the traditional knowledge of ecological connections. The Kumulipo is always in the background of people’s minds. Born was the tough seagrass living in the sea Guarded by the tough landgrass living on land It is our   (responsibility) to preserve and protect all living organisms because we all come from the same primordial beginnings– ­from the night, from the slime, from the coral polyp. These lessons of the Kumulipo are deeply integrated into our consciousness. It’s something we feel in our  (deep within our being). We are all related, part of one   (family), and it is our responsibility to care for the land under our feet, the sea around us, and our coral reefs.

The Roatan Marine Park (RMP) in Honduras is an inspiring example of how conservation efforts lead to great things. The success and growth they’ve shown are tremendous. Last year, CORAL invested in the sustainability of RMP with a $12,000 grant to hire a sustainable finance coordinator. The new position was designed to help them diversify income streams and build relationships within the private sector. The goal was to increase their capacity so they can expand to new areas of the island and continue to protect Roatan’s unique natural beauty. With the new coordinator, the RMP has grown its membership base by 40 percent—they’ve built stronger relationships with donors, businesses, and community members. They also helped create a U.S. 501(c)3, which allows them to fundraise in the United States. “A lot of visitors come here and want to make a tax-deductible donation to the park,” says Jenny Myton, CORAL’s associate programs director based in Honduras. “This new 501(c)3 makes that possible.” As a result of the coordinator’s hard work, the RMP just received a $100,000 donation from a popular clothing brand. The unrestricted donation will support the sustainable finance coordinator position for the next four years and will help pay for necessary marine management, patrols and community development projects. “The RMP is reaching a new level of independence,” says Myton. “It’s exciting to see that CORAL’s initial investment is paying off. Communities can finance their conservation efforts, and we can use this example as a blueprint for other communities around the world.”"

Launched in 2012 with a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, RTI’s goal was to understand how multiple factors—for example, wave energy, herbivores, and the distribution of coral species on a reef—interact to affect the health of a coral reef. In conjunction with our scientific research, we worked with coral reef managers around the world to understand how they use science to inform their management decisions. We based our scientific research on the remote atoll of Palmyra in the central Pacific. Armed with cameras, clipboards, settlement tiles, temperature data loggers and more, we collected a truly staggering amount of biological, physical, and ecological data. Simultaneously, we worked with communities around the world—including partners in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Palau—to make sure that our scientific work was relevant to conservation and management challenges. Now that we have completed RTI, I wanted to share some of our key findings: We have combined these and other findings into a mathematical model that allows us to explore how climate change might affect reef health by increasing the frequency and intensity of disturbance events. If we know how healthy reefs, like those at Palmyra, can withstand change and recover from disturbance, we may be able to unlock the key to this resilience for other reefs around the globe. While funding for RTI has ended, our collaborative work will continue for years to come as we build on what we have learned from Palmyra and our work with communities around the world."

        "content": "A plane flies low over a turquoise sea off the coast of Queensland in northern Australia. Below lies the largest reef in the world: the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). At first, I think—or maybe it’s hope—that the white patches are boulders or cresting wavelets. But as the plane flies on, their true identity becomes undeniably clear: these are bleached corals. And there are a lot of them. As   taken by researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies makes clear, the GBR is in trouble. Reports indicate that up to 93 percent of corals in the northern part of the reef have bleached. But it’s not just the GBR that’s reporting bleaching: corals in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean, north and south Pacific, and coral triangle are all turning bone-white. What does it mean to say that a coral is bleached? Corals get their colors from tiny algae that live within their tissues. These algae help corals grow by capturing energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. When waters get too warm for too long, these algae go into overdrive and their ramped up metabolism creates a toxic environment for corals. In response, the algae get kicked out, and the corals lose their color. Bleached corals aren’t necessarily dead corals, but the longer the bleaching continues, the lower the chance is that the corals will be able to recover. The current bleaching in the GBR is part of the third recorded global bleaching event. It’s the result of a particularly strong   occurring on top of already elevated global temperatures. Any single event is worrisome, but scientists are seeing an increase in the frequency of bleaching events. This means that corals don’t have the time they need to recover, and this has many people very worried. Only time will tell us how many—or how few—corals will survive this latest event. I had been reading reports of bleaching from around the world for months before I saw that video, so I should have known what to expect. But those thousands of words had not prepared me for a minute-long video. Those of us in conservation like to joke that we are trying really hard to put ourselves out of work. How great would it be if coral reefs no longer needed our help? I have never been so saddened by job security than when I saw all those bleached corals. We have a lot of work still to do. So what can we do? We can reduce local threats to reefs—such as overfishing and water pollution—so that reefs have ‘breathing room’ to recover from disturbances like bleaching. We can urge our politicians to take action on climate change. And we can find ways to support the many communities around the world that are working to protect coral reefs, one of the most wondrous ecosystems on earth."

They live in warm waters at 2-40 meters deep in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and can grow up to 12 inches (31 cm) long. Blue Tang are one of more than 70 species of surgeonfish, a group of fish known for the very sharp spines near the tail. They normally hold these spines close to their body, but they can extend them when threatened. When they are young, they feed exclusively on plankton. As adults they are omnivores, eating both algae and invertebrates, including plankton. Royal Blue tangs play an important role in maintaining the health and balance of coral reefs. Herbivores graze the algae (seaweed) on reefs, similar to cattle or sheep in a field. These herbivores keep the algae in check and keep space open for corals to grown and settle. Without herbivores, algae can overgrow and crowd out corals. Coral reef structure is important to blue tangs who hide in coral branches, crevices and holes to avoid predators like groupers, bar jacks and tuna. Despite how endearing Dory might appear in the movies, the real blue tangs do not make good pets because they need large tanks (which are expensive), a carefully balanced diet, and they are susceptible to disease—therefore they need very experienced aquarists to take care of them. Because this species cannot be bred in captivity, they are currently collected from coral reefs and there is concern that increased demand as a result of  will put too much pressure on wild populations. For all these reasons, this species is better left on a reef or enjoyed at a responsible public aquarium."

        "content": "Coral reefs around the world are being hit hard by many stressors. At the local level, they’re dealing with issues like overfishing and poor water quality. At the global level, they’re facing warming temperatures, more acidic oceans, and stronger storms. With effective management, we can mitigate many local threats. But the global ones are a bit harder. It’s clear that if corals are going to survive global climate change, they are going to have to adapt. The good news is that we know that corals can adapt. They have evolved numerous ways to deal with environmental conditions – for example, some corals thrive in murky river mouths while others flourish in warm-water lagoons. But the pace of climate change is rapid, leaving corals with a small window in which to adjust to rapidly changing conditions. So what can we do to help corals adapt? This was the topic of one of Monday’s sessions at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS). Lead by our very own Dr. Madhavi Colton, the session brought together experts in coral reef biology, genetics, and ecology to answer this very question. Many of the talks in this session focused on assisted evolution—that is, speeding up evolution through direct management. For example, one speaker shared her work creating hybrid corals—similar to work being done to create hybrid tomatoes. If you breed the sperm from one species of coral with the egg from another, can you create a coral that will do better under future conditions? Dr. Adrian Stier of the University of Washington called these predict-and-prescribe approaches. Predict-and-prescribe approaches place bets about what future conditions will look like and which corals will do better under these conditions. If those predictions are correct, then these strategies can be incredibly effective. But according to Stier, they are also inherently risky because they are focused on a few species or genes. What if those bets are wrong? We risk losing the very diversity from which climate change winners could naturally emerge. Instead, Stier advocated following Warren Buffet’s example. Financial markets are like ecosystems in that they are inherently unpredictable (despite what your financial manager might have told you!). In the face of this uncertain future, a smart investment decision is to hedge your bets and diversify your portfolio. Through diverse investments, you are less likely to lose everything and more likely to consistently gets better returns. We can do the same for coral reefs, Stier said. Instead of investing all of our efforts into creating corals of the future, we can protect diverse portfolios of options. We can let nature pick the winners. As one member of the audience stated, if we focus our efforts on reducing local threats—many local threats, not just one or two—and building marine protected areas that are connected to each other, we’ll have a better chance of corals adapting to future environmental changes."

        "content": "For many years, few people paid attention to the impacts that poor water quality has on coral reefs. But this is changing. At the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), many sessions focused on discussing this important issue. Never has the CORAL team been so excited to hear so many talks on sewage, sedimentation, and runoff! Poor water quality impacts most of the reefs around the world. When polluted water enters the ocean, it carries both sediment and nutrients. Sediment can smother a reef, blocking out the sunlight that corals need in order to grow. Nutrients fuel the growth of algae and seaweeds which compete with corals for space. According to a talk by Stephanie Wear of The Nature Conservancy, high levels of nutrients can also lead to higher incidences of coral disease and bleaching. This is particularly relevant today when we’re in the middle of the third global bleaching event. But as Wear pointed out, our efforts to address reef threats are unbalanced: there is more focus on combatting overfishing than on addressing poor water quality. We know that to help corals deal with climate change, we need to reduce all local threats to reefs so that they have the ‘breathing room’ to adapt. However, poor water quality is a complicated issue to address. Often our water quality standards are designed with human health in mind, but this may not be enough to keep corals safe. Also, addressing poor water quality usually means heavy upfront capital investments in infrastructure, which can be a significant hurdle for many communities. The good news is that we know what we need to do. The first step is to help local communities understand the effects of land-based pollution on coral reefs. Dr. Tracy Wiegner’s project at the University of Hawai‘i is a great example of that. A partner with our   project, Wiegner, and her team have helped the Puakō community on Hawai‘i Island understand the effects of poor water quality on their local reef. Their study found that cesspools leak sewage into the nearshore environment in as little as six hours. According to Wiegner, there are 90,000 cesspools in the state of Hawaii, and 50,000 of those are on Hawai‘i Island. Hawai‘i is the last state in the US to ban cesspools, and the second to last state banned them 50 years ago. Work like that of Dr. Wiegner shows linkages between land and reefs, and can be instrumental in motivating communities to take action. The next step is to connect communities with the tools and resources they need to address water pollution. We’re already doing this on  , on  , and in  . With the amount of attention poor water quality received at ICRS this year, we’re optimistic that we will see an increase in global efforts to address these threats in the coming years."

        "content": "Overfishing is a widespread problem across our oceans. As our global human population quickly approaches eight billion, pressures on these ocean resources will only increase. That means bad news for coral reef fish. They are even more vulnerable to overfishing than pelagic (open ocean) fish because of their biology, said Dr. Charles Birkeland in his Tuesday morning plenary session at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS). Coral reef fish are slow growing and long-lived, and there’s ample evidence that older, bigger fish are more fertile and produce young that are better equipped to survive the larval phase. Coral reef fish play a vital role in the coral reef network of life. For example, herbivores, or grazing fish, eat algae and seaweeds and can prevent them from overgrowing corals on a reef. In this morning’s plenary address, Dr. Pete Mumby explained that coral larvae, or baby corals, are less likely to settle on a reef where algae is present. By keeping algae in check, herbivorous reef fish can facilitate coral recruitment and reef recovery. Coral reef fish are also the lifeline for many communities, providing an important source of food and income. That income can come directly from the sale of fish, and can also be generated by tourism (let’s be real, who doesn’t love to see reef fish while on a dive?). Combatting overfishing can therefore benefit communities in multiple ways. For example, one study from Palau quantified the value of sharks to tourism as compared to fisheries and found that sharks were much more valuable alive than dead. The same study found that tax revenue from scuba tourism was 24 times higher than the total revenue of the fishing industry. Birkeland suggested that communities will benefit by limiting reef fish to local markets rather than exporting them. In fact, Palau banned the export of coral reef fish, which has been great news for both reefs and the communities that rely on them. It’s no wonder that so many efforts focus on addressing overfishing on reefs. The stakes are high—500 million people rely on coral reefs. But is addressing overfishing alone really enough to save our coral reefs? Melanie McField from the Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI) says perhaps not in the Caribbean. In a new study of the Mesoamerican Reef region, McField found that the presence of algae on a reef did not correlate with the population of herbivores. External factors like poor water quality also contributed to reef decline. This means that protecting herbivores alone won’t save coral reefs: it’s important to combat overfishing in conjunction with cleaning up water quality, which is what we are doing in Honduras. This is a common thread at ICRS this year. As you’ve read over the last few days, it’s not enough to address a single threat in isolation. We need to take a holistic approach to addressing multiple local threats if coral reefs are going to adapt to the many global changes coming their way."

They negotiated the Paris Agreement—a global agreement on limiting global warming. It was a great example of setting ambitious policy to protect our natural resources. COP 21 has been a popular topic at this year’s International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), the theme of which is bridging science with policy. It’s an important topic—how can we build a stronger partnership between scientists and policy makers to protect coral reefs? For example, the parties at COP 21 vowed to pursue efforts to limit global warming to under 2.0 C; however, according to Dr. Janice Lough in this morning’s plenary session, a 1.5 C increase in temperatures would have drastic effects on coral reefs. Using data from a variety of sources, Dr. Lough showed that our Earth has already warmed by 1.0 C since the early 1800s. Given that we’ve just witnessed some of the worst coral bleaching in history and that we haven’t hit the 1.5 C mark yet, people are understandably worried. In this instance we definitely need to bridge the gap between science and policy—we need more scientists like Lough to stand up and say that a 2.0 C goal isn’t good enough, and we need policy makers who will listen and respond. There’s a piece missing to that though, and one that we can’t ignore. Local communities are the ones that depend on coral reefs and that will suffer the most if we lose our reefs. They aren’t the ones going to conferences like COP 21 though, and they aren’t always the ones conducting the scientific research. How do we make sure their voices are heard, and their resources are protected? How can we help these communities be strong and resilient in the face of these looming global shifts? We can do what we at CORAL do best—we can help them manage their natural resources. We can continue working in places like Fiji, where we’ve helped the Kubulau community autonomously manage the Namena Marine Reserve. We can continue supporting communities in Bali with their efforts building locally-managed marine protected areas (MPAs). We can continue working with our partners around the world to ensure communities benefit socially, financially and culturally from conservation. As numerous talks at ICRS have pointed out, strong management that effectively reduces local threats can buy corals the time they need to adapt to changing environmental conditions."

According to preliminary results from Dr. David Gill, many marine protected areas (MPAs) have inadequate staffing and financial resources for management activities and this could be affecting their ecological performance. Thankfully, at this year’s International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), we learned about various creative conservation financing mechanisms being developed and implemented around the world. Our favorite example is from   in Honduras (note: we may be a bit biased!). Jenny Myton, our Associate Programs Director for the Mesoamerican region, presented on their model this afternoon. In 2009 we helped RMP develop a business plan. From that plan, they’ve become 100% self-sustaining financially. They’ve created merchandise shops that bring in a third of their total revenue, and another third comes from the sale of voluntary dive tags. As you may have read in a previous blog post, in 2015 we gave RMP a $12,000 grant to hire a sustainable finance coordinator. They’ve since multiplied that amount astronomically, covering the costs of the position for the next several years as well as an expansion of marine park patrols to new areas. The example from RMP demonstrates that if we invest smartly and efficiently in building local management entities, we can help communities autonomously manage their resources in the long-term. Together, we can help empower communities to protect their coral reefs."

        "content": "In a natural landscape, trees and soil help soak up rainwater, but in developed or urban landscapes, rainwater falls onto streets, parking lots, roofs, or other non-absorbent surfaces like concrete and asphalt. Instead of sinking into the ground, rainwater runs off the land, picking up harmful pollutants like nutrients, pesticides, petroleum residues, and sediments along the way.  During heavy rains, the water that runs off the landscape is called stormwater. Eventually stormwater ends up in our oceans – either by traveling down storm drains or by flowing into waterways like rivers and streams that lead to the ocean. When polluted stormwater flows into the nearshore environment, it  . Nutrient pollution enables the overgrowth of algae which can kill corals by smothering them, blocking their access to sunlight and promoting coral disease. High levels of sediment runoff can also kill corals by suffocating them and blocking their access to sunlight. In Hawaiʻi, stormwater pollution is an island chain-wide problem. Because of our often steep topography and prevalence of altered landscapes (like concrete and deforested agricultural lands), most stormwater follows a quick path straight to the ocean. Large storm events in the islands can transfer so many pollutants into our coastal waters that the Department of Health has to issue “Brown Water Advisories” – warnings to the public that the water is potentially contaminated and poses a health threat to swimmers. A Brown Water Advisory is being issued for the island of Maui due to recent heavy rains. The public is advised to stay out of flood waters and storm water runoff due to possible overflowing cesspools, sewer manholes, pesticides, animal fecal matter, dead animals, pathogens, chemicals, and associated flood debris. Not all waters may be affected, however, if the water is brown stay out and continue to practice good personal hygiene. Follow up with your primary care physician if you have any health concerns.” Stormwater in Hawaiʻi not only poses a threat to coral reefs and human health but also negatively impacts the economy by causing a loss in revenue for the tourist industry. It causes a host of other environmental problems like polluting streams and denuding the land of important topsoil needed for agriculture. In West Maui, fallow agricultural lands and the design of dirt roads within these plantations has created easy pathways for sediment to travel to the ocean. Lack of ground cover, the slope of the land, and frequent heavy rains create perfect conditions to transport topsoil with all its contaminants down to coral reefs. In West Maui, CORAL’s   Initiative focuses on preventing sediment and nutrient pollution from reaching the ocean and degrading reefs.  We take a   (“ridge to reef”) approach to restore the natural function of a watershed to filter stormwater and absorb nutrients, sediments and other chemicals.  We work with farmers, Hawaiian communities, local nonprofits, private businesses, and the government to restore streams, which capture and stabilize sediments and nutrients so that they don’t flow into the ocean. We are piloting stream restoration techniques that combine modern technology with native vegetation and traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices. For example, we are planting deep-rooted vetiver grasses to help stabilize soil, absorb nutrients and pollutants, increase ground water infiltration, and improve the environment for successful replanting of native vegetation. When vetiver sediment traps are planted within dirt road “kickouts”, they can hold runoff from road segments, detaining water for long enough for sediments to soak into the soil, rather than flow into streams. These actions not only restore streams and prevent pollutants from entering the ocean, but they also lead to a whole host of benefits like restoring ecosystem services, improving habitat for species, and creating recreational opportunities for communities. If you live on Maui and are interested in playing a role in this important work,   You can help plant native plants, create sand bag corridors, and take part in other fun stream restoration activities!

You can also help reduce stormwater pollution and safeguard coral reefs year-round by reducing pesticide and chemical use in your yard, and/or by implementing low impact design (LID) solutions like   or   in your home or workplace.

One of the key findings of the HRI Report Card is that the long-term dedication and collaboration of groups like CORAL in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) has paid off, leading to direct and measurable improvements in reef health. Despite the fact that corals worldwide were hard-hit by mass bleaching over the last few years, 10 years of reef monitoring by HRI – from over 300 sites across 1000 kilometers and four countries – tells us that things are looking up in the MAR. The positive trend is attributed to   and a significant  , which now cover 57% of the MAR. Legal protection and local management actions like no-fishing zones can lead to a measurable and positive shift in the number and size of fish.

Second, it tells us that the strategies that CORAL has been employing in our twelve years of engagement in the MAR are exactly the right things to be doing.  . For over 15 years, we have been working in West End, supporting and building the capacity of Roatán Marine Park (RMP), our long-time partners and co-managers of the Bay Islands National Marine Park. Nowhere is the success of our approach more evident than in the recent declaration of the Tela Bay Marine Wildlife Refuge. Thanks to the hard work of CORAL and partners, in early 2018 the Honduran national government approved the declaration of this new marine protected area, which covers 86,259 hectares of reefs and coastal ocean. Hiding in Tela Bay’s unassuming murky waters are some of the healthiest coral reefs in all of the Caribbean. Scientific surveys have shown that Tela Bay supports a staggering sixty-nine percent of live coral cover, which is more than three times the average coral cover in the Caribbean. The bay supports forty-six coral species, eighty-three fish species and eighteen types of marine habitats. It is also home to healthy populations of elkhorn and staghorn coral – a rare distinction given that these critically endangered species have declined by eighty percent over the past thirty years. The refuge will not only ensure the future of this stunning ecosystem, it will also enable the coral reefs to continue to provide food and economic opportunities to the thirteen coastal communities that live on its shores. As part of our efforts to protect the unique reefs of Tela Bay, CORAL also played a key role in the declaration of Honduras’ first coastal managed-access fishery in   – a lagoon near Tela Bay where juvenile reef fishes grow up.  This managed-access fishery creates an important model for fisheries reform in the southern MAR. We’re continuing our work with local partners to ensure protection of this marine treasure through projects that create win-wins for people and reefs, such as supporting alternative livelihoods to reduce unsustainable fishing in Tela Bay and the neighboring  Amid the often gloomy messages about the fate of coral reefs, we feel it’s important to acknowledge and celebrate the hard-earned conservation successes by dedicated communities of people who care deeply about the future of reefs – from non-profits and the dive community to governments and local fishing communities. We look forward to seeing what more we can accomplish together! En enero de 2018, compartimos los resultados del informe de Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI, La Iniciativa de Arrecifes Saludables, por sus siglas en inglés) sobre el estado y las tendencias de la salud de los arrecifes en el Arrecife Mesoamericano (SAM). Uno de los hallazgos clave del Reporte de HRI es que la dedicación y colaboración a largo plazo de grupos como CORAL en el Arrecife Mesoamericano (SAM) ha dado sus frutos, lo que ha llevado a mejoras directas y medibles en la salud del arrecife. A pesar de que los corales de todo el mundo se vieron muy afectados por el blanqueamiento masivo en los últimos años, 10 años de monitoreo de arrecifes por parte de HRI, en más de 300 sitios a lo largo de 1000 kilómetros y cuatro países, nos dicen que las cosas están mejorando en el SAM. La tendencia positiva se atribuye a un   y un aumento significativo de las , que ahora cubren el 57% del SAM. La protección legal y las acciones de gestión local, como las zonas prohibidas para la pesca, pueden conducir a un cambio medible y positivo en el número y tamaño de los peces.

Los   son alentadores por dos razones: primero, nos dice que hay acciones sencillas y concretas que podemos tomar para ayudar a los corales a adaptarse a los desafíos inmediatos en su entorno. En segundo lugar, nos dice que las estrategias que CORAL ha estado implementando en nuestros doce años de participación en el SAM son exactamente lo que hay que hacer.  . Llevamos más de 15 años trabajando en West End, apoyando y reforzando la capacidad del Parque Marino de Roatán (RMP), nuestros aliados de siempre y cogestores del Parque Nacional Marino de las Islas de la Bahía. En ninguna parte es más evidente el éxito de nuestro enfoque que en la reciente declaración del Refugio de Vida Silvestre Marina de la Bahía de Tela. Gracias al arduo trabajo de CORAL y sus aliados, a principios de 2018 el gobierno nacional hondureño aprobó la declaración de esta nueva área marina protegida, que abarca 86,259 hectáreas de arrecifes y océano costero. Escondidos en las modestas aguas turbias de la Bahía de Tela se encuentran algunos de los arrecifes de coral más saludables de todo el Caribe. Las investigaciones científicas han demostrado que la Bahía de Tela mantiene un asombroso sesenta y nueve por ciento de cobertura de coral vivo, lo que supone más de tres veces la cobertura media de coral en el Caribe. La bahía alberga cuarenta y seis especies de coral, ochenta y tres especies de peces y dieciocho tipos de hábitats marinos. También alberga poblaciones sanas de coral cuerno de alce y cuerno de ciervo, una distinción poco común dado que estas especies, en peligro crítico de extinción, han disminuido un ochenta por ciento en los últimos treinta años. El refugio no sólo garantizará el futuro de este impresionante ecosistema, sino que también permitirá que los arrecifes de coral sigan proporcionando alimentos y oportunidades económicas a las trece comunidades costeras que viven en sus orillas. Como parte de nuestros esfuerzos para proteger los arrecifes únicos de la Bahía de Tela, CORAL también desempeñó un papel clave en la declaración de la primera pesquería costera de acceso controlado en la  , una laguna cercana a la Bahía de Tela donde crecen los peces juveniles de los arrecifes. Esta pesquería de acceso controlado crea un modelo importante para la reforma pesquera en el sur del SAM.

But this year, Easter week alone saw a loss of $283.4 million USD and nearly 30,000 jobs. The local communities who depend on that revenue and income felt the effects acutely. CORAL has partnered with local Bay Island communities since 2005 to build programs that reduce the impact of tourism on the reef and to ensure proceeds from tourism benefit communities and the environment. But perhaps even more importantly, we’ve helped the communities build programs that allow them to become resilient to setbacks, including COVID-19. When tourism suddenly came to an abrupt halt, CORAL and its local partners immediately got to work. We united with Go Blue Bay Islands and various tourism industry and government representatives to create a local committee that could help the region safely reopen its tourism economy. The popular committee soon expanded into a national committee and began addressing tourism safety across the country. Together the team created The Tourism Revitalization Plan*, which outlines biosecurity guidelines and best practices that provide a framework for restarting tourism responsibly and safely. “One of the greatest values of these guidelines is that they come from a joint approach that promotes inclusivity and applicability,” says Ms. Syntia Solomon, President of the Bay Islands Tourism Bureau and one of the founders of Go Blue Bay Islands. “Our destination and businesses must reopen, and we must restart domestic and international tourism responsibly and safely. To achieve this, all cross-sector businesses, regardless of size, must put in clear, sustainable and practical protocols.” The document has outlined protocols for businesses across sectors, like hotels, restaurants, tour operators, dive centers, rental car companies, beaches, gift shops and more. Some of the protocols are fairly familiar—like ensuring ease of access to hand-washing stations, requiring face masks, and encouraging social distancing. Others focus on ensuring employees and tourism operators are trained to recognize and address risks. And some outline clear response procedures for when an employee or community member tests positive. Just like coral reefs, when human communities are able to shift and adapt in times of crisis, they can stand strong—and even thrive—when faced with shocks and stresses. By listening to our local partners and acting based on their feedback, and by ensuring local communities have a united voice and the resources they need to weather periods of uncertainty, we can help the Bay Islands bounce back and reopen safely. “One of the most incredible things about the Bay Islands is our proximity the Mesoamerican Reef,” says Tanya Amaya, CORAL’s Program Manager in the Bay Islands. “Our economy is built around people coming from across the globe to experience its magic and enjoy our beautiful beaches. We’re hopeful that with these new protocols, we’ll be able to reopen the economy safely and begin welcoming visitors again.”  "

        "content": "As Executive Director of the Roatán Marine Park, Francis Lean can relate to her tourist clientele—she used to be one of them. Originally from Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, Lean used to join the 1.6 million people who visited Roatán on vacation each year. Roatán is one of the three main islands that make up the Bay Island chain on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. Its economy is highly dependent upon tourism, and travelers from around the world flock to the island to enjoy its beautiful white sand beaches and turquoise waters. The Roatán Marine Park (RMP) is one of 14 organizations that are responsible for day-to-day management of the resources within the Bay Islands National Marine Park, the largest marine protected area in Honduras. Like many businesses and organizations on the island, RMP is almost entirely reliant upon tourism—85% of its operating budget is tied to tourism, both directly and indirectly. So when COVID-19 led to widespread global lockdowns and a sudden halt in tourism, it hit the community and RMP like a ton of bricks. Overnight, their revenue plummeted. Their four gift shops, which typically account for nearly half of their revenue, no longer had any customers. Donations from tourists stopped coming. Hotels, restaurants and dive shops halted their sponsorships as they struggled to cover their own expenses. “We couldn’t believe it. It was very scary,” describes Lean. “Personally, I was very positive, thinking it would be over in a few days or a couple of weeks. But after a couple of weeks, I realized that we were going to have to make some tough decisions and prioritize.” The RMP team decided that maintaining their patrols was their top priority. “With everything that was happening, people were going to head to the ocean to get food,” says Lean. “We needed to make sure they did it sustainably.” As predicted, from April to June RMP saw a 150% increase in poaching compared to the same period last year. But paying for patrols meant they had to make cuts elsewhere. The non-patrol staff agreed to cut their hours and their salaries by 50%, and they closed all but one of their gift shops. Despite the hardships, Lean says RMP has been fairly resilient overall. She attributes much of that resilience to the relationships and collaborations they have in the community, which, she says, is largely a result of the support they have received from CORAL over the years. She highlighted their partnership with the Honduran Navy as an example, something CORAL helped establish. Every RMP patrol boat carries two members of the Navy to help with enforcement and safety. With five patrol boats, that’s at least ten Navy members per day. Typically, her staff would drive to another part of the island to pick up the Navy members from their base and bring them to the park office before each patrol. But with resources and time now a scarce commodity, community members have stepped up to house and feed Navy members locally and donate fuel for the patrol boats. RMP staff members also have taken to digital fundraising and marketing efforts. “We’re going digital,” says Lean. “We opened up a store online so now we can sell our products online, and we’re doing online fundraising also.” And with CORAL’s help, they have received a few grants to help cover some of their operating costs. CORAL has also created the Honduras COVID Reef Rescue Fund to solicit donations for RMP. Slowly, tourists are starting to return to the island. “People are feeling more positive now,” says Lean. “People are starting to work again and some of the dive shops are starting to get a small trickle of customers.” Looking forward, Lean knows they will be feeling the impacts of this downturn for years to come. But she’s confident in the organization’s ability to adapt and sees these past few months as an opportunity for the community and local businesses to reassess and reevaluate how they operate. At RMP, they are brainstorming new ways to diversify their revenue stream and are looking to secure more grant funding to make that happen. In the meantime, Lean encourages people to start following the Roatán Marine Park on social media and visit Roatán again. “The island is here waiting for you guys to come see it and take care of it,” pitches Lean. “This is the time to come to Roatán—the reef has taken a break from people, and that’s a good thing.”"

        "content": "Local scientists from CORAL and the   made an exciting, new discovery during this year’s coral reef monitoring in Trujillo, Honduras. With the help of nearby fishers, they found multiple sites of new coral reefs that have not previously been monitored or studied by the local scientific community. For a while, local scientists suspected there were new reefs, but were unable to find them due to bad weather and other complications. “This is great news and we’re hoping it is just the tip of the iceberg,” says CORAL Conservation Program Director Jenny Myton. “It’s possible that there are even more reefs nearby.”  Trujillo’s newfound reefs are functional and have an estimated 12 to 16 percent live coral cover, compared to Trujillo’s average cover of just nine percent. If properly protected, new reefs in Trujillo may be beneficial for the entire Mesoamerican reef region.   According to HRI scientist Ian Drysdale, Trujillo’s new reefs are considered a “sister” to the reefs in Tela Bay, which are more than 100 kilometers away. This is because the dominant type of coral on the reefs is the same, as are many of the surrounding fish and wildlife. Studies show that fish connectivity between the two regions is high, with some scientists hypothesizing that Trujillo actually is a source of fish larvae for all of Honduras.   In fact, there is connectivity between coral reefs in many parts of Mesoamerica due to ocean currents. While  , reef-building corals release male and female reproductive cells known as gametes, which join together to form baby coral. The offspring then ride the current for up to three weeks before eventually attaching to a hard surface to grow.  “Marine currents can be very strong,” says Drysdale. “When massive spawning events happen [in Mesoamerica], it is in the rainy season with high winds, storms, and currents. This can send offspring farther away, versus when we have flat, calm seas.”  By discovering, monitoring, and protecting new reefs, like the ones found in Trujillo, we will also protect corals found in other parts of the ocean. With this knowledge in mind, CORAL works to establish healthy coral reef networks throughout Mesoamerica, thus protecting vital coral species, coastal communities, and surrounding wildlife.  When examining the Trujillo reefs, both Drysdale and CORAL Program Coordinator Paolo Guardiola noticed a lack of fish and physical evidence of reef damage, which point to signs of overfishing.  “We saw anchor scars,” says Drysdale, discussing the devastating damage found on an entire row of barrel sponges amongst the reef. “An anchor went right across [the sponges] and the scar was more than a meter wide and 15 meters long.” When protecting a network of sister reefs, it is important to address the direct threats facing each area. By minimizing overfishing and irresponsible practices in Trujillo, we will also improve the health of reefs in other locations.  That’s why CORAL turns directly to the local community in Honduras, working side by side with community scientists and local fishers to secure healthy fish populations for different reefs in the region.  “For about two and a half years, we’ve been collecting data to build a fisheries management plan,” says Guardiola. “If we protect reefs in Trujillo, we’ll also improve the local economy. Fishers will be able to collect larger fish and at higher quantities.” This ongoing data is shared with key stakeholders, like NGOS, local governments, and fishing communities, in order to create awareness and promote sustainable fishing practices that protect coral reefs.  As we continue to learn about Trujillo’s new coral reefs and the threats they face, our team, local scientists, and members of the community can continue to evolve practices and push for new protection measures—so coral reefs in Mesoamerica can continue to thrive for generations to come.  "

This June, many of the world’s top coral reef scientists met at the International Coral Reef Symposium in Hawaii to discuss the challenges facing coral reefs. Sunscreen and other personal care product ingredients were hot topics. Of particular concern to scientists was oxybenzone, a chemical used in sunscreens to protect our skin from damaging UV light. Oxybenzone is bad news for corals, harming them by; Perhaps most alarming is that all of this can happen with very low doses of the chemical, only 62 parts per trillion (equivalent to one drop of water in 6.5 Olympic swimming pools)! Sunscreen can enter the water directly from our bodies while swimming, or it can wash off the sand at the beach. Spray-on sunscreens especially create a chemical cloud that often misses the skin and settles on the sand. As the tide comes in, all these chemicals wash into the ocean;   found higher oxybenzone concentrations in the ocean at high tide than low tide. Sunscreen chemicals can also enter the ocean in treated wastewater after it is washed off in the shower or excreted through urine. So what can we do?

At a global scale, rising carbon dioxide levels are heating our planet. The recent El Niño, along with elevated temperatures, is causing widespread and devastating bleaching around the world. Dr. David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park Authority, shared how much of the GBR has been impacted by cyclones over the past decade. Recently, unusually warm water bathed the untouched northern part of the GBR, causing severe bleaching of  . At a local level, ICRS dedicated several sessions to the impacts of poor water quality on reefs, highlighting the important connections between land and sea. Other talks focused on the roles of herbivores in combating algae, and how over-fishing has reduced herbivore populations in many areas. Fortunately, amongst the bad news, there were some things that gave me hope. I felt a palpable sense of urgency at ICRS. Rather than being another scientific conference at which to learn about cool but esoteric research, this meeting actively sought to apply new knowledge to conserving coral reefs. To me, this underscores the importance of the work we are doing at CORAL to unite communities to save coral reefs. We can create the conditions for corals to survive climate change by building strong and effective management systems in which local people have the capacity and financial support for management. It’s also clear that this alone won’t be enough: humans need to drastically reduce emissions. I’m hopeful that the recent COP21 agreement ratified in Paris will create incentives for governments to act. It’s clear that time is running out for reefs and many other ecosystems: we need to act now if we want future generations to experience the wonder of coral reefs."

Did you know that some of the 129 species of butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae) are “mucus munchers?” As strange as it might sound, some butterflyfish take advantage of energy-rich coral mucus as a primary food source. Corals produce mucus as a protective layer or use its stickiness to trap food.  Butterflyfish feed on this nutrient rich layer and take advantage of this easy to consume food source. Other butterflyfish species feed on coral polyps or small invertebrates and plankton. Butterflyfish are fairly small and laterally flattened – they look like a disc with rounded fins. They are found around the world on coral reefs and are brightly colored, often with some combination of yellow, black and white. Many butterflyfish species are monogamous and territorial. You will often see a pair swimming together on a reef, although some species roam farther and in larger groups. They are active in the daytime and hide in crevices at night to avoid predators. When butterflyfish reproduce, they release buoyant eggs that float with plankton that once hatched, go through a larval stage where the tiny fish have plate-like armor, before growing into miniature adults. Next time you visit a reef, keep an eye out for these beautiful reef fish and see how many species you can identify."

One of the greatest rewards is meeting and working with such diverse groups of people and building strong connections with the communities in Fiji. Following Tropical Cyclone Winston, l discovered just how passionately connected to the Kubulau community I had become. I wanted to do more to help, and in July, I had an amazing opportunity to connect on a much larger scale at the inaugural Melanesian Spearhead Group, Emerging Leaders Program. Here, I learned about new ways to help community’s recovery from devastation and hardships caused by such a catastrophic storm. During the Melanesian Youth Leaders Forum, I met people from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji. We all shared our successes and challenges and along the way, we gathered valuable and shareable lessons. We were welcomed by the President of Vanuatu the Honorable Baldwin Jacobson Lonsdale in a traditional welcoming ceremony. The four-day program was in two broad parts: presentations by different organizations in the morning and traveling to field sites to see how the work is carried out in different parts of Efate. The most inspiring session was with the Minister for Lands, the Honorable Ralph Regenvanu. He spoke eloquently about his experiences growing up in the midst of Vanuatu fighting (to gain independence), and how they shaped and influenced his decisions. He realized early the importance of culture and traditions and that led him to study anthropology. When he saw that the work he was doing was being undermined by the way land issues were being handled, he returned to school to study law and then went into politics because the only way he felt he could make real changes was from the inside. The biggest takeaway emerged from the afternoon field site visits and the work being done by Wan Smol Bag, Activ, and Lapita. These three companies have managed to continue to work despite the challenges faced during and post-Tropical Cyclone Pam. Compared to Fiji’s recent Tropical Cyclone Winston, there are many similarities in the adversity they faced and how they are working on recovery. Activ is a company that sells local handicrafts and teaches those in the community how to make quality goods. Lapita is a bakery, owned by an indigenous local, who sources products within the community. Visiting these businesses, I immediately imagined how we could replicate these ideas in Fiji. These local practices perfectly pair with CORAL’s conservation work to create and support marine protected areas in an effort to create alternative livelihoods and lessen the reliance on coral reef resources. A unique lesson I learned is how theater and arts are used to share messages, or even provide meaningful alternative activities for young people. At present, much of the recovery effort has focused on basic necessities such as delivery of food, water, and rebuilding materials. Moving forward there is an opportunity to provide more support for emotional and psychological support for victims of Tropical Cyclone Winston. In Vanuatu, I saw the positive impacts that theater and arts played in helping communities cope with trauma. A lesson I can take back to Fiji. This forum is a powerful example of what can happen when you unite people from various communities from around the globe. I left the forum with new friends and ideas about how to help Fiji communities continue to recover from disaster. I look forward to sharing this knowledge with CORAL and the communities at the forefront of local conservation efforts here in Fiji."

While there, I was invited to visit some coral reefs off the West coast of Sulawesi. It was rumored that some areas had 100 percent live coral cover, so I jumped at the chance to go and see for myself. Before I tell you what I saw in the water, I need to explain just how skeptical I was of the reported health of those reefs. I have completed more than 1,000 coral surveys in the past few years with Reef Check Australia and other research groups. In my experience, when people say a reef has 100 percent live coral cover it is usually closer to 70 percent. So, it was with some skepticism that I headed off to Sulawesi take a closer look. To get to the dive site I took a 30-minute boat ride from the city of Makassar in Southwest Sulawesi to Pulau Badi. The area off Makassar is heavily fished, using both cyanide and bombs, so I was not sure what I would find when I jumped into the water. What greeted me was amazing. There truly was 100 percent live coral cover. I hadn’t seen reefs like this ever before. They were beautiful—not many fish, but so much coral diversity. Moreover, I didn’t see any signs of bleaching, the global bleaching event of the last few years seemed to have left these corals untouched. What I found most interesting is that these healthy patches of coral were next to areas that had been bombed for fishing. These areas were not recovering due to unstable coral rubble being swept around in the currents. A group of us went to visit Pulau Badi to see how Mars Symbioscience is investing in restoring these damaged sections of reef. We hope to learn how some of these strategies might be applied to reefs in Bali. Ultimately, it is a relief to know that places like this still exist; that there are bright spots where corals are adapting and thriving, despite warming waters and the pressure of human activities. I got back on the boat a bit more inspired and determined to work ever more diligently to protect special places like this, and to reduce threats in places where coral health is poor. It is a reminder that corals can survive and adapt to a rapidly changing world. As humans, we just need to make sure that we are doing all that we can to support healthy reefs. This is an area of the reef that is damaged from bomb fishing.     Pak Eka from Les Village snorkels in Pulau Badi and learns how Mars Symbioscience is stabilizing and restoring coral reef damaged by bomb fishing.   Here is an area on the same reef with healthy coral cover.

I’m sitting around a kava bowl with community elders, and we are discussing how to protect and conserve their marine resources. You see, this community depends on coral reefs, but the reefs are facing mounting threats. The elders are concerned: they want to ensure there are fish in the sea for their grandchildren and great grandchildren. I am here, in Fiji, as part of my work with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), and at the request of communities who have asked us to help them create effective and durable approaches to coral conservation. I am here to help save coral reefs. CORAL has worked in Fiji for the past 15 years. We’ve worked closely with the resource management committee in the Kubulau district—also known as the KRMC. The Kubulau community has traditional ownership of the Namena Marine Reserve—one of the largest   (no take) areas in Fiji. Through training and micro-grants, we have helped the KRMC increase its management capacity, including establishing a voluntary fee program for visitors. In 2015, the community raised more than $20,000 to support the Namena Marine Reserve, community infrastructure projects and scholarship programs that have benefitted more than 170 students. Over the last decade, we have seen the community’s capacity and autonomy grow. This was proven in February during the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Winston—a category 5 storm that passed directly over Kubulau. Following the storm, KRMC had the resources they needed to start the recovery process without opening their   area to fishing. By not using their marine resources, the community is helping the reef recover from the storm. (You can read more about KRMC’s post-Winston efforts  .) CORAL continues to play an important role in Kubulau and we have been pursuing ways to share our knowledge with other communities. This work bolsters efforts by the Fijian government to include 30 percent of its ocean in marine protected areas (MPAs) by 2020. Our work has paid off. We are thrilled to announce that thanks to a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of State we will expand our work to Cakaudrove, Ra and Lau provinces. In fact, we’ve already begun, and during my recent visit, I met with elders and community members from these provinces. What I learned is that each community approaches conservation in a different way. There is a unique opportunity in  . The elders are working with the government to launch a new nearshore management zoning pilot project. The project will identify different use zones in the marine environment such as fishing,  , and tourism. If successful, this approach could be rolled out to other communities across the country. is situated across the Bligh Passage from Namena Marine Reserve and many of its communities were hit hard by tropical cyclone Winston. In Ra, a number of governmental and non-governmental initiatives are underway to help improve management of marine protected areas. Oneta is 200 miles across open ocean from Fiji’s capital Suva. Part of the   province, this island is less than three miles long and is surrounded by an atoll of reefs. Conservation in Lau is more localized; many communities have established   areas through traditional agreements and with little outside support. The community on Oneata reached out to Fiji’s Provincial Conservation Officer from the iTaukei Affairs Board for help. They connected the community to CORAL. Together with partners, we will help these communities strengthen their approaches to conservation. Through training in topics like fisheries enforcement and financial administration, we will build the capacity of local communities to effectively manage their resources. We will use what we’ve learned from our work in Kubulau as the basis for building a network of effectively managed areas in Fiji. I look forward to my next visit to Fiji, to sitting down with community leaders to drink kava and talk about how we can save reefs. We look forward to once again sharing what we learn so that our collective successes can guide and shape conservation work across the entire region. We can save coral reefs for the children of today and tomorrow."

Scattered reports were coming through the little transistor radio my mum kept for emergencies, and for the days and weeks that followed, it would prove to be an incredibly valuable device. My first instinct was to check on our partners and friends in Kubulau— they were in the direct path of the Category 5 cyclone. There was absolutely no way to reach them. The communication towers for both phone networks in Fiji were down. As reports started coming in from other communities and the devastation they faced, I began to worry. Did Kubulau make it? What had they lost? What did this mean for the Namena Marine Reserve and their pristine coral reefs? CORAL is closely tied with the people and districts within Kubulau. Since 2005, we have helped develop and create an effective and sustainable community group that manages the district’s natural marine resources, the Kubulau Resource Management Committee (KRMC). As I was about to discover, the KRMC proved its worth in the wake of Winston—not only to the people of Kubulau, but also to the reefs within the Namena Marine Reserve. Early Tuesday morning, when the cell towers were restored, I received a call from Peni Were, the coordinator for the KRMC. I was apprehensive about taking it—what could I say to someone who had potentially lost everything in the strongest cyclone to hit this side of the planet? My anxiety was quickly allayed by the decisiveness of our conversation. He spoke quickly through their harrowing experience. When I asked what they needed he sounded like he was reading off a list; pinch bars, hammers, cutters, and most urgent of all, chainsaws. He said, “Right after the cyclone, the KRMC organized all able-bodied men to begin clearing fallen trees on the roads and in the villages. In the last 24 hours, we’ve reached all accessible villages except three and have collected figures on the extent of damages.” In just three days, while most other communities in Fiji were still in crisis mode, this district had proactively begun their rehabilitation without outside assistance. As assessments conducted by the government’s Disaster Management Center indicated, the Kubulau district was one of the worst hit in Vanua Levu with more than 80 percent of houses destroyed. The quick recovery process is a result of their strong communal, traditional and familial ties. These attributes transferred to the KRMC and together, they were able to respond and fund their immediate recovery needs. Kubulau suffered great losses to their iqoliqoli (traditional fishing grounds). The local fishermen had two accessible iqoliqoli, and after Winston, one of them was completely destroyed; it was all sand. Despite this, they did not have to open up their tabus (restricted fishing areas). The reef fees they collect go into a community fund and savings account. This means the communities of Kubulau had the financial resources they needed to get by and make up for lost fishing and tourism incomes. As I was about to hang up, Peni told me that Paulo Kolikata, the recipient of the 2015 CORAL Conservation Prize, wanted to speak with me. The first thing he said was, “Isa Lisi, na nodatou vale sa yali” which means “Isa Lisi, our home is gone.” It hit me hard. In the iTaukei language, to say nodatou was to include me as a member of his home. We shared the loss. I choked back on tears as I thought of the lovely pale yellow concrete home that had billeted me just two weeks earlier. I returned to Kubulau three weeks after Winston. It was difficult, but I did not openly cry when I saw the destruction—it served no purpose; it would not bring back what was lost. What I could do was become an amplifier, to take the data and stories I had gathered and find ways to give back. Even though the state of their environment was dire, and the pain and grief of those affected could be heard under their cheery voices, what stood out most prominently was their resilience and their determination to move on, rebuild and grow. To note: Together, we grieved and supported our partners and friends in Kubulau. Thanks to CORAL’s generous supporters, we were able to send the KRMC more than $5,000 to buy chainsaws, gasoline and other much-needed equipment and tools."

Healthy reefs act as natural barriers that protect coastal cities, communities and beaches from pounding ocean waves. Without coral reefs, many beaches and buildings would become vulnerable to waves and storm damage. And with increasing storm intensity predicted as our climate warms, these coastal protection services will become even more important. Research conducted on Palmyra Atoll by members of the   found that pristine coral reefs dampen much more wave energy than expected. In other words, healthy reefs are better at protecting coastlines from wave and storm damage. Conversely, a reef that is not as healthy (perhaps due to poor water quality or overfishing) is less able to absorb or dissipate wave energy. This creates a negative feedback loop: less healthy reefs take more of a beating which leads to—you guessed it!—even less healthy reefs. Over time, this can cause previously protected coastlines to become more susceptible to wave and storm damage.

Because of these concerns, we have been working with our partners in these and other villages along the north coast of Bali to establish a network of well-managed marine protected areas that are ecologically connected and socioeconomically sustainable. Effectively managing this network requires the support of local communities. To garner this support, community concerns and knowledge must be understood and incorporated into management plans. To build an effective management plan, we partnered with Lens of the Community of Indonesia and asked villagers to use photos to document their natural environments, cultures, traditions and lifestyles. The photos tell powerful stories about how community members interact with nature and can identify issues and challenges that may affect management priorities. In both Tulamben and Amed, the photos identified sedimentation, trash and tourism activities as major threats to reefs. This was the first time community members had an opportunity to voice their concerns and their vision of their future and the future of their reefs. These photos can be used to build management plans and help governments and local NGOs better prioritize conservation initiatives.

Five hundred million people around the world depend on reef fish and other animals for food and income. In addition to providing a significant source of protein for up to a billion people, coral reef fish support commercial and artisanal fisheries and serve as a key tourist attraction. By one estimate, the coral reef global fishing and tourism industries are worth four hundred billion dollars each year. Many fish populations around the world, however, are overfished. Overfishing can harm reef ecosystems by removing fish that perform essential functions—for example, when too many herbivorous fish are harvested, reefs become overgrown with macroalgae (seaweed). Overfishing can also harm the communities that depend on reefs for income. Groupers are one type of fish that can be sold for a high value and given such, many species of groupers are overfished. Groupers naturally come together to spawn and such a fish aggregation can be very easy to harvest. Creating well-managed local fisheries helps fish populations like the grouper to recover after harvesting events and ensures that local communities can earn income over the long term. One way we work to create more sustainable fisheries is by the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), which are locations in which some (or all) types of fishing are banned. Over time and within an MPA, fish populations are able to increase and some fish will inevitably move out of the restricted area. In addition, fish within the MPA grow older and larger—they become “ ” (which actually is a real term used among researches that stands for “big old fat fecund female fishes), which produce more and better young. In these two ways, MPAs can help fish populations increase outside the MPA.

Sharks are commonly misunderstood and widely feared. These remarkable animals, however, are valuable to the tourism industry and the economic health of coral reef destinations. A   from the Australian Institute of Marine Science found that shark tourism accounts for approximately eight percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the island nation of Palau. The study showed that the roughly 100 sharks inhabiting the most popular dive sites in the area were each worth $179,000 annually to the local tourism industry, giving each shark an approximate lifetime value of $1.9 million. Worldwide, established shark-related diving operations can be found in at least 83 locations in 29 different countries. However, shark populations are declining at an alarming rate. Approximately 30 percent of shark species are threatened or nearly threatened with extinction, and the status of another roughly 50 percent is unclear due to insufficient data. Intense commercial fishing is largely to blame for the decline, and shark finning, the practice of removing a shark’s fins and discarding the rest of the animal to die at sea, is particularly rampant. This practice is driven by demand for shark fin soup, a delicacy that creates a lucrative market for shark fins. Because most sharks reproduce late in life and bear few offspring, scientists fear that some severely depleted populations may take hundreds of years to rebuild. This frightening prospect has compelled conservationists, scientists and government officials to push for greater shark protection. Recently,   and the Maldives have created shark sanctuaries by prohibiting commercial shark fishing in their countries’ exclusive economic zones.   also implemented a shark fishing moratorium, and   has now instituted a retention ban aimed at banning the possession of shark fins in state waters.   recently signed a shark and ray sanctuary into law. Lastly, in  , we have worked with our partners to get better protection for sharks through wide-reaching media and education campaigns. These initiatives will educate communities about their vested stake in preserving healthy shark populations to support the coral reef ecosystems that provide them with food, income and coastal protection.

Nowhere is this more true than on coral reefs, where a worldwide crisis is underway that has scientists and environmentalists asking a chilling question: how can we save coral reefs? At the Coral Reef Alliance, we believe that the natural process of adaptation can help save coral reefs. A   co-authored by CORAL staff and others, argues that adaptation will occur faster and have a better chance of succeeding if nature has many options with which to work. Options take the form of different species, individuals and genes and work like tickets in a lottery: most are not winners, but a few have just the right combinations to succeed. This article outlines an innovative approach and practical advice about how we can facilitate the processes of adaptation through the creation of adaptation networks, which maximize the probability of nature finding the winners. Adaptation networks have three attributes. They are: Adaptation networks serve as experimental testing grounds where billions of evolutionary match/mismatch tests (lottery draws) allow nature to pick winning combinations of genes and species. As our climate continues to change, these winners are vital to creating the ecosystems of the future in which humans and other species can continue to thrive. This approach to the creation of adaptation networks is a direct contrast to many contemporary conservation strategies that are based on forecasting which species will succeed under future environmental conditions. However, it is notoriously difficult to predict the effects of climate change on local environments accurately, and even harder to predict which organisms will succeed in these anticipated conditions. In the face of this uncertainty, it is unwise only to protect those species or areas that we think will survive in the oceans of the future. It is for this reason that adaptation networks could prove to be the best method to save coral reefs by protecting diversity and allowing the natural selection process to happen."

Located at the base of Mount Agung in the North East of Bali, Tulamben is one of the driest places on the island.

In honor of Earth Day, you can do your part: consider making a lifetime pledge to not litter and to help clean up trash when you see it. If you’re out for a walk at your local park, pick up that soda bottle and recycle it instead of leaving it for the next person. If you’re on vacation and snorkeling or diving on the local reef, keep your trash in a safe place and properly dispose of it when you return to the shore.

Adaptive Reefscapes should be as big as possible to reduce problems caused by large disturbances; a small Reefscape might be at risk from one major hurricane or bleaching event, but a large Reefscape is more likely to include some reefs that are unharmed and can be sources of future recolonization. Large Reefscapes are also more likely to include lots of different kinds of reefs and corals. This diversity, which we described previously, acts as options for the future. Conversely, if a Reefscape is too big, baby corals will not be able to spread readily from one reef to the next, slowing down the potential for adaptation.

Coral Reefs are very important because they protect the coastline from damaging storms and waves and they provide a habitat, shelter, and protection for thousands of marine organisms.

Currently, coral reefs are suffering great losses due to local threats, such as overfishing and unsustainable tourism, and global threats, such as rising ocean temperatures. As the executive director of a coral conservation nonprofit, I must ask myself how we can save coral reefs. Fortunately, we have an answer found with the corals themselves. Today there is a growing scientific evidence that corals can adapt to environmental changes. In fact, corals have been adapting for hundreds of millions of years. We can see evidence of coral adaptation everywhere on coral reefs. For example, scientists are discovering corals that are thriving in harsh conditions, like the unusually warm waters in lagoons in American Samoa. These special corals are defying the assumption that corals are fragile and headed for extinction. To save coral reefs, we must reduce local-level threats to reefs that help these special corals survive, grow and spread their special genes to future generations and withstand global threats – this is the process of coral adaptation. Seizing upon this revelation, CORAL is pioneering an innovate conservation blueprint called   – healthy networks of  ,   and   reefs. Adaptive Reefscapes include many types of reefs, habitats, species and genes. We safeguard DIVERSITY to preserve options for an unpredictable future. Rapid adaptation requires a CONNECTED network of healthy reefs such as Marine Protected Areas or Locally Managed Marine Areas to facilitate the spread of baby corals to different reefs and repopulate degraded reefs. Small networks of reefs are vulnerable to a single disturbance such as a storm or a disease outbreak. Connecting LARGE networks of reefs protects reefscapes against losing everything all at once. With our many partners, we are creating an Adaptive Reefscape along the Mesoamerican reef region, which spans the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. Already, we have been able to identify key reefs where we can give corals a leg up by reducing coastal pollution and improving fisheries management. We are also developing a mathematical model to pinpoint additional reefs that we should protect to help corals adapt. Our goal is to launch similar Adaptive Reefscapes in three other key coral reef regions around the world. Creating successful reefscapes in these regions will provide a proven blueprint for global coral reef conservation."

Having held a long fascination with sharks, Justin likes to equate them to the cops of the marine world due to their ability to help maintain the delicate balance between fish populations in marine ecosystems. He also enjoys the Hawaiian triggerfish ( ) simply because of its “really cool” name in native Hawaiian: humuhumunukunukuāpuaʻa; I mean, who can blame him! However, Justin worries about the future of our underwater havens. As Justin likes to put it, “coral reefs support all the life in the ocean in that all of the lives are interconnected in the marine ecosystem. Marine animals depend on coral reefs for protection and habitat. They are important to the ocean ecosystem. Also, coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and waves. Coral reefs are dying because of human carelessness and ignorance. Climate change, dynamite fishing and pollution all disturb the ecosystem — that can’t be good for the animals that live in the ocean or for the human species as a whole.” As an environmentalist, Justin cares about the positive and negative effects we have on our planet. He wants “to keep nature safe, and coral reefs are such an important part of the ocean.” The future of coral reefs is bright due to young champions like Justin who one day will don the mantle of coral preservation to save coral reefs."

        "content": "  The   in American Samoa is a special place. It’s a place where turtles lay their eggs on the beach, sharks swim around the bay and young corals grow everywhere. Not too long ago, however, the local coral reefs had been devastated by overharvesting and pollution. What changed to allow these reefs to recover? Tisa Fa’amuli, a native Samoan and self-described eco-warrior, decided to take it upon herself to restore the reef. She created a   to raise awareness about the Sanctuary and expressed her mission to CORAL Board Member Michael Bennett, who recently visited American Samoa and had the opportunity to document and share Tisa’s inspiring story. Tisa Fa’amuli’s story starts on the island of Tutuila where she was born and raised by her father Afenoa. Being the second of twelve children, Tisa learned many lessons from her father about working hard, providing for a large family and respecting the land. “This is where I learned about conservation,” Tisa notes. While growing up in the 50s, “these words were not used: conservation, sustainable. We lived it. We didn’t identify them. It was a way of life. It was a way for survival.” These lessons stuck with Tisa and shaped her future in unexpected ways. At the age of 34, after numerous years living away from home, Tisa moved back to her hometown of Alega from San Diego, California and didn’t recognize her childhood village. The fish in the bay were gone, the coral reefs were dead and the beaches were covered in debris. Tisa soon realized “that this village needs to be restored.” To help kick start restoration efforts, Tisa and her two sons started clean-ups along the coastal highway and beaches. Local community members thought she had lost her mind “because nobody cleans the highway; it’s the government’s job.” It was around this same time in 1980 that Tisa decided to start protecting a small strip of beach and coastal waters near her property, creating a self-declared marine sanctuary. Her goal was to restore the local marine life back to what it was when she was a child. She created her own no-take zone that was largely enforced by word of mouth and a variety of self-enforcement methods. She and her partner, Candy Mann, performed night patrols looking for poachers and used flash lights to scare them away, sometimes even getting in a kayak to chase them off of the protected area. In 1989, inspired by these experiences, Tisa started Tisa’s Barefoot Bar & Eco-Resort, using the profits to help fund her conservation efforts. Over the years, Tisa learned to use education and outreach as an effective tool for protecting her special sanctuary and gaining local buy-in. By speaking with local fishermen and villagers, she could convince them about the importance of caring for the marine environment, not catching baby fish, or not catching entire schools of fish. “I would just engage them in conservation and have them really feel my heart as a sincere way (not) to come and destroy or kill the reef, walk on the reef (or) try to get the fish” explains Tisa. “I put it in forms of education that they understand.” In order to ensure that these life lessons get passed down to future generations, Tisa has started training her grandchildren on how to protect the reef and has shared stories from her father about always caring for the land and taking pride in your roots. Thanks to Tisa’s time and effort, in 2013, the local government officially created a no-take Marine Protected Area (MPA) with a stated goal to “educate other communities how to start Marine Sanctuaries to protect our beautiful islands and education on indigenous fishing seasons and methods.” Tisa’s future goal is to have a place that is open to local people to come, learn and enjoy marine life in perpetuity, and, through her hard work and dedication, she has created just that opportunity."

Every two years, the  , an international alliance of over 60 organizations including CORAL, publishes a Report Card on the status and trends of reef health in the MAR using data collected* from over 300 sites across 1000 kilometers and four countries. HRI Report Cards give sites a reef health score, analyze changes over time, and propose actions to improve reef health and enable reefs to endure and thrive.   The recently released   tells us that overall reef health in the MAR has improved from an initial reef health index of Poor (2.3) in 2006 to Fair (2.8) this year, using a scale that ranges from Critical (1) to Very Good (5). The positive trend is a result of increases in fish biomass, which are attributable to stronger fisheries management and a significant increase in Marine Protected Areas, which now cover 57% of the MAR. Of the four countries that comprise the MAR – Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico –   received the highest score for reef health (3.0). In addition to having relatively high coral cover, Honduras has the highest biomass of herbivorous fishes (like parrotfish and surgeonfish), which feed intensively on macroalgae, a kind of fleshy algae that can grow unchecked in polluted waters and outcompete corals for space. We are pleased to report that the reefs in West End, Roatán, where CORAL has close to 15 years of engagement, are among the healthiest reefs in the entire region. In line with the 2018 Report Card’s Call to Action for Honduras, CORAL is addressing both   through our   and   Initiatives. HRI commenced the   in a big way with simultaneous launches of the 2018 Report Card in Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico. The events were well attended by partners and other allies, and received significant local and international media coverage. CORAL was proud to participate in Honduras’ Report Card launch on January 10  in Tegucigalpa. The 2018 Report Card also marks a decade of data collection by HRI, providing an important temporal perspective on trends in reef health. Despite the fact that corals worldwide were hard-hit by mass bleaching over the last few years, 10 years of reef monitoring by HRI tells us that things are looking up in the MAR. With the 2018 Report Card launch marking a decade of collaboration and conservation, the good news for the Mesoamerican region’s reefs, and the kick-off of the third International Year of the Reef, 2018 is off to a great start!    "

        "content": "Bali’s Mount Agung erupted again on February 13, 2018, just days after Indonesian authorities lowered the alert status from Hazardous (Level IV) to Standby (Level III). The eruption lasted just over two minutes and spewed ash and smoke 1.5 kilometers into the air. Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported that there was no damage, community activities are running normally and flights to Bali continue to operate despite the eruption. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) continues to monitor and support our community partners in the affected villages of Tulamben, Amed and Jemeluk. Mount Agung began exhibiting pre-eruption seismic activity in September, 2017, and authorities evacuated communities within a 12-kilometer radius of the volcano. When two eruptions occurred in late November nearly 140,000 people had been evacuated, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Mount Agung erupted again several times but with less intensity, and authorities lowered the alert status to Level III on February 11, 2018. But two days later the volcano erupted again and reignited fear and anxiety in nearby communities. Concerns are especially heightened as older generations vividly remember the devastating effects of the 1963 eruption, which claimed the lives of approximately 1,600 people, destroyed dozens of villages and lasted for almost a year. I Made Jaya Ratha, CORAL’s Indonesia Program Coordinator, reports that most evacuees from Tulamben have returned home, and reef monitoring and trash cleanup programs have resumed. Challenging conditions such as lack of food and crowded sleeping areas have been contributing factors in the decision to return home to an at-risk area. But life at home is not easy, says Ratha. Tourism is the primary economic driver for many coastal communities in the region, and a scuba diving moratorium in Tulamben closed resorts in October and November. The tourism industry is also struggling in the nearby villages of Amed and Jemeluk, after visitors canceled bookings in light of travel warnings. Meanwhile, prices of fresh produce have increased as ash falls on fields that lack farmers to tend them. Despite these challenges, communities are coming together to rebuild their lives. CORAL staff brought fresh water, vegetables and ventilation masks to evacuated communities during the worst of the volcanic activity, and are working with villages to prioritize their needs. While the memory of the 1963 eruption still looms in their minds, community members are returning home, looking forward and hoping for a calmer future."

        "content": "Popularly known as staghorn corals, due to the similarity of their structure with that of the antler of the mammal in question, the   corals are one of the most important corals in the region of the Mesoamerican Reef System (MAR) because they are reef builders. Thanks to their strong substrate and their peculiar shape,   offer shelter to juvenile fish and protect coastal communities against strong waves. However, there are relatively few places in the Caribbean that still hold large extensions of this coral species. One of these is the Cordelia Banks Wildlife Site, located on the southwest of Roatan Island, Honduras, where the number of   individuals is impressive, says marine biologist  , coordinator of the Smithsonian Institution’s  . “The number of these corals in that bank is surprising, especially after the massive die-off—due to an unknown agent—that in the 1980s reduced their presence in the Caribbean. Approximately 90 percent of them were lost. In addition, this population managed to recover from a bleaching event that affected the corals of Roatán about four years ago and continues to survive, despite being located very close to cruise ship docks and the amount of pollutants it receives from nearby populations,” adds Canty. And it is precisely these signs of vitality and resilience of the   of Cordelia Banks that make it a site of interest not only for tourism but also for science, as a source of propagules (coral larvae) with the potential to repopulate reef communities in the MAR region. For this reason, the organization   (CORAL) sponsored the study of the genetic diversity of the corals of the Cordelia Banks, that is, the total number of different genetic characteristics among them. Such differences are a basic component of biodiversity, and the greater the genetic diversity, the more likely a species is to survive environmental changes. To carry out this research, CORAL contacted Steven Canty, who together with fellow scientists Graeme Fox, Jennifer K. Rowntree, and Richard F. Preziosi, produced the study entitled:   It was published in February 2021 by the journal  (the article is open access) The summary of the document states that: “Amongst the global decline of coral reefs, hope spots such as Cordelia Banks in Honduras have been identified. This site contains dense, remnant thickets of the endangered species  , which local managers and conservation organizations view as a potential source population for coral restoration projects.” According to Canty, CORAL, in addition to being interested in the knowledge of this important coral bank for the MAR region, wanted to have solid scientific evidence to update their management plan. However, how do you manage corals if their biology is unknown? For this reason, he and his colleagues conducted the previously mentioned study. Cordelia Banks is a protected area formed by four coral banks where   sharks and a spawning site for snappers and groupers are present. Samples for the study were taken in 2014 from three of those banks: Big Cay; Cordelia Shoal and Smith Bank. Biologist Mayra Núñez Vallecillo was one of the researchers who participated in the collection of samples. Mayra describes Cordelia Banks as a paradise under the sea, and indicates that having participated in this field work helped her expand her knowledge of coral reefs. According to the biologist, research of this type is important to generate adequate management and conservation tools for the protection of marine ecosystems, on which not only plants and animals, but also people depend upon for their survival. Canty indicates that an important survival mechanism of   fragmentation and the fragmented pieces are carried by the currents, therefore, they can settle in places near or far from the specimen from which they were detached. This situation makes it difficult to determine whether a new coral comes from the same individual, a clone (asexual reproduction), or is the product of the union of two different ones (sexual reproduction). If the specimens come from the same individual, their use to restore degraded coral areas would not be the best option, because since the fragments have the same genetic material, they would all be susceptible to the same diseases or disorders caused by stressful situations, Canty explains. In Cordelia Banks, where the large numbers of colonies of this species cover about 63,440 square meters, “it was possible to identify a low genetic diversity in the three banks of the protected area and the genetic similarity of the colonies ranged from 91.3 to 95.8 percent between the banks. ‘Clonality’ rates were approximately 30 percent across all three banks. And each genotype identified was unique to each bank,” the study notes. “Subtle differences were demonstrated within and among the banks, that is, not all of them come from the same individual. The presence of multiple genotypes suggests   colonies from these banks could be used to maintain and enhance genetic diversity in restoration projects.” For this reason, the study indicates that “management of hope spots, such as Cordelia Banks, and the incorporation of genetic information into restoration projects to ensure genetic diversity within out-planted populations, will be critical in the ongoing challenge of conserving and preserving coral reefs.” Canty explains that he is happy with these findings from the study, because there is more genetic diversity in the   of Cordelia Banks than they thought, and it motivates him to conduct a similar study with mangroves and seagrasses because it is important to know the existing connectivity between small populations in these ecosystems and in the entire MAR region. The data obtained, as well as those produced by the aforementioned research, are used to develop management plans based on scientific evidence. Furthermore, they contribute to identifying the potential for adaptation of ecosystems, so that coastal communities know how to lead this management. For a conservation strategy to be successful, it is necessary to involve the people living in the area, says the biologist. Canty’s recommendation, for those who lead coral restoration projects with fragments of the Cordelia Banks corals, is that they keep a genetic diary, so that they know which fragment and from which colony they used to transplant in a certain site. , an environmental engineer and CORAL’s Regional Program Director in the MAR, explains that the efforts of her work are focused on actions that will help the Mesoamerican Reef thrive. For example, it is imperative that the inflow and negative impact of wastewater on Cordelia Banks be reduced, as the quality of the surrounding water must be optimal in order for it to remain healthy. The conservation work at Cordelia Banks, which according to data from the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative has 72.23 percent live coral (the average in the MAR is 19 percent), also aims to honor its declaration by the Honduran government as a Site of Importance for Wildlife. This declaration, achieved in 2012, took seven years of work from various governmental and non-governmental organizations, among them CORAL. For that reason, the data produced by the study by Canty and colleagues will be useful for teaming up with the other organizations involved to update the site’s Management Plan and to determine and guide the actions to be implemented, concludes Jenny."

        "content": "The CORAL family came together last week in a unique way. A few months ago, the Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS) reached out to Jaya Ratha, our program coordinator in Bali, to help organize the arrival of the Hōkūleʻa in Indonesia. The Hōkūleʻa is a double-hulled standing canoe traveling around the world using traditional navigation methods. Their voyage, called  , or to care for the Earth, is an effort to bring together global partners to protect our Earth and our oceans. “One of the things that was interesting to me was that Hawaiʻi and Bali have a lot of similarities in terms of culture,” said Ratha. Bali and Hawaiʻi were designated as sister states back in 2014, as they are both hugely popular tourism destinations and they share similar histories. This amazing around-the-world voyage brought the Hawaiian culture and heritage to Indonesia—making these two diverse islands feel incredibly connected. As a complete coincidence, CORAL’s Program Coordinator in Maui, Chana Ane, remembers going on one of the early launchings of the Hōkūleʻa and her family is extremely involved in PVS. During its voyage, the Hōkūleʻa stops in various ports to raise awareness. The PVS brings in teachers from Hawaiʻi to join the crew and bring traditional knowledge and contemporary ideas to local communities. The Hōkūleʻa arrived in Bali on August 1, after leaving Australia, and we, along with Reef Check Indonesia, Lensa Masyarakat Nusantara (LMN) and CI Indonesia, helped connect them with various communities in Bali, including the Amed community in the Karangesem regency. The community in Amed has worked hard to protect its ocean environment, which is now officially recognized as a locally managed marine area. The arrival of the PVS helped raise awareness about their work. In addition, it helped connect the community with local government officials to highlight the conservation initiatives underway. While in Amed, the Hōkūleʻa team snorkeled with a community guide and saw the effects of the various threats harming coral reefs. These threats were not unknown to them, as many mirror the same ones affecting Hawaiʻi’s coral reefs. They also learned about traditional salt making, and heard from a small group of people trying to protect and maintain Balinese antiquity. The group shared stories and spoke about traditions and their different cultures. What they learned is that they face similar challenges. Tourism is increasing in Bali. Particularly, in the small town of Amed where people are struggling to protect their values and beliefs. The PVS team from Hawaii was empathetic. They passed along insight on how their state has coped with the influx of tourists, and how they’ve worked to protect their environment, heritage, and cultural identity. Our international teams are spread out all over the world, but we are all connected in various ways. The coming together of the Hawaiian and Balinese cultures made that very evident this week. Like the PVS, we believe in global partnerships. After all, we won’t be able to protect coral reefs without them. Read more about the Hōkūleʻa’s visit to Bali on  , updated regularly.  "

But imagine going back to school and learning about real local issues, and then learning real life skills and using them to solve actual problems in your community. That’s what students in Mr. Ryan Duffy’s class went back to this year. Mr. Duffy teaches sixth through eighth grade math and science at ROOTS school in Haiku on Maui, Hawaiʻi. Last October he came to CORAL’s Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) workshop and learned how to teach his students about the importance of watersheds in a way that’s fun and exciting. He’s applying those skills, and his students are completely engaged! Soon after the workshop, Mr. Duffy’s students started designing a system to capture rain water off their school’s rooftop. They collected data to determine the average rainfall for their region, and measured the surface area of the school’s roof. They compiled this information to calculate the amount of rain they could catch and researched various rain water harvesting systems. They even built a first flush diverter to prevent the polluted water from the beginning of a rain event—and all the debris it brings off the roof—from entering the water catchment tanks. By spring, the students had completed their data collection and calculations and were ready to install their water catchment tanks. Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company donated two 500-gallon water catchment tanks, and CORAL’s Program Manager, Wes Crile, and Mr. Duffy helped install them.  The school is now able to divert about 1,000 gallons of rainwater from entering the ocean at nearby Hoʻokipa Beach each time it rains. Hoʻokipa isn’t too far from the world-famous surf spot, Jaws, and it’s a popular place for windsurfing and kite surfing. Preventing rainwater from entering the ocean there not only helps protect human health, but also helps protect coral reefs. The students will continue the project this year by measuring the rainwater catchment system and its impacts. They will also start monitoring water quality at Hoʻokipa beach and learn about the impacts that sediment and rainwater runoff have on the coral reefs. Soon they’ll start to see how their school project fits into the health of the entire watershed."

        "content": "You’ve probably heard about it in the news. You may even remember living through it in the early 80s and 90s. El Niño is here. It’s already impacting the Pacific Ocean and this August, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) saw variances in sea surface temperatures near or greater than 2.0 degrees Celsius. El Niño refers to warming waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Those warmer waters spread to the east, bringing with them a drastic change in weather patterns. Scientists predict that this year’s El Niño is extreme and may last through the spring of 2016. That means trouble for coral reefs. In fact, NOAA recently announced that “bleaching due to heat stress is expected to impact approximately 38 percent of the world’s coral reefs—and almost 95% of those in U.S. waters.” When water temperatures grow too warm, corals become stressed and oust the tiny algae that live in their tissues, called zooxanthellae. Corals and zooxanthellae have a mutually beneficial relationship that can be disrupted by changing temperatures. Without zooxanthellae, corals lose an important food source which significantly limits their ability to grow. Zooxanthellae are also responsible for giving corals their brilliant and vibrant colors—without them, corals bleach and turn a skeletal white color. Coral bleaching isn’t necessarily the same thing as corals dying. Corals can survive bleaching events, but their survival is contingent on the how warm the water gets and how long the warm period lasts. They will, however, have a harder time recovering if they are already struggling or unhealthy. If there’s a back-to-back series of warm water events, and if corals are already stressed from overfishing and pollution, mortality rates can skyrocket. Given the local threats reefs face in many places, we can expect high coral mortality especially if this year’s El Niño is as strong as scientists predict. We’re disappointed to report that we’ve already seen coral bleaching in Hawai‘i and elsewhere in the Pacific. The warm waters of an El Niño are also associated with an increase in the number of tropical cyclones. These weather events can cause a lot of physical destruction to a reef. If corals bleach, they have a hard time recovering—their growth is curtailed without their partner, zooxanthellae. The combination of increased water temperatures and storm activity can be a “double whammy” for coral reefs. El Niño is a natural phenomenon and we can’t stop it. When you add an El Niño to an already stressed system its effects are more severe. So what can you do about it? You can reduce your emissions and advocate on behalf of clean energy. When you’re out diving you can report bleached corals to local reef managers or to ReefBase (www.ReefBase.org). You can also help us do what we do best—unite communities to reduce local threats. If reefs are healthy, with clean water and an abundant amount of fish life, we can expect the corals to come back later. If we combine our efforts across the globe we can help give corals a fighting chance at surviving these environmental changes."

        "content": "Coral reefs are a hot topic these days. They’re all over the news—coral bleaching, constructing islands on top of reefs, and sunscreen pollution. Even the   has been running a series of articles on coral reefs. I’ve worked with corals for more than 10 years and I can’t remember a time when they’ve ever been so mainstream and popular. But here’s the problem: it’s all doom and gloom. All of the news that’s coming out is bad news. Where’s the optimism? Where’s the hope? Where are the success stories? That’s one of the things I love about CORAL. We know we CAN save coral reefs, and with the right amount of support, we WILL. And that’s why I enjoyed my most recent trip to Bali, Indonesia. I strategically aligned my trip so I could attend the first-ever Buleleng Bali Dive Festival, which was held in Pemuteran. Some of you may remember hearing about it at our 2014 Gala, when the Indonesian Minister of Fisheries and Affairs announced the festival for the first time. The festival was a huge success—complete with a parade, traditional ceremony, educational talks, and of course, unforgettable diving. But, what really hit home on this trip was seeing how motivated and impassioned the local communities are about protecting coral reefs. It was the success stories that really stood out. Take Nyoman Suastika for example. Nyoman lives in the community of Tulamben, a small fishing village in Bali known for one of the best wreck dives in the world. Divers and dive operators consistently dive in this area, but the increase in tourism was damaging the coral and harming the ecosystem. Dive operators from out of the area accompanied visiting divers, which meant a lot of the benefits of tourism weren’t staying within the community. As a result, the community didn’t have the resources to protect the environment. Nyoman took notice and started talking to his community about the issue. His community had a no-take conservation area, and he attended trainings to learn how to turn it into a formalized Marine Protected Area—a conservation area that is formally recognized and supported by the national government—and to ensure it is effectively managed. With the help of CORAL and our local partners, Nyoman organized his community to take action. Together, they established a local group of dive guides called Organisasi Dive Guide Tulamben. Dive operators from outside of Tulamben now call on the local group to lead their trips, instead of sending in guides from outside the area. As a result, more of the tourism fees stay within the community. This enables the community to oversee and manage how their local coral reefs are utilized. CORAL is helping Nyoman and his community protect and manage the local coral reefs in a variety of ways. This includes: Nyoman is an incredibly humble and down-to-earth individual. His motivating driver is simple: his goal is to improve Tulamben’s reefs. He envisions a future where his community understands that conservation is beneficial and leads to a healthy reef and community. He envisions a community that prioritizes sustainable land-use practices. And he envisions an ocean without trash and with an abundant array of fish and wildlife. There is so much incredible work happening in Bali, and around the world, to protect coral reefs. THIS is the kind of ground-up work that we should see in the news. I hope Nyoman’s story inspires you as much as it inspires me. Together we CAN and we WILL continue to protect coral reefs for generations to come."

        "content": "On the northern coast of Honduras, just a few miles west of Tela through lush tropical forests, sits Laguna de los Micos. The Laguna is a treasure trove of biodiversity, surrounded by mangroves and separated from the Caribbean Sea by only a few feet of sand. It’s one of the area’s most important coral reef habitats, and serves as a respite, home and nursery for hundreds of coral reef fish. The Laguna has always been an important area for local communities, providing subsistence and livelihoods. But in recent years, the fishermen weren’t catching as much. Fish populations seemed to be disappearing. Laguna de los Micos is part of the Parque Nacional Jeannette Kawas. The area is protected and has a management plan that includes fishing regulations. For example, boats cannot carry more than 600 meters of net, and the mesh size must be at least three inches. In some waterways you can only fish with hook and line, and spear guns or dynamite are prohibited. The regulations are numerous—but there was never enough money or local participation to enforce them. This year, CORAL and many of its local partners, helped create a patrol program for the lagoon. The Institutional Committee of Fisheries and Marine Resources in Tela*—a conglomeration of government organizations and local NGOs—provides the resources and man-power. CORAL provides the funding and training. A typical patrol may include a car from PROLANSATE, a boat from DIGEPESCA and field techniques from each organization. It’s a true example of collaboration, and it works. Fishermen now report seeing mackerel over 30cm in length, and many regularly catch jacks that weigh more than 10 pounds. The fishermen support the patrols, and are grateful that they are conducted by a local committee. They say it keeps the process honest and transparent. This collaboration is an exemplary model. It’s proof that great things happen when we work together. Conservation isn’t just about protecting the environment, it’s also about working alongside the communities that rely on that environment. And when governments, communities and NGOs partner together, environments thrive."

        "content": "It’s 6:45 a.m. when Paola Urrutia arrives at Tela Bay. She makes her way down to the water, finds the spot where the fishermen will disembark after their morning catch, and sits down to wait. On the northern Caribbean coast of Honduras, Tela Bay sits at the bottom of a gently sloping tropical forest, marked by beautiful white sand beaches and sparkling turquoise water. It’s home to some of the healthiest coral reefs in all of Central America—scientists estimate that the bay averages about 70% live coral cover, the highest in the Mesoamerican Reef system. When she sees the first boat begin to approach, Urrutia pulls out her equipment and marks down the time of arrival. She approaches the vessel and requests permission to collect data from their catch. The fishermen are used to her presence by now and her research has become a standard part of their disembarkation routine. She analyzes the fish they caught, carefully documenting all of her measurements. Urrutia was hired as CORAL’s first community scientist in Honduras in 2015. Today she’s one of three community scientists that CORAL employs in the country to gain a better understanding of what is happening to local fisheries. CORAL’s community scientists live in or near the communities where they work, which helps them build relationships and gain trust. They tend to be women, most often from minority groups, who have struggled to find adequate employment and face social and economic vulnerability. Though several of them come from fishing backgrounds with relatives and family members who fish, this is their first foray into science and research. CORAL Program Coordinators train them on the basic science of fisheries and how to appropriately and accurately collect and monitor data. “I have changed a lot thanks to CORAL,” says Greissi Lizeth Villatoro, who began working as a community scientist in early 2019. She works in Laguna de los Micos, a popular fish nursery in the lagoon that feeds Tela Bay. “I have learned many things that I did not know, and taking the data has also helped me a lot.” The program not only provides the scientists with paid employment and much-needed economic stability, but CORAL’s Program Coordinators also encourage the women to work toward personal goals and pursue their education as a way of investing in themselves and their families. Urrutia herself left her role as a community scientist in 2016 to go back to school at the urging of CORAL’s then Program Coordinator. Now that she has graduated, she has come back to CORAL, and has taken on more duties. She’s now supervising the maintenance and data collection of CORAL’s experimental aquaculture project in Tela—a project designed to create an economic alternative for fishermen—in addition to working as a community scientist in Tela Bay. Through their relationships, the women have created a network of fishermen that help support science and understand the importance of rules and regulations. They’ve become a regular presence at community meetings, and report back on their findings to help fishermen understand what is happening underwater. “The most important impact that I’ve noticed is that now people have more respect for closed seasons,” says Urrutia. “Before, 100% of fishermen went out to fish during the closed season, now only between 10-20% are going to fish illegally.” Urrutia has also noticed an increase in fishermen who talk openly about complying with regulations—they chat with each other about following regulations and avoiding damaging practices like anchoring on the reef. Practices that protect the environment are becoming more commonplace. Villatoro has also seen changes among the crabbing community in the lagoon near Tela. “Through the data collection, the crabbers have been learning the appropriate size of crabs to capture,” says Villatoro. “The fishermen’s company has stopped buying small crabs, and several fishermen have stopped using illegal nets where the mesh size is less than three inches.” This change in behavior is a direct result of the relationships and trust the community scientists have built within their communities. They have gained a reputation as being allies, and fishermen see them as a key component to decision making and managing their resource. “In the community where I come from, the work of a community scientist is seen as a means to improve fishing and to find out how the resource is doing,” says Ana Bessy Valdez. She joined the CORAL team in July 2019 and was the first community scientist to start monitoring in Trujillo Bay, the southern border of the Mesoamerican Reef system. “Fishermen are aware that data collection is to improve fishing and they want to know what alternatives they have for bad seasons.” Though not all of the fishermen that Valdez meets choose to provide her with data, the majority enjoy collaborating. Back in Tela, Urrutia casually chats with the fishermen while she takes her measurements. She asks them about their fishing location, depth, travel time, and expenses. The fishermen know Urrutia by now, and they trust her. They tell her who is still out on the water, and when and where they will likely land. She packs up her equipment, and relocates down the beach so she can be ready for the next arrival. When the last boat arrives at 10:00 a.m., she takes her last measurements, and bids her fishing friends farewell. She’ll be back tomorrow, same time, same place."

Throughout my time here, that initial impression has held steady: our staff works tirelessly every single day to support the local communities that depend on coral reefs, and together with our partners, they move mountains to ensure coral reefs have what they need to not only survive, but thrive. And our supporters remain steadfast in their commitment to protecting coral reefs for generations to come.  That is why I am full of both sadness and gratitude as I write to inform you I have decided to step away from my role as CORAL’s Executive Director. CORAL is a remarkable organization, and one that I will always hold dear to my heart. I am grateful that this position has allowed me to explore nonprofit administration and management, which has  led me to realize that my passion lies in conducting the direct science and conservation work that makes CORAL thrive. It has been an absolute honor to witness how CORAL has evolved over the last decade. We have grown to become a leader in a ground-breaking conservation movement that uses evolution to rescue reefs from climate change. We continue to partner with communities to protect coral reefs, but we now focus on directly addressing the biggest threats to reefs, like poor water quality and overfishing, and we do it in a way that allows coral reefs to adapt to climate change. And most recently, when the world was rocked by a global pandemic, we pivoted to ensure our partners could continue their reef-saving work amidst their unprecedented economic losses.  The CORAL Board of Directors has launched a   for a new Executive Director to assume responsibility when I depart in early June.

Thank you for all of your support over these last 10 years. I will miss this tremendous organization and community dearly, though I look forward to our paths crossing in a new way as we all continue to fight for coral reefs.  Thank you for your ongoing commitment to CORAL, and for making my time here so memorable.  With heartfelt appreciation, Madhavi Colton, Ph.D."

Nearly $375 billion in services comes from coral reefs alone each year. As a global community, we simply cannot afford to lose our coral reefs.  Today’s ruling is an ecocide—an unlawful act that was committed knowing that there will be widespread damage to the environment. The decision by the partisan and politicized Supreme Court to ignore science and instead rule in favor of corporate revenue puts us all at risk. Without clear action from our nation’s leaders, the lifesaving measures we need to curb emissions and slow the rate of climate change are out of reach.  In January, a report by the International Panel on Climate Change showed that if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half by 2030, we can still limit global warming to 2.7°F. The report showed that was an achievable target with appropriate government action. We are currently on track for 4.9°F of global warming, which from a coral reef standpoint alone, would create simultaneous ecological, humanitarian and economic crises.  Now is the time to take bigger, bolder action to address the climate crisis. We formally call on the leaders of this great nation to respond to today’s setback by passing legislation that curbs our greenhouse gas emissions with urgency and severity.  The science is clear: we must do more, and we must do it quickly.

The CALA was established in 2016 to recognize exemplary leadership in the field of climate adaptation and the protection of the nation’s vital natural resources and the people who depend on them in a changing world. “Climate change poses growing risks to our nation’s valuable fish and wildlife resources and the many people, businesses and communities that depend upon them,” stated Kelly Hepler, President of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and Secretary of the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks. “This year’s awardees have done outstanding work to help safeguard species, habitats, and communities in a changing world, and we are thrilled to recognize their efforts.” In 2015, CORAL launched a pioneering research project to understand what actions we can take today to help corals adapt to climate change. The results, published in Nature Climate Change, show that evolution can help rescue reefs from the effects of climate change. The research shows that when we conserve a diverse portfolio of coral reefs species, variable environmental conditions and significant connectivity, we enable the necessary conditions for nature’s survivors to spread their genes to future generations. The research also shows that adaptation is possible when local stressors are reduced across a network of sites. The result is an Adaptive Reefscape: a network of healthy reefs in which corals can adapt to climate change. A vitally important component of CORAL’s Adaptive Reefscape approach is that the reefs within the network are healthy. This means that reducing direct threats to reefs, particularly unsustainable fishing and land-based pollution, is essential. Well-managed reefs serve as sources of repopulation over the long-term, enabling coral survivors to rescue other reefs across a region. As a leader in coral conservation, CORAL works with communities and conservation professionals around the world to turn the peer-reviewed scientific results into action to give reefs the best chance to survive the coming decades. “We are beyond thrilled to have been selected as one of this year’s CALA Award winners for our work on Adaptive Reefscapes,” says Dr. Madhavi Colton, Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “Our research shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if they are kept healthy. It is an honor to have the backing of fish and wildlife agencies as we work with local communities and conservation professionals around the world to create the conditions in which corals can adapt.” This award is sponsored and guided by the Climate Adaptation Leadership Awards Steering Committee which is made up of representatives from the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and various Federal agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

        "category": null,
        "content": "Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and are home to 25 percent of all marine life though they occupy less than one percent of our oceans. There are sponges and corals of all shapes and sizes, hard and soft; tiny fishes like pygmy seahorses and big fishes like tiger sharks; there are anemones, nudibranchs and snails – the list goes on! Reefs are also diverse in types of habitats: fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls to name a few. Even a single species of coral is genetically diverse. But why does coral reef diversity matter in an era of global climate change? We all know the facts: corals face an uncertain future due to local threats, such as pollution and overfishing, and global threats, such as climate change and ocean acidification. But without the reef-building corals, like staghorn or elkhorn, there is no reef and no habitat for the myriad forms of life that call reefs home. If we are to have reefs in the future, these reef-builders will need to adapt. Fortunately, scientific research shows us that corals can adapt to changing climates. At the Coral Reef Alliance, we are developing a blueprint based on cutting-edge science that promotes coral adaptation within diverse, connected and large networks of healthy reefs called  . Our Adaptive Reefscape strategy draws ideas from evolutionary biology, economics and ecology. Evolutionary biology tells us that adaptation is more successful when there is a lot of diversity, like the diversity found within the many types of reefs, habitats, species and genes on coral reefs. In this case, more diversity means more evolutionary options for the future. Similarly, financial investors know that diversifying their portfolio can hedge bets against an uncertain future. In a diverse investment portfolio, some stocks behave independently from one another making the whole portfolio more stable. Researchers have discovered that diversity also affects ecological systems, which are less prone to boom and bust cycles when they are diverse. By combing these ideas in an Adaptive Reefscape that safeguards a diversity of habitats, species and genes, corals will be better able to adapt to global environmental changes and survive for centuries to come. We are first applying our Adaptive Reefscape strategy to the Mesoamerican Reef, which spans the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. In this region alone, there are over 60 species of coral. Two sites in this region are showing promising signs of adaptation. Corals in Tela Bay on the mainland of Honduras are thriving in murky waters. Off the coast of nearby Roatán, there are unusually lush stands of staghorn coral, which has declined almost everywhere else in the Caribbean. When corals surprise us by doing particularly well in unexpected places, it suggests that they may have already adapted to some of the threats that are facing coral reefs. Adaptive Reefscapes are designed to protect a diversity of reefs and corals so that special corals—like those in Tela and Roatán—can be the source of baby corals that will thrive in the future.

        "category": null,
        "content": "From raging wildfires to melting glaciers to coral bleaching—it is clear that there is pressing urgency to face the planet’s climate and ecological emergency. After postponing last year’s event due to COVID-19, the   (IUCN) decided to hold its quadrennial   from September 3 to 11, 2021 and commit to actions that will ensure a more sustainable future.  Members from more than 160 countries in government, science, civil society, and business sectors met in Marseille, France—along with many more participating virtually. One of those attendees was CORAL’s Hawaiʻi Regional Program Director  , representing the Hawaiʻi Conservation Alliance, an IUCN member organization and previous host to the 2016 World Conservation Congress.  We had a chance to catch up with Mejia after he returned from Marseille, getting a “behind-the-scenes” look at the main highlights and why there are reasons to be optimistic.  Previously, Mejia attended the 2016 Congress that took place in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, where a new membership category called the “Indigenous Peoples Organizations” was formed. Since its establishment, Mejia has noticed a significant increase of individuals from the Indigenous Peoples Organizations represented at IUCN.  “Indigenous voices are finally being elevated and listened to,” says Mejia, expressing the importance of taking a biocultural approach to conservation. “In the Pacific, and in Indigenous cultures in general, people are part of the equation. They aren’t separate from nature. As nature thrives, people thrive.”  At the Congress, Mejia proudly represented our partners in Hawaiʻi at the “Pacific Pavilion,” where members living in Oceania and the Pacific Islands spoke about topics relevant to their region. Mejia gave a presentation and shared the significance of “mauka to makai” conservation approaches in Hawaiʻi, or “ridge to reef.” He explained why taking care of land and sea is an important element to local cultures and island communities, like Hawaiʻi, and how communities are leading conservation efforts guided by Indigenous values and knowledge. Climate change was also an important topic at this year’s event. During the Congress, the Union made great progress by establishing the first official “Climate Change Commission” within IUCN—a motion widely led and supported by members of the Hawaiʻi Delegation, including Mejia.   According to  released by IUCN, “A climate crisis commission with a single focus to implement a unified plan to save the earth—providing a venue for those who wish to be part of the final stand—will protect future generations, Indigenous people and nature.” This new establishment will contribute to the worldwide effort to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the planet’s changing climate. This decision was a major victory for the Hawaiʻi delegation, as they feel firsthand the impacts of climate change to the Pacific. “Small islands are the canaries in the coal mine,” says Mejia. “They are the most vulnerable frontliners when it comes to climate change impacts.”  As a whole, Mejia felt this year’s Congress took an “all hands on deck” approach to conservation—with a strong sense of inclusion, collaboration, and dedication.  From   to presentations by youth conservationists to the involvement of the Marseille community, people from so many generations, backgrounds, and countries joined forces to seek nature-based solutions. Even French President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech, demonstrating his leadership in tackling climate change and expressing the importance of protecting nature—as our well-being depends on it.  Recent reports and studies all show that there is a dire need for real change. But Mejia is optimistic and sees this as an opportunity to come together and amplify meaningful conservation efforts. In the words of Harrison Ford, “We’ve got to get to work. We’ve got to make things happen—we’ve got to make it happen now.”"

        "content": "On October 5, 2021, the   released its latest  , detailing the status, trends, and predicted futures for the world’s coral reefs. After analyzing almost 2 million observations collected in 73 countries, one key message is abundantly clear—coral reefs are in trouble.  We’ve lost 14 percent of the world’s coral reefs in the last decade and according to Dr. Madhavi Colton, CORAL’s Executive Director, this is likely a conservative measurement. “It’s the equivalent of losing the entire Great Barrier Reef in 10 years,” she says.  Sadly, global findings show that many reefs are diminishing, instead of flourishing. This decline is mostly attributed to large scale   events, which first captured the attention of scientists in 1998 and have since become a regular occurrence. Climate change leads to warming ocean temperatures which can trigger bleaching and ultimately impact the health of coral reefs.    When corals die, algae can take over a reef and create a hostile environment that inhibits new coral growth. The GCRMN measured a 20 percent increase in algae living on coral reefs from 2010 to 2019, further demonstrating the severity of local reef threats and bleaching events.  But despite these upsetting statistics, the GCRMN also validated corals’ resilience and underscored the importance of acting quickly to save coral reefs. “The report isn’t an obituary—the report says there is still hope for coral reefs,” says Colton. “If you look at the data, there are times when corals have recovered.” According to the GCRMN, coral reefs have the ability to recover when the conditions permit. This can include minimizing water pollution or addressing overfishing, in order to create more optimal conditions for reefs to adapt to climate change. In fact, some reefs in the East Asian Seas region with high coral cover and diversity have already shown signs of natural resistance to increasing temperatures. Here at CORAL, we believe reefs can adapt to the effects of climate change if they are healthy. Over the last five years, we’ve been spearheading research to better understand what coral reefs need in order to adapt, and how to create those conditions in the real world. Ultimately, what it comes down to is working with local communities to keep corals healthy, and doing that in strategic places around the world.  That’s why we work with partners, governments, and members of local communities in the Mesoamerican region and Hawaiʻi to ensure cleaner, healthier reefs. Through these collaborations, we have trapped sediment before it reaches reefs in West Maui, supported community scientists working with fishers in Trujillo, monitored water quality in Roatán, and more.   The GCRMN report is out just in time for the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) and the UN Biodiversity Summit, when world leaders will join together to discuss future actions to address climate change, as well as ocean protection. “I hope this report becomes a large, loud alarm bell,” says Colton. “It provides the justification needed for world leaders to take a strong stance.”  In fact, the GCRMN report is already creating a buzz, with coverage appearing in major outlets like The New York Times and CNN International. And it’s important to continue spreading the word and educating the public about the significance of protecting coral reefs.  After all, coral reefs are strong and resilient, but they are also undeniably vulnerable—and if we want to save them, we need to take action now. "

        "content": "By Madhavi Colton, Ph.D.; Helen Fox, Ph.D.; Lisa McManus, Ph.D.; and Malin Pinsky, Ph.D. The trends are clear: around the world, coral reefs are dying. Just a few weeks ago we learned that we lost 14% of the world’s coral reefs in just 10 years, and that the primary driver of this decline is climate change. This obviously isn’t good news. Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine species despite occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor. They also provide food, income and storm protection to over one billion people. In total, they provide benefits worth over US$375 billion each year. If we lose coral reefs, it won’t just be a biodiversity crisis—it will also be a humanitarian and economic crisis.  As all eyes turn to the   this month, we have to ask: will this be the year we finally commit to saving these valuable ecosystems? Climate change is here, and it’s only going to get worse. But despite these dire reports, humanity has a critical window of time for action. And we know this because our research shows that we still have time to save coral reefs. We have spent the last five years of our careers as coral reef scientists investigating the best ways to protect coral reefs from the global changes coming their way, like warming ocean temperatures. We built sophisticated mathematical models to understand how and whether reefs can survive. Our results show that there is hope for coral reefs: they can adapt to cope with a warmer world, but only if we act quickly.  To give corals the best chance of adaptation, two things must happen: 1) we need to reduce local human impacts on reefs like overfishing and pollution; and 2) we must rapidly slow and then stop climate change.  Countless communities, nonprofit organizations and governments are doing their very best to reduce local stressors to reefs. They are improving water quality, reducing overfishing, and combating land-based pollution.  At the  , we have seen the community in West End, Roatán in Honduras galvanize their resources to get a wastewater treatment plant up and running. The result has been a 99% reduction in bacteria in nearshore waters, not only making the ocean cleaner for coral reefs, but also making it more sanitary for the people who swim and fish in those waters. In Hawai’i, over 100 community volunteers have come together to keep 25 tons of sediment off the coral reefs of West Maui by reforesting degraded landscapes with native plants.  The communities that depend on coral reefs the most are doing what they can to protect their livelihoods and their homes. And while these efforts are critically important, they will ultimately be in vain if our global leaders don’t take immediate action to reduce the amount of warming that our world is on track to experience.   We need to reduce emissions, and we need to do it now. This can only be accomplished through coordinated international efforts.  If we commit to reducing carbon emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, science indicates that corals can adapt to a warmer world. To achieve this requires immediate and dramatic global action. There is no time to waste. If COP26 in Glasgow results in real promises that lead to real change, then we still have time to avert the extinction of one of the world’s most important ecosystems.  But if we continue on our current emissions trajectory, it is going to be very difficult if not impossible for corals—and many other species—to adapt quickly enough. That’s why we, as coral reef scientists who care deeply about what’s at stake, join faith leaders, health professionals, community members and business stakeholders in calling on world leaders to set ambitious targets to lower emissions and translate that commitment to action. If we act now, there is still hope for coral reefs and the billion people who depend on them. But if we don’t, we’re looking at a much more difficult and treacherous road ahead.  Madhavi Colton, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance Helen Fox, Ph.D., Conservation Science Director of the Coral Reef Alliance Lisa McManus, Ph.D., Assistant Research Professor at the Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology at University of Hawai’i at Manoa Malin Pinsky, Ph.D., Associate Professor and Director of the Graduate Program in Ecology & Evolution at Rutgers University"

Antonella is a Honduran biologist born in the city of Tegucigalpa and will work with local communities on fisheries reform and management efforts along the North Coast and Tela. Antonella first became aware of the profound benefits coral reefs have on the sustainability of coastal communities while diving off the coast of Honduras in the Bay Islands. This new appreciation for reefs motivated her to earn a Ph.D. in marine socio-ecological systems from the University of Oviedo. Her multidisciplinary research background ranges from analyzing the management implications of larval dispersal to the use of perception research to assess the adaptive capacity of coastal communities. Through her studies and work experience with fishing communities in Europe and Latin America, she has become a firm believer in the need for bottom-up, holistic and adaptive conservation strategies. We are excited to have Antonella working in Honduras to protect the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, the Mesoamerican Reef.

This annual event, conceived as a heartfelt thank-you to our generous donors, took on a new dimension in light of recent events and became a profound benefit for a vital cause. As the sun set, guests gathered at the stunning Pacific Club to embark on an evening of enchanting music and camaraderie. The event kicked off with a delightful spread of pūpūs, featuring a medley of mouthwatering appetizers inspired by Hawaiian cuisine. Amidst the laughter and mingling, we took a moment to share a little about our work and the purpose behind Music on the Reef. The event was initially intended as an expression of our gratitude to our donors, but due to the devastating wildfires in Maui, it gained a new purpose. The wildfires in Maui served as a stark reminder of the challenges our beloved islands face due to climate change. In response, we launched the Community Resilience Fund, a testament to our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our natural treasures and the communities who rely on them. These underwater marvels, coral reefs, are the lifeblood of our oceans and a cornerstone of Hawaii’s vibrant ecosystem. The loss in Lahaina served as a wake-up call to many, including our organization. One of our program staff was directly impacted in a life-changing way, and at that moment, we knew we needed to be prepared for more major disasters as climate change ramps up. Enter the Community Resilience Fund, which we officially kicked off on September 14th at Music on the Reef. Major weather events, due to climate change, are realities we cannot ignore. It’s a menace that threatens not just our musical harmony but the very existence of the coral reefs that inspired this event. Coral reefs are the backbone of our marine ecosystems, nurturing a wealth of biodiversity and supporting our fisheries. Protecting them is not just an environmental imperative; it’s a duty we owe to future generations. In response to climate change, we are securing funds for coastal communities just like Lahaina. Through research, conservation initiatives, and community engagement, we are committed to ensuring the people who protect our underwater wonders endure for generations to come. With the crowd’s spirits lifted and hearts warmed, it was time for the main event—a concert that transported everyone to a world of musical enchantment. The stage was graced by a lineup of extraordinary musicians, featuring the incomparable Josh Nakazawa on cello and the legendary Jake Shimabukuro (ukulele), our CORAL ambassadors, alongside world class virtuosos–concertmaster for the Hawaiian Symphony Orchestra, Ignance Jang (violin), Shawn Conley (bass), Megan Conley (harp), Jasmine Nagano (piano), Natalie Mitchell (voice), Kevin Chang (voice), and Jackson Waldhoff (electric bass). All played with heartfelt intensity and artistry, which captivated everyone. The ensemble featured an array of instruments, from strings to keys, chilling vocals, and the soulful strumming of ukuleles. The synergy between these diverse sounds created a mesmerizing fusion of melodies that resonated with the very essence of Hawaii’s rich cultural tapestry. As the last note hung in the air and the crowd erupted in applause, it was evident that the evening had left a lasting impact. Beyond the musical celebration, Music on the Reef was a clarion call to action. What makes events like this even more remarkable is the unwavering support of the Hawaiian community. Time and again, we have witnessed resilience and determination when it comes to safeguarding our natural treasures. We are immensely grateful for their continued support, and it serves as a testament to our shared dedication to fighting for our coral reefs’ future. The second edition of Music on the Reef was a resounding success, both in terms of musical splendor and its impact on our collective consciousness. As we look ahead to future editions of this event, we do so with a renewed commitment to the cause and a profound sense of gratitude for everyone who joined us on this journey. To all our donors, supporters, and the entire Hawaii community, we say mahalo nui loa. Together, we will continue to harmonize for a sustainable future where our coral reefs thrive, and the melodies of Music on the Reef continue to enchant generations to come."

        "content": "(OAKLAND, CA – November 10, 2023) Today, a consortium of universities, development agencies, and NGOs announced the launch of Climate REEFS, a collaborative project to advance socially equitable climate change adaptation for coastal communities that depend on coral reef resources in Indonesia and the Philippines. Climate REEFS is a project under the UK-Canada   research framework programme and the UK Blue Planet Fund’s Climate and Ocean Adaptation and Sustainable Transition (COAST) programme. Partners include   (Indonesia), the  , and the international NGOs   and the   (CORAL). According to a  , an additional 68 to 135 million people could be pushed into poverty by 2030 because of climate change. As more frequent marine heatwaves endanger the livelihoods and food security of about 1 billion people globally who benefit from coral reef ecosystems, evidence-based adaptation strategies are paramount to ensuring biodiversity protection and sustainable use. Currently, management approaches mostly target reefs less exposed to heat stress but ignore biological and social adaptation that can reduce the risks that climate change poses to sustainable ocean livelihoods. Climate REEFS will help solve this problem by identifying adaptive reefs from space and by characterizing the social vulnerabilities of different stakeholders, particularly women and marginalized groups. The project will quantify how reef structure predicts species and genetic diversity, which likely links to a reef’s capacity to adapt to climate change. It also aims to develop socially equitable, context-specific climate adaptation pathways. “Climate REEFS will implement social research to identify the climate vulnerability of coastal communities together with gender and socially inclusive adaptation pathways, geospatial research to detect adaptive reefs from satellite-derived data, and ecological and genomic research to pilot an analysis that tests the interplay of climate change-adaptiveness from genes to people,” said  , University of Leeds, and lead PI of the project.  “The impacts of climate change are not felt evenly across genders and geographies. It is particularly important to understand how degraded coral reefs are impacting women and other marginalized groups in the Asia Pacific so we can design climate adaptation strategies that support all members of a community,” said  , Managing Director of Rare’s Fish Forever program. The project aims to work both on local and national levels towards sustainable climate-smart coastal fishing livelihoods. “Climate REEFS will help people in the village get information on the health of their reefs, how they are used, and help develop policies about their future use. Most fishers never see the reef so they don’t realise their impact,” said  , Director of Maritime and Marine Science Center of Excellence at the Pattimura University. “It is exciting to have this multi-disciplinary team coming together to conduct innovative research that will inform policy and management as well as strengthen science capacity in Indonesia and the Philippines,” said  , Conservation Science Director of the Coral Reef Alliance.   Climate REEFS is part of CLARE’s first cohort of projects. CLARE is a £110m, UK-Canada framework research programme on Climate Adaptation and Resilience, aiming to enable socially inclusive and sustainable action to build resilience to climate change and natural hazards. CLARE is an initiative jointly designed and run by the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office and Canada’s International Development Research Centre. CLARE is primarily funded by UK aid from the UK government, along with the International Development Research Centre, Canada.  The project is also funded through FCDO’s £154m COAST programme, which is part of the UK’s £500m Blue Planet Fund portfolio. COAST aims to support climate change adaptation and more prosperous, sustainable, and resilient coastal economies, focusing on protecting and restoring coastal habitats, strengthening the sustainability and climate resilience of small-scale fisheries, unlocking more sustainable aquaculture production, and driving inclusive coastal governance and planning.

        "content": "In a heartbreaking turn of events, two large coral reefs off the coast of Honduras as well as other reefs in the Caribbean have fallen victim to the destructive forces of coral bleaching, a consequence of warming waters due to climate change. The catastrophic damage of these vibrant and biodiverse ecosystems underscores the urgent need for immediate action to protect and restore our oceans. The dangerous combination of rising ocean temperatures and poor water quality has led to widespread  , presenting significant challenges to Cordelia Banks, a protected area off the SouthWest coast of Roatan in the Bay Islands, as well as Capiro in Tela off the North coast of Honduras. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing the loss of their vibrant colors and weakening their ability to survive. Corals can bounce back from bleaching events, especially if they are healthy and the environmental stressors are alleviated in time. These once-thriving reefs, teeming with life and biodiversity, now highlight the pressing challenges climate change poses to our planet’s delicate ecosystems. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and our partners stand at the forefront of the battle, leveraging 30 years of expertise and unwavering commitment to coral reef conservation. Together, we’re dedicated to not only addressing these challenges but also to revitalizing and restoring the vibrancy and biodiversity of these essential marine habitats. With our commitment to preserving these underwater wonders, CORAL emphasizes the importance of acting swiftly to prevent further damage to neighboring reefs. Our team and partners focus heavily on reducing stressors to the reef, including securing clean water and implementing sustainable fishing practices, to give corals a better chance of survival in warming waters. I’ve lived alongside these reefs most of my life, so to see this devastation first-hand is heartbreaking. We need all hands on deck to swiftly reduce local threats to allow coral reefs to adapt to climate change. The most important local actions needed are to eliminate sewage pollution, increase protection, and implement effective management measures to restore the ecosystem so it can adapt to more challenges ahead. Now, more than ever, we call on individuals and organizations to   and accelerate the expansion of our efforts to reduce threats of wastewater pollution in Tela, Coxen Hole, and other emblematic sites across the Western Caribbean. The time to act is now, as we witness first-hand the window of opportunity to safeguard these precious ecosystems rapidly closing. First and foremost, our focus is on understanding the full impact. We’ve partnered with the Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI) to apply the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) for past studies and will join forces with them again to assess the ecological impacts and reef health monitoring in emblematic sites across the Mesoamerican Region. We’re also delving into the social and economic impacts, exploring potential partnerships to broaden our insights. When it comes to interventions, we’re identifying both short-term and long-term solutions, such as promoting sustainable tourism best practices to reduce pressure, supporting sustainable fisheries, and effective enforcement within the MPAs, as well as collaborating closely with the Bay Islands National Marine Park Technical Committee (BINMP-TC) and the Tela Inter-Institutional Environmental and Protected Areas Committee (CIAT) to continue assessing the situation and planning joint next steps. Communication is key. We’re keeping decision-makers and local communities in the loop with briefings and clear information. Feedback from our team on the ground and in the water will be critical to sharing updates. Once we’ve assessed the situation, we’ll enact next steps to maximize resilience. This will include more effective management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), like providing technical assistance to local stakeholders, capacity building, and funding MPA co-managers to implement their critical programs. On the local front, we’re teaming up with partners like The Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA) and Tela Reef Friend’s Association (AMATELA) to tackle local sanitation issues through water quality monitoring. We are working alongside local organizations in creating budgets and fundraising to make sanitation management models a reality. The goal is to have these models adapted to different coral reef communities around the world. Tools to replicate these adaptable and scalable management models will be publicly available this summer. Click here to be notified when this toolkit is available. (link to a sign-up page) And, of course, we can’t forget about the reefs themselves. Simultaneously, we’re supporting the enforcement of MPA regulations and safeguarding fisheries by partnering with the Roatan Marine Park (RMP) and the Foundation for the Protection of Lancetilla, Punta Sal and Texiguat (PROLANSATE) to ramp up patrols. RMP and Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA), lead efforts to identify restoration methods for the damaged reefs, which complement our priorities to address wastewater and fisheries. Collectively we’re actively looking into what research is needed to ensure we’re making all the right moves. Collaborating with experts to fill information gaps related to sanitation, coral health, and water quality is a priority. We’re building capacity for MPA co-managers, ensuring we have the knowledge and skills needed for effective conservation. Our work isn’t limited to reacting to the current threats; we’re working diligently to shape a resilient future for our coral reefs and the communities that depend on them. Your support is pivotal in turning these plans into action. So what can you do? To make a global impact, think local. Support local initiatives and conservation organizations, adjust your daily habits to include more sustainable practices, and keep learning. Then turn that knowledge into practice. Together, we can safeguard our oceans and leave a legacy of thriving marine ecosystems for generations to come."

        "content": "As we celebrate Earth Month, a time dedicated to preserving the beauty of our planet, it’s critical to confront the brutal reality facing one of its most iconic ecosystems: coral reefs.  Today,   that “the world is experiencing its fourth global coral bleaching event.” Since early 2023   Tragically, NOAA’s report shares that they have “now received confirmation of widespread bleaching across parts of the Indian Ocean, including Tanzania, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Tromelin, Mayotte, and off the western coast of Indonesia.”   as we’re seeing coral bleaching  . Let’s talk about what this means and what’s next. As global temperatures continue to rise, marine heatwaves have become more frequent and severe, subjecting coral reefs to prolonged stress. The result is widespread  , a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to their stark white appearance and eventual death if the stress persists. This fourth global bleaching event is a glaring reminder of the urgent need for decisive action to combat a warming planet and help coral reefs adapt to climate change.  If there was ever a time to roll up your sleeves and get involved in this fight,   We must take immediate action to lessen further damage to coral reefs while they’re in this vulnerable state.  The CORAL team worked together to launch the   last summer. This toolkit provides essential resources and strategies to aid in conservation efforts surrounding a bleaching event. A recent update includes more remote sensing and on-site monitoring resources and introduces a section dedicated to online apps. As we face mass coral bleaching, we hope that the update of our Toolkit and Guide provides a timely compilation of resources of what can be done before, during, and after a bleaching event, and galvanizes support for these amazing ecosystems. The toolkit contains actionable guidelines for reporting bleaching events, monitoring reef health, and implementing best practices for tourism sites to minimize additional stress on coral ecosystems. By following these guidelines and taking proactive measures, we are helping reduce stressors to coral reefs to minimize the devastating impacts of bleaching on marine biodiversity.  Coral bleaching demands urgent global collaboration to highlight its severity and drive better policies. This Toolkit consolidates information from diverse organizations working on coral bleaching into one accessible resource. Now, urgent steps are needed to integrate these efforts and datasets to ensure unified communication. In addition to providing guidance and resources, like the coral bleaching toolkit and water quality monitoring protocol, all members of the CORAL team are committed to the collective action of our alliance and partnerships, especially supporting local efforts on the ground and in the water. As our conservation science work has shown, corals can adapt to climate change…if we help them. Our team is working diligently toward   in coastal communities so coral reefs have a fighting chance in this warming world. During these critical times of bleaching, we’re working closely with our partners to assess the evolving situation and provide necessary resources and funding for monitoring efforts and studies. In our 30 years of coral conservation, we know   More specifically, this includes sharing replicable models to empower coastal communities near priority reefs to take control of their wastewater treatment and fishing practices. It also includes education around sustainable tourism and augmenting ocean literacy, particularly for youths. As we sit on the cusp of this fourth global bleaching event –   – we’re reminded of the urgent need for bold and decisive action to protect coral reefs from the consequences of coral bleaching, as well as addressing the root cause: climate change. Corals will not survive for generations to come unless rising carbon emissions are tackled with intention.  We must come together as a global community to protect and preserve these invaluable ecosystems. By leveraging the power of science, innovation, and collective action, we can alter the grim trajectory we’re on and reposition coral reefs toward a more sustainable future. As part of the CORAL community, we must continuously reinforce that action is the best remedy for despair.  For all media inquiries, please contact Kate at  ."

        "content": "Coral reefs, rainforests of the sea, are magnificent and diverse ecosystems teeming with life. Within this underwater wonderland,   Remarkable creatures like parrotfish and surgeonfish serve as nature’s custodians, diligently preserving the health of coral reefs by curbing the growth of algae, which, if left unchecked, can pose significant threats to the entire ecosystem. Among the many herbivorous fish species, parrotfish and surgeonfish stand out for their remarkable contributions.  Parrotfish, in particular, exhibit a fascinating life cycle. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, beginning their lives as females and later transitioning into males as they grow and environmental factors change. (What?!) Living in harems, where one dominant male controls a group of females, parrotfish are essential for maintaining the delicate balance within the group. If the alpha male is removed, it takes several months for a female to transition into the male role, impacting the reproductive cycle of the school. Surgeonfish, with their distinctive spines and vibrant colors, are another vital component of coral reef ecosystems.   These herbivorous fish species, with their unique traits and behaviors, contribute significantly to the overall resilience of coral reefs. , constantly feeding on algae that grow on coral reefs. Algae, when left uncontrolled, can outcompete corals for space and sunlight, eventually smothering them. By  , herbivore fish help to maintain the growth and vitality of corals, ensuring the reef ecosystem thrives. Moreover, some herbivores, like parrotfish, also aid in coral growth by  . This seemingly destructive behavior promotes the development of new polyps,  . These natural processes, guided by the activities of herbivorous fish, are essential for the overall health and biodiversity of coral reefs. While herbivore fish are indispensable guardians of coral reefs, their populations face numerous threats, with overfishing being one of the most pressing concerns.  disrupts the natural balance within herbivore communities, leading to a decrease in their numbers. When these essential fish are overharvested, the algae they would have consumed takes over. As a result, corals become vulnerable, facing increased competition for space and sunlight, and are more susceptible to diseases. The  , impacting not only the herbivore fish but also the corals, other marine life, and, ultimately, the communities that depend on these reefs for their livelihoods. , including agricultural runoff, plastic waste, and chemicals, can contaminate the water, disrupting the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem. Prolonged exposure to pollutants weakens the immunity of corals and herbivore fish, making them more susceptible to diseases and other stressors.  Rising sea temperatures due to global warming cause  , a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leaving them vulnerable and colorless.  , another consequence of climate change, hampers the ability of corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, making them weaker and more susceptible to damage. What makes these threats particularly concerning is their interconnected nature. Overfishing weakens herbivore fish populations, making them less resilient to other stressors such as pollution and climate change. Likewise, the impacts of pollution and climate change, such as coral bleaching and weakened corals, create additional challenges for herbivore fish by reducing the availability of suitable habitats and food sources. Addressing these threats requires a comprehensive approach that involves sustainable fisheries management, reducing pollution, and mitigating climate change. Conservation efforts, such as those championed by organizations like Fishpono, are instrumental in raising awareness, conducting research, and implementing initiatives to protect herbivore fish populations and coral reefs. Together, through collective action and a shared commitment to marine conservation, we can ensure that herbivore fish continue their vital role as guardians of coral reefs, preserving these magnificent underwater ecosystems for generations to come. Here’s to a future where the unsung heroes of the coral reefs thrive, and the reefs themselves continue to enchant and inspire us all."

        "content": "In the conservation and nonprofit sector, we throw around a lot of acronyms.  To our team, none are more important than “MPA” – a marine protected area. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designated areas of the ocean that are set aside for conservation and management purposes. These areas are intended to preserve and protect the marine life and their habitats within them. They also promote sustainable use of these resources. By establishing MPAs, we can ensure that our oceans remain healthy and full of life for future generations to come. Research has shown that MPAs can significantly improve carbon sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms, as well as the catches and income of fishers. But, efficacy matters. Why are MPAs so important to our mission, you ask? They can be as effective as national parks for areas of preserved land.  But only if they are truly managed effectively.  What we don’t want is “paper parks” – parks that are established but then lack sufficient management and enforcement of regulations and conservation plans.  Any park can look good on paper but an effective MPA takes the work of many nonprofits, local governments, and community stakeholders. In the Western Caribbean, CORAL is working hard to reduce local threats to coral reefs within marine protected areas (MPAs) and to construct regional collaborations that facilitate better protection and regulation of these ocean zones. MPAs are critical if we want vital ecological entities like the Mesoamerican Reef System (MAR) – which stretches 625 miles along the coast of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras and is the largest reef network in the western hemisphere – to recover and heal from damages caused by  , land-based pollution and unsustainable tourism. To give corals the best chance for adapting to climate change, CORAL focuses on what is putting them at risk, including improving MPA governance in Honduras, Belize and Mexico. But, why do MPAs matter? Firstly, MPAs provide a sanctuary for marine species. With over 90% of the world’s fish stocks either fully fished or overfished, it is essential to protect the habitats and breeding grounds of marine species to ensure their survival. Fully and highly protected MPAs create safe spaces where fish populations can thrive, reproduce, and grow in numbers. In turn, this supports the larger oceanic ecosystem. MPAs help to ensure the long-term sustainability of our oceans and the fish that depend on them. Secondly, MPAs help to  . The oceans are home to an incredible variety of life, from tiny plankton to massive whales, and everything in between. MPAs help to preserve this biodiversity by providing a range of habitats for different species. By protecting different types of habitats, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, and kelp forests, MPAs ensure that a diverse range of marine life can continue to exist in our oceans. Thirdly, MPAs  . Many coastal communities around the world depend on fishing for their livelihoods. MPAs provide a way to manage and sustainably use these resources, ensuring that fish populations do not become depleted, and fishing can continue for generations to come. MPAs can also attract tourists, providing a source of income for local economies and creating jobs in areas such as eco-tourism and marine research. By working together to establish and manage MPAs, we can create a brighter future for our oceans and the people and animals that depend on them. So, let’s join forces and protect our oceans – together, we can make a difference!"

But increased popularity means many of the natural resources in these locations are in need of protection. That’s where a Destination Management Organization (DMO) comes into play.  A DMO is a body that manages all aspects of a tourism destination. It protects nature and the area’s cultural heritage, while also maintaining its appeal to travelers. The organization brings together government, civil society, and industry stakeholders to secure funding, protect the area’s natural environments, and simultaneously boost its economy.  Here at CORAL, we are actively involved in the development and maintenance of a DMO in Cozumel, which is only the second DMO created in Mexico. Due to the area’s lively coral reefs and a local economy reliant on them, Cozumel is an important destination to protect and a DMO will help us in that process.  Cozumel’s coral reefs are part of the Mesoamerican Reef, which is the second largest barrier reef on the planet. But in the last two years, environmental factors impacting coral reefs, like   and  , along with the devastating effects of the pandemic, have led to a significant decline in Cozumel’s tourism, an industry that accounts for 85 percent of jobs on the island. “Cozumel will only stay a viable destination if we keep its natural environment healthy,” says Javier Pizaña-Alonso, CORAL’s Program Manager in Mexico and the local DMO’s president. “That’s why it is so important that we focus our efforts on protection—especially the protection of coral reefs.”  Cozumel’s DMO is part of a bigger initiative led by our partner,  .  Together, we are uniting the Caribbean’s three major cruise destinations: Cozumel, Roatan, and Belize, in order to preserve Mesoamerica’s natural and cultural heritage. Each destination is developing their own DMO and is working with different sectors to meet sustainability goals and initiatives.  “A priority of these DMOs is to protect all natural environments, including the Mesoamerican Reef” says Pizaña-Alonso. “In Cozumel, the DMO will keep its corals healthy by implementing initiatives focused on waste management, water and sanitation, and climate change.” In order to fulfill long-term conservation initiatives, Pizaña-Alonso is building an ongoing relationship with the local government.  According to Pizaña-Alonso, it is important that members of the local government want to be involved in the DMO, as it makes it much easier to secure the funds needed to support coral reef conservation. “Around the world, successful DMOs that improved the sustainable tourism dynamic were all supported by the local government and private sector,” says Pizaña-Alonso.  This can be challenging when newly elected officials come into power; however, Pizaña-Alonso is thrilled to announce that Cozumel’s DMO is one of few local projects that has succeeded across multiple administrations.  Through a coordinated approach to sustainable tourism, we are optimistic that we can keep Cozumel’s coral reefs healthy and thriving, which in turn supports the many marine animals and people that are dependent on them. "

        "content": "Could a map be used to estimate the likelihood that a coral reef can adapt to climate change? That’s one of the biggest questions driving our Global Conservation Science team these days. In collaboration with the  , a global map and monitoring system for shallow water coral reefs, we are leading new, cutting-edge research to determine the Atlas’s ability to identify which reefs are more likely to be able to adapt to climate change.  CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, Dr. Helen Fox, is spearheading the initiative and working with researchers at the University of Miami and an independent postdoc.  The Atlas consists of different data layers that online users can turn on or off to view characteristics of a reef, like bottom type and reef structure, which is mapped from imagery detected by satellites in space, and then ground-truthed by local scientists around the world.  Scientists, including Fox, predict—and are working to prove—that the areas shown by the Atlas to have a wide range of diversity in reef type and structure correlate to a high range of temperatures on a reef. This would likely mean greater genetic diversity of corals. If that’s the case, then the Atlas could be used to predict which reefs have a higher potential of adapting to climate change.  Around the world, coral reefs are suffering from the impacts of warming ocean temperatures—which is the cause of mass bleaching events and the loss of 14 percent of the planet’s corals in the last decade. But research has shown that some corals can adapt to these higher temperatures. It is important to reduce human impacts in these “hot reef” areas so those heat-adapted corals can reproduce and spread their genes. “As the oceans warm, we are hoping there are some corals that can survive the warming waters,” says Fox. “We then want those corals to reproduce, so they build future generations of coral that are also able to tolerate warmer temperatures.”    If Fox and her team determine that the Atlas can, in fact, be used to estimate a reef’s adaptation potential, the next step will be to use this data layer during marine spatial planning. That would give decision-makers the information needed to help prioritize protections for coral reefs that have a higher potential of adapting to future ocean conditions.  Many countries and coastal regions are already setting goals to increase the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) in their waters. Some areas, like Hawai’i, have pledged to protect at least 30 percent of its coral reefs with MPAs by 2030. Those MPAs could be even more effective if they include coral reefs that could help spread adaptive traits to other coral reefs.   “We are fighting to protect an incredibly valuable marine ecosystem,” says Fox. “The loss of coral reefs will be devastating for the ocean, as well as for coastal communities that rely on them for food and income.”  Since launching last year, the Atlas   in many parts of the world. From Mozambique to Sri Lanka to the Bahamas, the map has supported research and improved planning strategies, in the hopes of ultimately helping preserve the health of coral reefs.  Our work to better understand which coral reefs have a higher potential of adapting to climate change will ultimately benefit these many conservation efforts. According to Fox, acting now is essential as the fate of coral reefs will likely be decided in the next 25 years. "

        "content": "By: Ben Charo, Conservation Science Program Coordinator  If we don’t curb greenhouse gas emissions and slow the warming of our oceans, 99% of the world’s coral reefs are predicted to be gone by the end of this century. Indeed, reefs are already in  . So it might surprise you to hear that within the next few hundred years, corals could adapt, rebound, and survive if given the chance to evolve. The key? Genetic variation.  Genetic variation is the fuel of evolution. It’s also a big part of what makes every individual organism on this planet unique. Even the slightest genetic differences can lead to discrepancies in height, eye color, the probability of contracting diseases, and other distinctions. Organisms with genes that are best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, sending their unique genetic code on to the next generation. This process is known as  . Over multiple generations of natural selection, species can begin to display new traits and characteristics—you’ve likely heard this referred to as evolution.  It stands to reason that the more genetically diverse a population of organisms is, the more diverse its pool of individuals will be, and the more likely that some of those individuals will be able to adapt to whatever circumstances arise. It’s this idea that is essential to coral reefs surviving the heat stress created by climate change.  In an article published in  last year, CORAL team members and partners confirmed that genetically diverse coral reef networks were much more likely to survive warming waters than their less diverse counterparts. The graph (Figure 1a from the paper) illustrates a number of simulations run for the Caribbean region. In the graph, RCP8.5 represents a high-greenhouse gas emissions scenario (leading to a warmer planet and warmer oceans), while in RCP4.5, emissions are stabilized. You’ll notice that corals without genetic variability (V = 0) were wiped out completely with high emissions and barely survived with low emissions. Corals with moderate variability (V = .01) were able to recover in a cooler climate scenario, but perished under the high-emissions scenario. And corals with high variability (V = 0.1) survived regardless of climate circumstances.  When these simulations were run on coral reefs in other regions across the globe, corals behaved very similarly. The key takeaways: 1) genetic variability is critical to coral reef survival, and 2) we must meet corals halfway by acting urgently to reduce emissions. Our research also found that genetic connections  coral reefs were crucial to their prospects. When corals reproduce, their larvae move with ocean currents and can be carried along to other reefs, where they settle and grow. That means coral reefs are genetically connected to one another through flows of larvae from reef to reef. According to our research, coral reefs that received larger amounts of larvae from other reefs were more likely to survive the effects of climate change than those that received fewer. This was especially true for reefs in colder water that received heat-adapted larvae from hotter reefs. In short, preserving genetic variability is important, but so is promoting genetic exchange, especially from reefs that are already adapted to high temperatures.  These findings present us with a few key implications for how we can help corals survive warming oceans. First, we must reduce carbon emissions and slow the rate of climate change to give corals a fighting chance. National governments in countries that   for global carbon emissions must bear the brunt of this work, but individuals can make a difference as well. Second, we must protect a diversity of reefs that are themselves genetically diverse. Doing so increases the odds that heat-adapted individuals will be present and naturally selected. Third, we can’t just protect individual patches of reef; we must ensure that reefs are protected in connected networks to allow the exchange of genes. And finally, we must pay particular attention to the presence of hot reefs in these networks, which should allow heat-adapted larvae to spread to other reefs.  There’s one last piece of the puzzle to coral reef survival: reducing additional pressure from local stressors. When confronted with threats, such as   or  , reefs are less likely to recover from coral bleaching events. We must make sure corals aren’t hit from multiple angles at once by tackling these issues.  Through global conservation science and locally-based efforts, CORAL is leading the charge on making this vision for coral reef survival a reality. In Hawai’i and the Mesoamerican Reef region, our conservation teams are improving water quality, protecting reefs from overfishing, and eliminating as much additional pressure on these ecosystems as possible so they’re able to withstand the threat of climate change.  Meanwhile, our Global Conservation Science team is turning this science into action by influencing and leveraging partners, fieldwork, and technology to drive adaptation-focused conservation solutions that will rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change. Our approach consists of three main pillars:  If you’re a coral reef conservation practitioner, we hope you’ll consider the principles described above as you approach reef protection. And, no matter who you are, we hope you’ll use your voice to advocate for climate-smart policies, and invest in CORAL’s groundbreaking work to save coral reefs.

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "In many scientific communities, “coral restoration” refers to the act of growing corals and then planting them in the wild. While it’s an incredibly popular method of coral reef conservation, research has shown that if done alone, the act of growing and planting corals is unlikely to save coral reefs. For starters, it only works if local threats to coral reefs are reduced. If corals are planted in an area where existing corals are already threatened by wastewater pollution or overfishing, then the newly planted corals don’t have a high chance of survival. Climate change is another concern—as ocean temperatures warm, corals that aren’t heat tolerant will have a harder time surviving. In some situations, scientists and conservationists focus just on planting coral species that are more heat tolerant. But that can be inherently risky, because it means that we as humans are picking the species that we believe will be better suited for future conditions, when we don’t know with certainty what those future conditions will be. In some situations, corals can be bred to be more heat tolerant—these are sometimes called “super corals.” While this sounds promising,   that we collaborated on  in order for these types of outplanting projects to be effective at protecting corals from climate change, they would need to be done at a large scale for hundreds of years in conjunction with efforts to reduce local threats to coral reefs. That’s not to say that growing corals and planting them in the wild isn’t worthwhile—it can be a great way to repopulate an area after a storm or boat anchor damage, for example. It can also be helpful in engaging communities and tourists, and bringing more awareness to the plight of coral reefs. In fact, a lot of our partners engage in coral planting and have found it to yield promising results when combined with reducing local threats to reefs. Outside of specific scientific and conservation communities, the term “restoration” refers to reverting something to its original or natural state. When it comes to coral reefs, that is definitely something we do—and it’s a practice that can save coral reefs. Our programs that focus on securing clean water for reefs and addressing overfishing aim to restore coral reefs to a more natural, healthier state and protect them from human impacts. And our research shows that when we restore coral reefs in this way, they can adapt to climate change on their own—without too much human interference. What does this kind of restoration look like on the ground? It looks like   in Honduras, where we helped the community operationalize a wastewater treatment plant and as a result saw the amount of coral disease drop from 25 percent to zero percent. It looks like   where over 100 volunteers have restored a section of dirt roads by using native plants to trap sediment runoff and keep it off coral reefs. And it looks like  , where we’ve seen a 483 percent increase in fish biomass after partnering with communities to build sustainable fisheries. All of these efforts help restore coral reefs back to a healthier state, where they not only have a better chance of adapting to climate change, but are also more resilient to disease, storm damage, bleaching, and more. There are two parts to this: the first is curbing our carbon emissions to reduce the rate of climate change. There are a lot of great organizations working in this space and advancing initiatives around clean energy, sustainable production, and more. While we still have a long way to go to truly solve the climate crisis, the fact that we are seeing these conversations and this work more amplified than ever before gives us hope. We’re also doing our part by joining public calls to action, sitting on global committees to influence governments that make climate decisions, and using our position as scientists and conservationists to build more awareness around the urgency of climate action. The second part is what we focus on at CORAL: building networks of healthy, adaptive coral reefs. We know that coral larvae can travel for miles before ultimately settling on a reef. We also know that some corals have adapted to become more heat tolerant than others. Therefore, we reduce local threats where corals are already more heat tolerant and in places where their babies are settling, which allows corals to spread their heat-tolerant genes and ultimately change the overall makeup of some coral reefs to become more heat tolerant. So yes, coral restoration that focuses on reducing human impacts and reverting corals back to a healthier, less threatened state can save coral reefs. And in some cases, coral planting to supplement those efforts might make sense, particularly in places where threats have already been addressed."

On April 22, more than one billion people will mobilize and advocate to protect our planet’s beautiful resources, animals, and ecosystems. At CORAL, we are committed to saving one of the most important ocean environments: coral reefs.  Coral reefs are both animals and ecosystems, and they add so much value to our planet. They act as home to more than a million marine species, give protection to coastal areas, and support countless people with food and income.  But coral reefs are in trouble. In fact, we’ve lost at least 14 percent of the world’s reefs in the last decade alone. That’s why we are fighting so hard to reduce environmental threats and keep coral reefs healthy. On April 22, you can stand with our alliance by spreading the word about coral reef conservation and taking actions that protect these valuable ecosystems.  Here are six simple ways you can protect coral reefs on Earth Day It’s hard to protect coral reefs if you aren’t sure what’s threatening them. Spend your Earth Day   to coral reefs and what can be done to reduce this stress. At CORAL, we focus on minimizing overfishing and water pollution—two major problems that can ultimately devastate a reef. Without healthy fish populations, algae can take over an ocean environment and make it harder for coral reefs to grow. And if the water is polluted with waste, marine debris, or runoff sediment, it spreads harmful chemicals and can spur the growth of algae.   to learn more about threats to coral reefs and how you can help protect them.  Planning a summer vacation? Make your plans with the environment in mind! There are plenty of easy ways to make your trip more eco-friendly, like committing to “leave no trace” on the beach or reducing your use of plastic and single-use materials. You can also make a conscious choice to stay at sustainable lodging and support local businesses when visiting a location.  Check out our   for more tips on how to protect coral reefs during your next vacation. Climate change might be one of the biggest existential threats the world is facing—and may determine the fate of our reefs if we don’t make a change. Ocean waters are warming, which increases the likelihood of coral bleaching events. Research shows that coral reefs can adapt to some rising temperatures, but only if we slow down our CO2 emissions.   There are  —including driving less, reducing your meat consumption, buying local, recycling, using less energy at home, and more. And most importantly,   to take bigger steps to reduce worldwide emissions.  Did you know an estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen is deposited into the ocean annually? Worst of all, much of that sunscreen brings harmful chemicals that affect corals’ reproductive cycle, damage DNA, and worsen the effects of coral bleaching. Keep reefs healthy by using mineral sunscreen with non-nano Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide as the active ingredient. And don’t just use it at the beach—sunscreen can easily spread through our waterways and enter our oceans, even if you’re far from the water. To learn more,  If we are going to make a real change, the message needs to be widespread. Use Earth Day as an opportunity to teach somebody else why they should care about saving coral reefs.  Share our  or encourage a friend or family member to follow us on   or   to learn more about coral reef ecosystems. Lastly, you can save coral reefs by directly supporting programs that keep them healthy and thriving.  , you will minimize overfishing, reduce ocean pollution, invest in cutting-edge science and research, and support coastal communities with the skills and resources needed to protect their reefs.  Best of all, from now until April 22, you can double your impact with our special Earth Day match: thanks to our partners at Gili Sports, all donations up to $15,000 will be matched 1:1.

This partnership offers an opportunity to take steps toward reducing water pollution and expanding sustainable tourism programs that protect Belize’s coral reefs.  One of our long-term projects in Belize is setting the foundation for the construction of a wastewater treatment system in Caye Caulker, a small island off the coast of Belize City. This could help ensure coral reefs have the clean water they need, similar to what we achieved in West End, Honduras. By partnering with the local community in West End, we operationalized a wastewater treatment system which decreased the amount of bacteria in nearshore waters by more than 99 percent between 2013 and 2020.  The project was so successful that the community in Caye Caulker is now interested in collaborating on a similar initiative. The island shares similarities to where we’ve worked in Honduras, in addition to having valuable coral reefs that offer food and economic opportunities to the local community.  Right now, poor water quality from an inadequate wastewater treatment system threatens the health of coral reefs, surrounding marine animals, and people in Caye Caulker. By advancing this project, we will begin to implement a better system that benefits both the community and its reefs. Additionally, we are promoting sustainable tourism opportunities in and around Belize City, which will help protect the area’s natural resources and build a culture that prioritizes the environment.  “We are reshaping the perception of tourism in Belize,” says Tanya Amaya, CORAL’s regional program director. “A tourism destination is more than just a place to visit, it is also a community. By building a culture of sustainable tourism, we can also help protect and create benefits for the community, like securing clean water or promoting safety.”  Currently, we are collaborating with relevant stakeholders to establish a  . This locally managed entity would oversee different aspects of the tourism destination and safeguard the area’s natural and cultural heritage. As part of that initiative, we are also promoting an   for tourism operators, which focuses on ways to teach travelers about conservation.  To support both these sanitation and tourism initiatives, we are maintaining the regional water quality monitoring program in Belize that we launched in 2020. Through this program, we have built a network of partners that monitor offshore water quality across 90 sites in the Western Caribbean in order to determine the impact of land-based pollution in high-tourism areas and identify areas that require wastewater and sanitation interventions.  Land-based pollution, often a result of inefficient wastewater management, uncontrolled coastal development, and unsustainable agricultural activities, can bring excess nutrients that spur algal growth. When algae become too prominent on coral reefs, they can block the sunlight that reaches corals (an important source of nutrients) and impact the overall health of the ecosystem and its animals.  “Monitoring water quality in Belize gives us the necessary data to advocate for more sustainable projects and solutions in the region,” says Amaya. “Together with local partners and community members, we are fighting for the health of key coral reefs and supporting coastal communities that are dependent on those ecosystems.”  Thanks to our partnership with the BTB, we are able to push forward these important initiatives in Belize. We look forward to continuing this ongoing partnership and celebrating the success it brings this year."

Leadership also recognizes CORAL can provide many new opportunities for the network, and we hope you can accept our invitation.” Mejia’s excited to continue working with the network through CORAL, and finds a lot of synergy between his approach to conservation and that of the network. “Things are so siloed in conservation between ecology, conservation science, etc., but my approach has always been biocultural,” he describes. “You can’t take humans out of the equation, especially in Hawai‘i and the Pacific where they are part of the same equation; you can’t consider one without the other.” He also sees CORAL’s collaborative and partnership-based approach as a natural fit, and views this partnership as a win-win for coral reefs. “We will be able to learn so much from each other,” says Mejia. “I’m excited to learn from their experiences working with local communities, and share our lessons learned about how to effectively reduce local threats to reefs. Together, we can reduce local stressors to help coral reefs adapt to climate change, so both our oceans and our communities can survive and thrive well into the future.”"

Their hard work and dedication helps CORAL achieve our mission of uniting communities to save coral reefs. Among this stellar network of volunteers, Charley Dofa stands out as an exceptional volunteer and a local hero. Raised on the grounds of the old Olowalu Sugar Company in West Maui, Charley’s responsibility to mālama ‘aina (take care of the land) began at a young age while helping his grandpa in the family garden. Charley’s natural ability to work the land transitioned into a career in landscaping and later, a heavy machinery operation. Maui has a rich agricultural history with pineapple and sugar plantations, but in the early 21  century plantations started to shut down and many workers lost their jobs. Charley witnessed firsthand how difficult it was for people to afford fresh produce and maintain a consistent connection to the land. “That’s when I became motivated to start a community farm. To help people grow their own food. To make peoples’ dreams come true.” In 2011, with the help of Tova Callender of the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative, Charley started the organic  , of which he is currently the Vice President. “It’s hard for families now because you have to work multiple jobs just to get by, so the garden is a good place to grow what they would need to spend money on. It’s a no-brainer. People start to see how empowering it is to grow your own food. It tastes better because it’s grown from your own heart.” Charley’s knowledge about gardening and farming is a major asset to CORAL’s work. In West Maui, fallow agricultural lands and the design of dirt roads within these plantations creates easy pathways for sediment to travel to the ocean. In West Maui, CORAL’s   Initiative prevents sediment and nutrient pollution from reaching the ocean and degrading reefs. CORAL staff and volunteers like Charley plant native vegetation near decommissioned roads adjacent to streams in fallow agricultural lands, a practice called replanting. Replanting helps to restore ecosystem services, slow and infiltrate the flow of storm water, and plant roots stabilize soil to reduce erosion and sediment from reaching and smothering our coral reefs. Throughout the years, Charley has observed that people and community partnerships are essential for conservation success, which exemplifies CORAL’s mission of uniting communities to save coral reefs. “The biggest impact is when people have the opportunity to get involved in the process. Through working, one learns.” CORAL is uniting the community of West Maui with the help of volunteers like Charley, and recently established Native Planting Days for volunteers to participate in our stream restoration techniques. We want to Mahalo Charley Dofa for all the work he does to support conservation projects in West Maui. If you’d like to volunteer with CORAL, please fill out our Volunteer Interest Form at  .

What does this road a mile from the shoreline have to do with coral reefs? And how can bikers help? In West Maui, water pollution from old dirt roads has led to a decline of coral cover from 30 to just 10 percent in the last fifteen years. Stormwater runoff also regularly causes the Hawaiʻi Department of Health to issue “Brown Water Advisories”, which are warnings to the public to avoid swimming or fishing because of risks to human health. Beach closures negatively impact Hawaii’s natural and cultural heritage, as well as the tourism industry. CORAL, our partners, and volunteers from the community are working to address this threat by planting native plants and deep-rooted grasses along dirt roads that run adjacent to streams. Bringing back native vegetation helps trap sediments and stabilize the soil, while also improving habitat for native plants and animals and creating opportunities for local communities to reconnect with the land. Every month CORAL hosts a Watershed Restoration Day, where a team of volunteers plants native seedlings across abandoned dirt roads. So far, over 200 volunteers have planted approximately 8,000 plants, which are effectively reducing sediment pollution across West Maui. Motorcyclists recreationally traveling along these roads were unknowingly running over our seedlings and sediment traps, rendering them ineffective. When CORAL staff realized this, we decided to create an educational poster asking bikers for their collaboration. The signs explain the connection between these plants and coral reefs and respectfully asks bikers to take an alternative road. The bikers are listening. Since the signs were installed, we no longer find our plants being damaged by biker wheels. We can all do our small part to help, and CORAL is excited to engage this new and unexpected ally in protecting Maui’s coral reefs!"

Jen is CORAL’s Program Manager in Maui, and she’s leading the charge on restoring Maui’s once lush forest to stabilize the soil and protect coral reefs downstream from being smothered by sediment, reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. Jen’s work takes place in two watersheds of West Maui – Honokõwai and Wahikuli – that were identified as “priority watersheds” by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The uphill location of CORAL’s restoration projects tends to surprise people, but what many people don’t realize is that what happens on land has a direct impact on the shoreline. During heavy rainfall, soil and contaminants in watersheds enter streams, travel downstream, and get dumped directly into the ocean. Because ocean currents travel from West Maui’s shores to the coastlines of neighboring islands, these pollutants can end up on coral reefs near and far. The name Wahikuli means “the noisy place” in Hawaiian, named for the sound of rushing water and the loud birds that lived in the cava and breadfruit trees. The forest of native plants once held the soil in place, but now the trees, birds, and water are all gone, and the only sound left is the wind rustling over fallow fields. Decades of commercial farming for sugarcane and pineapple leveled the forest and left a network of dirt roads that provide the ideal conditions for massive amounts of sediment to enter streams and the ocean during rainstorms. Jen’s work isn’t easy. She’s trying to reverse the effects of decades of industrial agriculture by bringing back the forest. She’s also dealing with modern-day challenges, like motorcyclists accidentally running over saplings and monitoring equipment being stolen. Yet she and our team in Maui have made incredible progress, building on years of research by local partners and working groups. Jen leads CORAL’s monthly  , where a team of volunteers plant native seedlings across abandoned roads to prevent erosion. So far, over 200 volunteers have planted approximately 8,000 plants that hold the soil in place and reduce pollution for coral reefs downstream. This work comes at a critical time; Hawaiian reefs are currently experiencing a bleaching event from the warming waters of climate change. But by providing clean water for coral reefs in Maui and across the Hawaiian islands, we can help corals survive these bleaching events and remain a part of Hawaiʻi’s rich landscape and culture."

        "content": "10-year-old Abby Rogers has converted her backyard into a native plant nursery to help save coral reefs. Rogers is a volunteer with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), helping to grow native plants that will be transplanted at their stream restoration site in Wahikuli. The native plants trap sediment that runs off the slope and into the ocean where it smothers coral reefs. Typically, CORAL purchases the plants and hosts volunteer planting days at the stream restoration site. But when COVID-19 restrictions hit and the group planting days were no longer safe, the team put a call out to volunteers to grow the plants at home from seed. “I really wanted to do things for the environment, but had not found a way to really help besides not using a straw or bringing my own bags to the store,” says Rogers. “My mom read about [the CORAL project] in a newspaper article and suggested it to me.” Originally, Rogers signed up to take home three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But once she realized how much fun it was, she signed up for 15 more kits. That brings her total to 900 native plants. Rogers has certainly taken the plunge into her first-ever volunteer project. “I have always been interested in the environment because I have always wanted to help the world,” says the 5  grader. “I spent seven years in China, where I learned firsthand about air and water pollution. Now, living in Hawai‘i, I have been looking for ways I can make a positive impact on the environment.” Rogers is one of 100 volunteers who signed up to grow 25,000 seeds for CORAL. Since not all seeds tend to germinate, CORAL estimates that about 10,000 plants will ultimately be transplanted. “She’s our most prolific volunteer,” says Larissa Treese, CORAL’s Program Coordinator on Maui and the coordinator behind the at-home plant growing volunteer program. “It’s so great seeing the next generation stepping up to save coral reefs—the amount of sediment we’ll be able to trap with the plants she’s growing will definitely have an impact.” Once a volunteer signs up to participate, CORAL provides them with the seeds and instructions on how to grow them. Volunteers can choose whether to donate the rest of the supplies (soil, trays and pots) or whether to borrow them from CORAL. Once the plants are fully grown, the volunteer can return them to CORAL to be transplanted or they can visit the restoration site and transplant them themselves.   CORAL has been engaged in slope restoration in West Maui for several years, using native plants and trees to restore Maui’s once lush forests and reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. The key to CORAL’s success is building strong local partnerships. The restoration project in Wahikuli is a testament to that, bringing together partners like Maui Nui Botanical Gardens, West Maui Ridge 2 Reef and Down the Hatch. “The at-home native plant kits have been a terrific way to bring the community together and keep our volunteers engaged, since we can’t meet in person anymore,” says Treese. “It’s also helped us save the money that we would typically spend on purchasing the fully grown plants.”"

The first Earth Day brought 20 million people together to rally for the protection of the environment, and later that year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed and the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts were passed. Since then, Earth Day has grown to a global event, with people around the world coming together to protect our environment. Almost 50 years later, our planet and its inhabitants are suffering as climate change causes severe ocean heat waves and   We’ve also seen the   over the past 30 years. These devastating consequences of climate change are becoming the new normal for our time. However, if we come together and raise our voices for solutions in the same way that we did when Earth Day was founded, there’s still hope for the state of our world and its inhabitants. At CORAL, we’re developing and promoting solutions that help coral reefs adapt to the effects of climate change so that corals and the ecosystems they support can be celebrated 50 years from now. Our   address local threats to reefs, including water pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction. Our   research shows that when these local threats are reduced, corals are more able to adapt to rising ocean temperatures. By creating networks of healthy reefs, we can ensure the survival of coral reefs for generations to come. We know that the best way to reduce local stressors is in partnership with the people that interact with and depend on coral reefs. For example, in Honduras, our partnerships with residents, business owners, and the government have improved water quality to meet international safe swimming standards in West End, Roatán. We also partnered with local non-profits to make sure that the marine protected areas (MPAs) that we helped establish are effectively managed and well-patrolled, resulting in increased fish biomass. Efforts like these are  , and because this work is part of a network, these reefs contribute to adaptation and repopulation across the entire Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) system. In addition to this work in the MAR, we are creating the conditions that will help corals adapt to the effects of climate change in Hawai’i and with partners in the Caribbean and around the world. But we need your help!  If we rally together the same way we did 50 years ago, our collective efforts can encourage our leaders, industries, and the world to take action to save coral reefs and our planet’s other vital ecosystems. We’ll be sharing more about how we can save coral reefs together during our Earth Day webinar on April 22 . I hope to see you there!"

You’re enjoying a sunny day in the lagoon surrounded by green mangroves, birds singing to one another and monkeys playing among the branches. In the distance, you see local fishermen making their livelihoods, casting lines and nets from offshore hoping for a catch. Unfortunately, the lagoon is under constant threat from overfishing by outside communities who are not complying with the local fishing regulations. In turn, overfishing causes a decline in populations of the reef fish that depend on lagoons as nurseries for their young. Fortunately, the recently passed Ministerial Decree 108-2017 is designed to protect this vital water source that provides food and income for the surrounding 13 communities. Since 2011, CORAL’s Honduras field team and our partners have worked collaboratively in Tela to encourage communication and cooperation among local communities, organizations and government entities. After several years of supporting and working hand in hand with these entities, the Tela Environmental and Protected Areas Interinstitutional Committee was formally recognized and tasked with bringing together all the key players to protect the natural coastal and marine resources of Tela Bay. In 2015, after successfully creating a  , the Committee started discussing solutions to protect the lagoon from unsustainable fishing practices. After two years of meetings between the Interinstitutional Committee and affected communities, they agreed to new fishing regulations which were passed as a law by the Honduran Livestock and Agriculture Secretariat in April 2017. Through successful enforcement of the Ministerial Decree’s stricter fishing regulations and priority access for local fisherman, the idyllic scene I described earlier of the thriving lagoon providing livelihoods for the local community will become a near-term reality for Laguna de Los Micos. ***************** Imagínese sentado en una lancha pequeña en la   en la costa norte de Honduras, a pocos kilómetros al oeste de Tela. Estás disfrutando de un día soleado en la laguna rodeado de verdes manglares, pájaros cantando entre sí y monos jugando entre las ramas. En la distancia, se ve a los pescadores locales ganándose el sustento, lanzando líneas y redes desde la costa con la esperanza de pescar algo. Desafortunadamente, la laguna está bajo la amenaza constante de la sobrepesca por parte de comunidades externas que no cumplen con las normas de pesca locales. A su vez, la sobrepesca provoca una disminución de las poblaciones de peces de arrecife que dependen de las lagunas como criaderos para sus crías. Afortunadamente, el Decreto Ministerial 108-2017 recientemente aprobado está diseñado para proteger esta fuente vital de agua que proporciona alimentos e ingresos a las 13 comunidades circundantes.

Her husband rolls into the water after her and hears Jenny scream. He panics: is she OK? As he swims down to her he also starts to yell but they are both yelling in excitement because—astonishingly—the bottom is covered in live coral. Coral cover has declined across the Caribbean, from near 80 percent in the 1970s to about 18 percent today. Somehow, the corals in Tela have defied that trend: live coral cover is an astounding 69 percent. Now six years later, I have a chance to see these amazing reefs for myself. My own journey to Tela starts with lunch in Miami. No, not that Miami—this is Miami, Honduras: a ragtag collection of wooden houses perched on stilts and crowded onto a narrow strip of sand between the Caribbean Sea and  . This lagoon is an important nursery habitat for many species of reef fish. While Tela’s reefs are amazing for their live coral cover, they have a noticeable lack of fish. This has many worried that the entire local system sits on the edge of an ecological precipice. For these corals to continue to thrive, they need fish—especially herbivorous fish who help control algal growth. However, for the reef to have fish, it needs the lagoon. This lagoon also provides essential food and income for thirteen communities that ring its shores. These communities and others exert enormous fishing pressure on the lagoon, which means very few fish actually survive to make it to the reef. CORAL has been working in Tela for the last four years to reduce overfishing in a way that doesn’t harm the lagoon’s human communities. After my lunch in Miami, Jenny and I pile into a boat on the lagoon with some of Tela’s managers. We are on our way to visit one community— —to see how people, the reef and lagoon interact. My first impression of the lagoon is that it is huge: it takes us forty-five minutes to cross it. Mangroves crowd its shores, their barnacle-clad roots sticking up from water that is bright green and soupy looking. Where the edge is sandy, it is full of birds, including egrets, herons and one pale pink spoonbill. As we near the far shore, there’s a young boy waving at us from a sand bar. He stands next to a tree branch sporting a tattered piece of red fabric, which marks a channel entrance into the forest. The entrance is so shallow that the boat has to be pushed into the channel. We slide over sand past thick reeds that crowd into the boat from both sides. Once we are afloat again, we motor slowly into the forest. The view of mountains is eclipsed by large trees and a deep hot hush settles over us. We step from the boat onto a muddy bank and start our kilometer-long walk through the thick heat to Marion. The first thing I notice when we reach the village is an abandoned house that’s half buried in sand. Marion sits directly under a levee next to a river. In 2014, the levee burst and the village was quickly inundated. Not everyone survived the flood and those who did lost everything. Marion is a poor community without running water or electricity. Yet, as we walk down the wide sandy track through the middle of the village and past the brightly painted school, the feeling is one of happiness and joy. Kids play in the middle of the town, people stop to talk to us. It’s peaceful here. We turn left down a small track toward our final destination. We are greeted by decorative palm fronds and balloons. Balloons! Marion is celebrating the opening of a new cooperative store. A $2,300 micro-grant from CORAL has stocked the shelves with bags of flour, rice and beans, pens and Coca Cola. The store’s profit-sharing agreement provides members with an alternative form of income that helps the community endure the fishing closed season and the reductions in catch limits that will be required to rebuild the ecosystem. The cooperative’s members greet us with smiles and hugs, speeches and more than a few tears of gratitude. Such a small thing for us has made such a big difference for these people. They are still recovering from the flood, and opening this store gives them hope that their community will survive. The next day, I head out to the reef. Rolling into the water, I experience the same thing Jenny did six years earlier. I too am yelling into my regulator in amazement: there is so much coral! Even now, two months after my visit to Tela, picturing those reefs fills me with hope. In Tela, corals have figured out how to adapt to and thrive in less than ideal conditions. By including this area in CORAL’s Mesoamerican   —a large network of diverse and connected healthy reefs—baby corals from Tela can travel to other locations, taking with them the special genetic material that allowed their parents to thrive in murky waters. Communities like Marion also give me hope. Earlier this year,   was passed into law in Tela Bay. This approach to fisheries management ensures that each of Tela’s communities has exclusive access to a portion of the catch. What they don’t fish today will be available to them tomorrow. In conjunction with alternative livelihoods—like the cooperative store in Marion—these communities are able to make decisions to not fish. By including communities in solutions that help save coral reefs, we create win-wins that give everyone hope for the future.   ******************** En el año 2011 Jenny Myton, la Directora Regional de Programa de CORAL para la Región Mesoamericana, está buceando en las aguas turbias de la Bahía de Tela, Honduras. Su esposo se sumerge detrás de ella y escucha a Jenny gritar. Entra en pánico: ¿Estará bien? Al nadar hacia ella, también comienza a gritar, pero ambos gritan de emoción porque, sorprendentemente, el fondo está cubierto de coral vivo. La cobertura de coral ha disminuido en todo el Caribe, de tener cerca del 80 por ciento en la década de 1970 a alrededor del 18 por ciento en la actualidad. De alguna manera, los corales en Tela han desafiado esa tendencia: la cobertura de coral vivo es un asombroso 69 por ciento. Ahora, seis años después, tengo la oportunidad de ver estos increíbles arrecifes por mí mismo. Mi propio viaje a Tela comienza con un almuerzo en Miami. No, no ese Miami, estamos en Miami, Honduras: una colección irregular de casas de madera encaramadas sobre pilotes y apiñadas en una estrecha franja de arena entre el Mar Caribe y la  . Esta laguna es un importante hábitat de cría de muchas especies de peces arrecifales. Si bien los arrecifes de Tela son increíbles por su cobertura de coral vivo, tienen una notable falta de peces. Esto ha causado que muchos se preocupen que todo el sistema local se encuentre al borde de un desastre ecológico. Ya que para que estos corales continúen prosperando, necesitan peces, especialmente peces herbívoros que ayudan a controlar el crecimiento de algas. Sin embargo, para que el arrecife tenga peces, necesita de la laguna. Esta laguna también proporciona alimentos e ingresos esenciales para trece comunidades que rodean sus costas. Estas comunidades y otras ejercen una enorme presión pesquera en la laguna, lo que significa que muy pocos peces sobreviven para llegar al arrecife. CORAL ha estado trabajando en Tela durante los últimos cuatro años para reducir la sobrepesca de una manera que no cause daño a las comunidades de la laguna. Después de mi almuerzo en Miami, Jenny y yo nos subimos a un bote en la laguna con algunos de los gerentes de Tela. Vamos a visitar una comunidad, , para ver cómo interactúan las personas, el arrecife y la laguna. Mi primera impresión de la laguna es que es enorme: tardamos cuarenta y cinco minutos en cruzarla. Los manglares abarrotan sus orillas, sus raíces cubiertas de percebes sobresalen del agua, de color verde brillante y de aspecto viscoso. Donde la orilla es arenosa, está lleno de aves, incluidas garzas, garcetas y un pájaro pico espátula rosa pálido. Cuando nos acercamos a la costa lejana, hay un niño que nos saluda desde un banco de arena. Está de pie junto a la rama de un árbol con un trozo trapo rojo, que marca un canal de entrada al bosque. La entrada es tan poco profunda que hay que empujar el barco hacia el canal. Nos deslizamos sobre la arena entre gruesos juncos que se amontonan en el bote desde ambos lados. Una vez que estamos a flote nuevamente, nos internamos lentamente en el bosque. La vista de las montañas se ve eclipsada por grandes árboles y un profundo silencio se posa sobre nosotros. Salimos del bote a una orilla fangosa y comenzamos nuestra caminata de un kilómetro a través del denso calor hasta Marion. Lo primero que noto al llegar al pueblo es una casa abandonada que está medio enterrada en la arena. Marion está asentada directamente debajo de un bordo al lado de un río. En 2014, el bordo cedió y la aldea se inundó rápidamente. No todos sobrevivieron a la inundación y los que sobrevivieron lo perdieron todo. Marion es una comunidad pobre sin agua corriente ni electricidad. Sin embargo, mientras caminamos por el ancho camino arenoso que atraviesa el centro del pueblo y pasamos por la escuela pintada de colores brillantes, la sensación es de felicidad y alegría. Los niños juegan en el centro del pueblo, la gente se detiene para hablarnos. Este es un lugar tranquilo. Giramos a la izquierda por un pequeño sendero hacia nuestro destino final. Nos reciben hojas de palmera decorativas y globos. ¡Globos! Marion está celebrando la apertura de una nueva tienda cooperativa. Un micro-subsidio de $ 2,300 de CORAL ha llenado los estantes con bolsas de harina, arroz y frijoles, bolígrafos y Coca Cola. El acuerdo participativo en las ganancias de la tienda brinda a los miembros una forma alternativa de ingresos que ayuda a la comunidad a soportar la temporada de veda de pesca y las reducciones en los límites de captura que se requerirán para reconstruir el ecosistema. Los socios de la cooperativa nos saludan con sonrisas y abrazos, discursos y más de una lágrima de gratitud. Algo tan pequeño para nosotros ha marcado una gran diferencia para estas personas. Todavía se están recuperando de la inundación y la apertura de esta tienda les da la esperanza de que su comunidad sobrevivirá. Al día siguiente, me dirijo al arrecife. Al entrar en el agua, experimento lo mismo que Jenny seis años antes. Yo también grito en mi regulador con asombro: ¡hay tanto coral! Incluso ahora, dos meses después de mi visita a Tela, imaginar esos arrecifes me llena de esperanza. En Tela, los corales han encontrado la manera de adaptarse y prosperar en condiciones poco ideales. Al incluir esta zona en el Paisaje Arrecifal Adaptativo Mesoamericano de CORAL -una gran red de arrecifes sanos, diversos y conectados- los corales jóvenes de Tela pueden viajar a otros lugares, llevando consigo el material genético especial que permitió a sus progenitores prosperar en aguas turbias. Comunidades como Marion también me dan esperanza. A principios de este año, la   se convirtió en ley en la Bahía de Tela. Este enfoque de manejo pesquero asegura que cada una de las comunidades de Tela tenga acceso exclusivo a una porción de la captura. Lo que no pescan hoy estará disponible para ellos mañana. Junto con medios de vida alternativos -como la tienda cooperativa de Marion- estas comunidades pueden tomar la decisión de no pescar. Al incluir a las comunidades en las soluciones que contribuyen a salvar los arrecifes de coral, creamos soluciones beneficiosas para todos que dan esperanza al futuro."

        "content": "Coral reefs provide an important source of food and income for coastal and island communities around the world. But more than 55 percent of reefs are threatened by overfishing globally. Overfishing not only disrupts the delicate ecology of coral reefs, it also negatively impacts the local communities that depend on them. If fishers are unable to catch enough fish, they may struggle to make a living or feed their families. That’s where bees and chickens come in. Entrepreneurial “income diversification” projects, like raising egg-laying chickens or keeping honeybees, offer new ways for fishers and their families to earn money. When communities have the skills and resources to generate income in new ways, they don’t need to overfish. The result is a win-win solution, in which people are no longer over-reliant on a single resource, while depleted fish stocks and coral reef ecosystems get the chance to recover and thrive. As part of our   initiative, CORAL collaborates with local communities to develop tailored, locally appropriate income diversification projects. Some such examples include our egg-laying chicken project in coastal Honduras and our beekeeping project in Waivunia, Fiji. We help build the capacity of local people to learn skills like how to run an artisan shop or become a tour guide operator — always taking into consideration communities’ preferences and interests and the availability of materials for start-up and maintenance. One of our greatest success stories comes from the Micos Lagoon on the north coast of Honduras. With its natural beauty and high biodiversity, the lagoon is the ecological, social, and economic heart of Blanca Jeannette Kawas National Park. It serves as a nursery habitat where juvenile reef fish spend their lives before populating Tela Bay’s coral reefs. Unfortunately, water pollution, overfishing, and unsustainable fishing practices (like using fishing nets with illegal mesh sizes) have caused overexploitation of the lagoon. In July 2017, Micos lagoon experienced a number of hypoxic events that devastated the food chain, leaving more than 500 fishers and their families without their usual income. Shortly thereafter, CORAL began work with the fishing community of Los Cerritos to create an egg-laying hen project. We partnered with a cooperative of 12 women who are either fishers themselves or married to fishers, and gave them a microgrant for the purchase of 120 egg-laying hens. After a year of construction, learning, and trial and error, the hens are now providing an alternative source of protein for the community and helping them adapt to new fishing regulations and changing environmental conditions (e.g. hypoxic events) in the lagoon. Income diversification activities like this one not only reduce fishing pressure but also engender goodwill and increase compliance with local fishing regulations. Together with scientific monitoring, enforcement patrols, sustainable policies, and education, they are a highly valuable conservation strategy for people and reefs. *************** Los arrecifes de coral proporcionan una importante fuente de alimentos e ingresos para las comunidades costeras e insulares de todo el mundo. Pero más del 55 por ciento de los arrecifes están amenazados por la sobrepesca a nivel mundial. La sobrepesca no solo altera la delicada ecología de los arrecifes de coral, sino que también afecta negativamente a las comunidades locales que dependen de ellos. Si los pescadores no pueden obtener suficientes peces, pueden tener dificultades para ganarse la vida o alimentar a sus familias. Aquí es donde entran en juego las abejas y los pollos. Los proyectos empresariales de “diversificación de ingresos”, como la cría de gallinas ponedoras o la cría de abejas, ofrecen nuevas formas para que los pescadores y sus familias ganen dinero. Cuando las comunidades tienen las habilidades y los recursos para generar ingresos de nuevas maneras, no necesitan pescar en exceso. El resultado es una solución en la que todos salimos ganando y en la que las personas dejan de depender en exceso de un único recurso, al tiempo que las poblaciones de peces ya agotadas y los ecosistemas de los arrecifes de coral tienen la oportunidad de recuperarse y prosperar. Como parte de nuestra iniciativa de  , CORAL colabora con las comunidades locales para desarrollar proyectos de diversificación de ingresos adaptados y localmente apropiados. Algunos de estos ejemplos incluyen nuestro proyecto de gallinas ponedoras en la costa de Honduras y nuestro proyecto de apicultura en Waivunia, Fiji. Ayudamos a capacitar a la población local para que aprenda a administrar una tienda de artesanías o a convertirse en operador de guías turísticos, siempre teniendo en cuenta las preferencias e intereses de las comunidades y la disponibilidad de materiales para su puesta en funcionamiento y mantenimiento. Una de nuestras mayores historias de éxito viene de la Laguna de Micos en la costa norte de Honduras. Con su belleza natural y alta biodiversidad, la laguna es el corazón ecológico, social y económico del Parque Nacional Blanca Jeannette Kawas. Sirve como hábitat de cría donde los peces arrecifales juveniles pasan su vida antes de poblar los arrecifes de coral de la Bahía de Tela. Desafortunadamente, la contaminación del agua, la sobrepesca y las prácticas de pesca insostenibles (como el uso de redes de pesca con tamaños de malla ilegales) han provocado la sobreexplotación de la laguna. En julio de 2017, la laguna de Los Micos experimentó una serie de eventos hipóxicos que devastaron la cadena alimentaria, dejando a más de 500 pescadores y sus familias sin sus ingresos habituales. Poco tiempo después, CORAL comenzó a trabajar con la comunidad pesquera de Los Cerritos para crear un proyecto de gallinas ponedoras. Nos asociamos con una cooperativa de 12 mujeres que son pescadoras o están casadas con pescadores, y les dimos una micro subvención para la compra de 120 gallinas ponedoras. Tras un año de construcción, aprendizaje y ensayo y error, las gallinas son ahora una fuente alternativa de proteínas para la comunidad y les ayudan a adaptarse a las nuevas normas de pesca y a los cambios en las condiciones ambientales (por ejemplo, los eventos hipóxicos) en la laguna. Las actividades de diversificación de ingresos como esta no solo reducen la presión pesquera, sino que también generan buena voluntad y aumentan el cumplimiento de las normas pesqueras locales. Junto con el monitoreo científico, el patrullaje de vigilancia, las políticas sostenibles y la educación, constituyen una estrategia de conservación muy valiosa para las personas y los arrecifes."

But among the goblins, ghosts, and creepy clowns, here at CORAL, there’s a different type of beast that truly spooks us—climate change.  Sure, climate change doesn’t look like a typical monster. It doesn’t have fangs like a vampire or howl like a werewolf. But climate change is real and more terrifying than anything you’ll encounter on Halloween night. In fact, it’s threatening our planet each and every day. Climate change is responsible for an increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, a dramatic rise in sea level, and a devastating decline in biodiversity. It contributes to food insecurity and impacts human health. And for our beautiful, valuable coral reefs—warming ocean temperatures threaten their existence entirely. That’s why at CORAL, we’ve turned science into action and committed to helping coral reefs adapt to a changing climate.   in a temperature range of 73° to 84° F, and most corals are living close to their upper thermal limit. When ocean waters are too warm, in addition to direct threats like overfishing or water pollution, corals get stressed. In reaction to the stress, hard corals expel small, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in the coral tissue and act as their primary food source. Without zooxanthellae, corals get sick and enter a “bleached state.” Their notably bright, vibrant colors turn to ghostly white, and if left bleached for too long, they will die.  According to a   released by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, large scale coral bleaching events—caused by climate change—are the greatest disturbance to reefs. In fact, these events have contributed to the loss of at least 14 percent of the world’s corals in the last decade. Corals have survived for a long time and are known for their resilience. Research shows that corals can adapt to a changing climate if we slow down emissions and reduce local stressors.  In contribution to a worldwide effort, we’re partnering with  , a comprehensive map and monitoring system of the world’s shallow water coral reefs. This new, innovative tool uses satellites to detect coral bleaching in real time—which will be a vital resource to push policies and take urgent, necessary action.  Andrea Rivera-Sosa, CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager, is contributing to the project by working with a global network of field scientists, who will get into the water during a bleaching event to verify what the satellites are detecting in space. “Climate change is a serious issue affecting coral reefs,” says Rivera-Sosa. “This tool provides evidence of bleaching that we hope can be leveraged to decision makers to help reduce the impacts of climate change at the global scale.”  In addition to this worldwide effort, we are also working at the local level to mitigate direct threats to reefs, which make it harder for corals to adapt to climate change. This includes addressing overfishing and minimizing pollutants that enter ocean waters.  There’s no question about it—we have a lot of work to do. Governments,  , and  all need to take urgent action, or risk losing the world’s most valuable and vulnerable ecosystem.  So this Halloween, don’t fret about those silly zombies, witches, and killer robots. Instead,   as we face the scariest monster of them all—climate change.  "

It is well documented that climate change is causing corals to die off at an unprecedented rate, but our study provides tools that offer promise for their survival. Our results show that when evolution is enabled, conservation efforts can help corals adapt to rising temperatures.” -Dr. Madhavi Colton, co-author and Program Director at the Coral Reef Alliance. Predictions about the future of coral reefs that don’t include adaptation paint a grim picture of the consequences of climate change, predicting that rising temperatures could result in a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Our results, however, suggest that management and evolution together can help corals adapt to rising temperatures. The study found that the likelihood of successful adaptation increases if local threats to reefs are reduced through effective management. Effectively managing reefs includes protecting them from overfishing and water pollution, which improves local conditions for corals. Managed areas serve as sources of repopulation over the long term–corals in managed areas rescue the rest of the reef. Importantly, the diversity-based conservation strategies performed well under a variety of assumptions and future conditions. This demonstrates that we know enough of the science to act now to establish spatial management networks that include a diversity of reef types and habitats. With the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste. The study shows that managing reefs to facilitate evolution today and, in the future, can enhance their chances of long-term survival. Managing reefs to facilitate evolution means creating networks of coral reefs where local stressors are reduced and a diversity of coral types and habitats are protected. Conservation planners can facilitate adaptation even in the face of ongoing and unpredictable change by prioritizing diversity in coral traits and habitats. Our models suggest that this is the best chance of helping reefs deal with climate change. “The study shows that we know enough of the science to act- and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste.” -Dr. Colton   The research group is currently developing next-generation models that incorporate network connectivity patterns, using real-world data from the Pacific, Coral Triangle and Caribbean to develop regional conservation plans.

Troubled by warming ocean temperatures and mass coral bleaching events, we launched the Modeling Adaptation Potential (MAP) Project in 2016 to ask a critical question: Can coral reefs adapt to and survive the warming temperatures of climate change? To answer this question, CORAL assembled some of the top experts in coral reef ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation science to figure out if corals can adapt to life on a warming planet and what we can do to help. Scientists from Rutgers University, the University of Washington, the University of Queensland and Stanford came together under CORAL’s leadership to analyze how different conservation solutions perform through time using a suite of mathematical models. The group used models to predict how corals cope with different management strategies and scenarios, as it allowed them to quickly analyze the results instead of waiting for results from live samples. The initial results of the MAP Project were published in the scientific journal   in July 2019, and provide hope for coral reefs by showing that, with the right approaches to conservation, we can help corals evolve to endure rising temperatures. The group found that conservation actions like reducing water pollution and overfishing can help coral health so that they’re better able to take the heat. Many of these solutions can be implemented immediately– and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste. Today we’re acting swiftly by leading the MAP Project team to create actionable conservation guidelines that will be used around the world. CORAL is already using these guidelines to create  , and we recently hosted the MAP Science Advisory Group meeting in Roatán, Honduras to synthesize research into regional coral reef management plans for the Caribbean, Pacific, and Coral Triangle.   to determine where and how to implement their coral restoration efforts to achieve their goal of restoring one million corals across the Caribbean. By partnering with scientists, conservation organizations, and local reef managers, we’re promoting adaptation as a solution for coral reefs and turning science into action to save coral reefs for generations to come."

        "content": "New results from our pioneering research show that protecting reefs that thrive in warmer waters may be key to helping evolution rescue reefs from the effects of climate change. For the last several years, we’ve been leading research funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and other funders to understand how we can best help coral reefs adapt to climate change. Research by others has already shown that corals have some capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change. But we wanted to know more about how the process of adaptation might unfold over centuries of global warming, so that we could turn that science into action today. What could we do to help this process along? To answer these questions, we partnered with academic researchers to build simulations of reefs and we used them to test how different strategies for protecting coral reefs perform over time. Which strategies were the best at protecting reefs long term? In our first paper published in   in 2019, we reported the need to protect a diversity of coral reefs from local stressors—like overfishing and water pollution. Using our simulations, we’ve been exploring what “diversity” means using real-world data from the Caribbean, Southwest Pacific, and Coral Triangle regions. Our results show that thermal diversity is really important. Our models show that networks of protected areas that include reefs in warmer waters tend to fare better over time. The best explanation is that these reefs contain corals that have already figured out how to thrive in warmer conditions. When these corals reproduce, they send their heat-adapted larvae (baby corals) to other reefs, helping areas across a region cope with rising temperatures. There is one important caveat: these results are based on the assumption that we curb global carbon emissions. If we don’t reduce the amount of warming our planet experiences, even heat-adapted corals will struggle to survive. Now that the research phase of this project is complete, we are turning our attention to translating these findings into action. These results can help us identify the areas that need to be better protected—because in some parts of the world, relatively few “hot” reefs are in marine protected areas. With these new results, we’re in a better position to encourage the establishment and improved management of protected area networks that will help coral reefs adapt to climate change."

Whether you reside on the coast or live hundreds of miles inland, World Oceans Day is a time for everybody to celebrate and learn how ocean health contributes to the overall health of our planet.  Why are our oceans important? It’s a valid question. Afterall, humans live on land…so why should we care about the health of our oceans and seas?  Besides the fact that oceans are home to countless marine species, they also greatly contribute to the health of animals that live on land and provide many benefits to humans. According to the  , the ocean produces more than 50 percent of the planet’s oxygen and it regulates our climate and weather patterns. We also rely on the ocean to transport goods, and it contributes to the worldwide economy through tourism, food, and other industries. Not to mention, communities across the globe rely on fish for protein and ocean ingredients used to make modern medicine.  Despite all of these incredible benefits, climate change and human impacts are causing our oceans’ health to rapidly diminish and deteriorate. That’s why we, at CORAL, are calling on you to help us protect the ocean this World Oceans Day. At CORAL, we focus on protecting coral reefs, which are unquestionably some of the most valuable underwater ecosystems.  It’s estimated that roughly 25 percent of all marine life depends on coral reefs, with species ranging from sea turtles to parrotfish to reef sharks. They also provide food, economic value, and shoreline protection to coastal communities. One major way you can protect the ocean this World Oceans Day is by taking actions that focus on keeping coral reefs healthy. "

Coral reefs depend on fish like parrotfish and surgeonfish to consume seaweeds (also called macroalgae) and prevent them from overgrowing and smothering coral reefs. Entrepreneurial projects, like creating handicrafts to sell to tourists or raising egg-laying chickens, offer new ways for fishers and their families to earn money. When communities have the skills and resources to generate income in new ways, the result is a win-win solution, in which people are no longer as reliant on a single resource for their livelihood, while depleted fish stocks and coral reef ecosystems get the chance to recover and thrive.

In these uncertain times, ecotourism—a major source of income for many coral reef destinations—has been severely affected. With tourism revenue temporarily gone, many coral reef communities around the world are turning to overfishing to feed their families. But in the communities where CORAL works, our work to build the resilience of local communities is paying off. Thanks to our work on income diversification, as well as governance and capacity building, these communities are stronger and better able to withstand the unknown. One example of this is our work in the Bay Islands of Honduras, where we have been working with local communities to diversify their skillsets and sources of income. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, CORAL and partners hosted a series of workshops to build the capacity of the Association of Artisans of Roatán, Utila and Guanaja. The artisan women that comprise the Association are already skilled in many handicrafts, such as knitting, sewing, painting and jewelry making. Through the workshops, they added to their repertoire by learning bookbinding—a skill which will allow them to create new products to appeal to tourists and visitors. In addition to diversifying the handicrafts available for sale in Roatán, this workshop also promotes best practices like creating crafts using sustainable materials that do not harm protected species or undermine their cultural heritage. While the coronavirus pandemic has caused an unexpected halt to tourism operations, the women of the association continue to practice their craft and develop their skills under shelter-in-place. The bookbinding workshop was led by Arleth Rivera, a Honduran graduate of the National School of Fine Arts who specializes in book restoration and bookbinding. Ms. Rivera is now offering an online course via Facebook Live and Instagram, which will enable the women to continue their learning and training from the safety of their homes. We are also exploring the potential of marketing and selling the women’s products online. Just like coral reefs, human communities who have the ability to shift and adapt in times of crisis will stand strong—and even thrive—when faced with shocks and stresses. The steps we take today to build community and reef resilience will ensure their survival in the future. We at CORAL are proud of the work we do to help our mutually dependent human and ecological systems become resilient to the complex challenges of our time."

Sounds dreamy, doesn’t it? And for Dr. Antonella Rivera, Principal Investigator for the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) in Honduras, part of that is true. She does get to visit beautiful tropical environments  . And she occasionally gets to snorkel and dive. But the majority of her days are spent studying something that is entirely NOT romantic:  . Dr. Rivera’s work focuses on the world’s second largest coral reef ecosystem—the Mesoamerican Reef. The Mesoamerican Reef stretches about 700 miles along the coasts of México, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and supports millions of people with food, income and coastal protection. In a typical year, it attracts nearly 16 million tourists to the region, bringing much needed revenue—though that came to a standstill in March 2020 when the global pandemic hit. Despite these obvious benefits, the Mesoamerican Reef is currently listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List—largely due to coastal pollution. Lack of proper and efficient wastewater management in the region often means sewage enters the ocean untreated. As you can imagine, sewage in the ocean poses a serious public health threat, putting a significant strain on the tourism industry. In some cases, tourists have sued hotels, claiming the contaminated waters and beaches made them sick. But the sewage also poses a serious threat to coral reefs. “It’s heartbreaking that every year we’re seeing more and more algae on the reef,” says Dr. Rivera. “It’s obvious that sewage pollution is a big problem in the region, but we just haven’t had the data on a regional scale to prove that.” , it brings nutrients that spur the growth of algae. The algae interfere with coral growth and compete with corals for space, and when that is combined with overfishing and the loss of herbivores who feed on the algae, the algae can quickly overcome the outnumbered corals. The sewage also contributes to coral disease, further stressing the reef. There are few efforts in the region to monitor water quality and better understand the cause and effects of sewage pollution. At CORAL, we have a robust   on the island of Roatán in Honduras that started seven years ago. But at a regional level, data collection is patchy and site-specific, and there’s no platform or organized effort to tell the full story of what’s really happening on the Mesoamerican Reef as a whole. Until now. When tourism came to a standstill in early 2020, Dr. Rivera and the rest of the CORAL team saw it as an opportunity. The low levels of tourism provided the perfect chance to understand the effects that visitors have on the inadequate or non-existent wastewater treatment systems in the region. We quickly partnered with the  ,  , and local partners to launch a regional water quality monitoring program and build upon some of the more local efforts that are already happening. The first phase of the program will explore the effects of tourism on water quality. The team will begin collecting monthly water quality samples in the next few weeks at three major tourism-impacted locations in each country, using parameters that will help quantify the impacts of tourism. As tourists begin to return to the region, the team expects to see a drastic change in water quality. The second phase will explore the effects of other pollution contributors, like agriculture, and will use these data to begin advocating for policy changes. Though Dr. Rivera never anticipated this kind of potty talk would consume her days as a coral reef scientist, she couldn’t be more excited to be diving in. “I’m excited about this new water quality work because it’s a way for us to scale up all the good work we are doing in Roatán,” says Dr. Rivera. “It makes me very optimistic that water quality, and its impact on coastal ecosystems, will finally be on the forefront of research and conservation in the region. We’ll be able to make a considerable impact on reef health.”"

        "content": "We all depend on coral reefs. To most, this may seem like an exaggeration, but coral reefs are vital to the livelihoods of more than 500 million people for food, income, and protection from storms and waves. They support approximately six million fishers and are important culturally to many indigenous people.  While you may assume that coral reefs are thriving as millions of people depend on and care for them, in reality, they are threatened by a combination of stressors. In fact, about 75% of the world’s coral reefs are threatened.  There are many global threats to corals such as coral bleaching, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. Primarily, the increasing amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has caused coral bleaching. When water temperatures rise too high, corals expel their zooxanthellae, tiny algae that live inside coral tissue and act as a food source. Corals can survive this event, but they become more prone to disease and can die if bleaching persists. Unfortunately, coral bleaching is increasing as corals are exposed to high levels of carbon dioxide.  In addition, many locations do not treat their wastewater, which can increase algal growth and nutrient pollution.  Ocean acidification also plays a major factor in threatening coral reefs. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide, gradually making the ocean more acidic. Reef-building corals (hard corals) are negatively affected, altering their ability to grow their skeleton and make the foundation for coral reefs. This makes corals more prone to disease and destruction.  These are only some of the threats to coral reefs. Other direct threats to coral reefs include unsustainable fishing, habitat destruction, and land-based pollution.  Even small actions can make an impact. Here are some ways we protect coral reefs:  1. Use reef-friendly sunscreen 2. Reduce your energy consumption: turn off lights when leaving the house or use public transportation  3. Dive responsibly: admire reefs from a distance and avoid touching them 4. Eat sustainable seafood  5. Recycle and dispose of trash correctly  6. Subscribe to the   to learn about their conservation efforts and what you can do to help 7. Support coral-friendly businesses 8. Help spread the word about coral reefs by sharing CORAL’s content on  Another important thing each of us can do to help coral reefs is to educate others on the importance of coral reefs to the ocean and to us.  We can inspire others to develop a love and care for the ocean and coral reefs.  In the words of Jacques Cousteau:   If people begin to love and appreciate coral reefs, they may be encouraged to take small steps in conserving them!"

Hawaiʻi Wai Ola’s diverse set of members includes: Hawaiʻi Wai Ola is harnessing the power of citizen science to provide a more comprehensive and timely understanding of Hawaii’s water quality, and thus, quality of life. Citizen science groups are becoming increasingly prevalent across Hawaiʻi, as government and community groups recognize their many benefits. Citizen scientists provide a cost-effective solution for increasing the amount of high-quality rigorous data that researchers are able to collect. Citizen science also increases public awareness and empowers people to make a difference for their island community. CORAL has been proudly leading its own citizen science program on Hawaiʻi Island. In 2017, CORAL began training citizen scientists in Puakō to conduct monthly water quality sampling of six sites along the South Kohala shore, as part of a broader plan to monitor the Puakō reef before, during, and after the transition away from cesspools to cleaner alternatives (learn more about our Clean Water for Reefs Puakō project  ). Our citizen science group collects data on metrics like temperature, bacteria (e.g. Enterococcus) and nutrients; information which is critical to understanding ocean health for the benefit of Hawaiʻi’s residents, visitors and ecosystems. Now, thanks to the establishment of the Hawaiʻi Wai Ola, much-needed water quality monitoring is now expanding across Hawaiʻi Island. Data collected will be provided to the Hawaiʻi State Department of Health (DOH), filling critical gaps in their database. Data will also be made publicly available on the  , which we encourage you to explore. If you’re based in Hawaiʻi, please consider joining the new   or our  !"

        "content": "Together with our partners, we trained nearly 130 tourism operators on best practices for coral reef conservation throughout México, Belize and Honduras this year. Each year, about 22 million people visit Quintana Roo, México. The Caribbean coastline offers beautiful clear blue waters, white sand beaches, and easy access to the second-largest reef system in the world—the Mesoamerican Reef. The tourism industry takes a heavy toll on the nearshore reefs. But with our local partners, Amigos de Sian Ka’an and Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, or CONANP), we’re working to build a more sustainable tourism industry. Together, we’re training tourism operators throughout the region on sustainable practices and ways to protect coral reefs. Our partners provide tourism operators with tools on how to work within marine protected areas and how to improve business models as sustainable tourism operators. The trainings used to be in person, but with COVID-19 they are now all virtual. And the virtual format is working—at the September workshop, the fifth workshop in 12 months, nearly 25 tourism operators joined. This year alone we’ve trained nearly 130 tourism operators in Quintana Roo, Belize and Honduras. The workshop follows a train-the-trainer format, so participants learn how to bring what they learn back to their communities and help educate others and create lasting change. Many tourism operators know their marine environment like the back of their hand—but they don’t always understand the resource they rely on. This training is often their first formal introduction to coral reefs and why they’re important. “I’ve been working all these years on the reef, and I always just thought they were rocks and I could step on them and nothing would happen,” says Victor Barreda, one of the participants at the September training. Victor used to be a fisher, but with fish resources becoming more and more scarce and unreliable, he now runs a tourism operation in Quintana Roo. “Thanks to this presentation, now I know.” These trainings not only build a more sustainable tourism industry, but they also help us build a local network of coral reef supporters and partners. These partners will be instrumental down the line in helping us reduce other threats to reefs, like overfishing and poor water quality."

When COVID-19 hit, 10-year-old Abby Rogers was looking for a way to help protect the environment. As a newly certified SCUBA diver, the Maui resident could now see the beautiful underwater world first hand, and her passion for the underwater world was growing. That’s when her mom heard about CORAL’s new volunteer opportunity: growing native plants from home to help protect coral reefs. In West Maui, we rely on our dedicated volunteers and partners to help us restore degraded agricultural lands and stream beds. We use native plants to revegetate the area and trap sediment and nutrients that would otherwise run into the ocean and smother coral reefs. But when our volunteer planting days were canceled in late March, we had to pivot. We started recruiting volunteers to grow native plants at home and hang on to them until a CORAL team member could retrieve them and transplant them, or until it was safe for the volunteer to visit the restoration site and plant them. When Abby signed up, she originally decided to start with three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But she quickly realized how much fun it was—she enjoyed taking breaks from distance learning to check on her plants on her patio—and she soon signed up for 15 more kits, bringing her total to 900 native plants. Abby is one of over 100 volunteers who are helping us grow over 25,000 native plant seeds. Since not all seeds will germinate, we anticipate having about 10,000 plants to ultimately transplant at our restoration site. Not only has the project helped us recruit more volunteers who are spreading the word about coral reef conservation, but it also allowed us to save the money we would have otherwise spent on purchasing native plants from a nursery."

        "content": "Our three community scientists in Honduras brought improved fishing practices to the Mesoamerican Reef by building important relationships with fishers. Paola Urrutia, Greissi Lizeth Villatoro, and Ana Bessy Valdez spend their days building relationships with fishers. As our community scientists in Honduras, they travel every morning to popular fisher landing points and meet with the fishers to analyze their catch. They take measurements, ask for anecdotal data, and document all of their findings. The data they collect give us and our partners more insight into local fisheries. They also help local fishers understand what’s happening to their underwater resources. Urrutia, Villatoro, and Valdez are respected members of the communities where they work. They participate in community meetings and report back on their findings. Through their relationships, they’ve created a network of fishers that help support science and understand the importance of rules and regulations. When Urrutia started, 100% of local fishers fished during the closed season. But now, only 10-20% fish illegally. Likewise, Villatoro has noticed that the local crabbing company has stopped buying small, juvenile crabs and fishers have stopped using illegal nets that are more likely to catch younger crabs. All three of our community scientists are women from minority groups who are socially and economically vulnerable. The position of community scientist at CORAL not only provides them with a stable income, but our program coordinators also support them in working toward personal goals and pursuing their education. Urrutia for example, was a community scientist in 2016 before leaving to go back to school. Now that she has graduated, she has returned to CORAL and has taken on more duties. She’s now also supervising the maintenance and data collection from CORAL’s experimental aquaculture project in Tela—a project designed to create an economic alternative for fishers."

        "content": "We created a network of partners on Hawai‘i Island to launch a robust, volunteer-based water quality testing program and began monitoring sites around the island. In 2018, CORAL began building a local group on Hawai‘i Island to monitor water quality. Since then, Hawai‘i Wai Ola has grown to consist of eleven different organizations, volunteer community members, and scientists who champion water quality issues on Hawai‘i Island. The group’s plan was to launch a volunteer team this summer that would regularly collect water quality samples in Kona, Hilo and South Kohala. Their efforts would bring a more robust and consistent understanding of water quality issues across Hawai‘i Island and gather data that could help inform policy and spur action within the local government. Early this year, they   and started building a targeted communications campaign to recruit volunteers. But when COVID-19 hit, the volunteer program was put on hold and in-person training was canceled. As case numbers continued to rise on the island, it became near impossible to allow groups of volunteers to gather in a safe manner to sample, let alone to be trained. Led by CORAL’s Hawai‘i Island Program Manager Erica Perez, the team quickly pivoted so as to not lose momentum. They began converting their volunteer training program into a digital format so they could still train volunteers. And by June, they had started collecting water quality samples on their own without volunteers. They were able to collect three-months-worth of data at 16 sites around the island before the beaches closed in September, and now that beaches have reopened, they’ll be able to collect two more months of data before the end of the year. The data collected between June and September are a blessing in disguise—the islands were closed to tourists during that time and very few people were using beaches. The low-use period will give us an opportunity to understand what water quality looks like without tourists, an opportunity we wouldn’t have had if 2020 hadn’t presented so many challenges."

        "content": "Do you smell that? It’s the stench of rotting eggs…lingering for half a mile inland from the Caribbean shoreline. It’s a stinky reality of this year’s sargassum bloom, or in other words, the overload of seaweed that is washing up on beaches in parts of Mexico, Honduras, Belize, and other nearby areas.   is a seaweed that floats across the ocean in large island-like masses. While floating, the sargassum has many benefits and provides shelter and food for marine life. But once the mass strikes land, it starts to decompose.  While sargassum blooms are a natural occurrence, climate change and direct human impact have led to an explosion of new nutrient-dense seaweed, all accumulating on the beaches in the Mesoamerican Region. The seaweed grows in the Amazon River area and continues to bloom and move with the current, until arriving in the Caribbean. The combination of increased dust blown westward from mining and desertification in the Sahara, mixed with the fertilizer runoff in the Amazon, and overall warming temperatures has led to the perfect conditions for blooming seaweed.  “The seaweed grows quickly,” says Javier Pizaña-Alonso, CORAL’s Program Manager in Cozumel.  “Under these perfect conditions, blooms can double in size in about 18 days. It can become an issue, depending on how long the blooms drift in the ocean.”  Excess of nutrients found in the seaweed doesn’t just smell bad—it also threatens the health of coastal marine environments. The seaweed is rich in nitrogen, sulfur, ammonium, and heavy metals due to excess fertilizer runoff in the Amazon River, which is a result of rainforest deforestation and increased agriculture. “When the sargassum washes up on shore, it degrades and creates a brown tide. This impacts water quality,” says Pizaña-Alonso. Poor water quality is dangerous for animals in the ocean, including our coral reef ecosystems. , there is potential for excessive algae growth, which can quickly take over reef-building corals and destroy the home of more than one million marine species. Furthermore, too much sargassum can smother coral reefs that are close to the shoreline and impact the habits of other animals. And the environmental impact isn’t the only concern. Too much sargassum may also affect the local economy in Mesoamerica, which relies heavily on tourism. “Travelers don’t like the smell and it affects our beautiful beaches,” says Pizaña-Alonso.  There are a lot of factors involved when it comes to solving the sargassum problem. According to Pizaña-Alonso, in Quintana Roo, the navy is trying to collect the seaweed before it comes to shore. Meanwhile, in other affected areas, like Roatan, Honduras, the government has defined a task force and different sectors are advocating for a state of emergency, which will allow for additional funds to be used to address the situation. Despite some controversy, there is also research and testing to see if it is safe to recycle the sargassum. Some are proposing to turn parts of the seaweed into animal feed or mulch. There’s even been experimentation with the idea of using sargassum to make low income homes, notebooks or shoes.   As a next step, Pizaña-Alonso, would love to get involved with the government’s efforts and offer his expertise in marine science. He is also urging governments, corporations, and individuals to learn about this problem and why it is occurring in the first place. By simply lowering our carbon footprint and advocating for the elimination of destructive tactics, like deforestation and mining, we allow for a more balanced planet, and ocean for all. "

This natural wonderland is an essential breeding ground for several endangered species of marine life, including sea turtles, manatees, and American crocodiles, and plays a crucial role in preserving the region’s biodiversity. In addition to its ecological value, the lagoon is also a vital source of livelihood for local communities, serving as a major fishing ground that provides them with a source of food and income. At CORAL, we recognize the critical importance of preserving and conserving Micos Lagoon, not just for the benefit of the region’s wildlife but also for the prosperity of the people who rely on it. That’s why we’re thrilled to announce that together, with our local partners, we were able to establish the area as the first of its kind, a marine/coastal territorial use right system. This groundbreaking step means that we can regulate and monitor artisanal fishing activities in the region more effectively, ensuring that they are sustainable and do not harm the fragile ecosystem of the lagoon. We’re proud to say that our efforts have already yielded results.  . At CORAL, we remain committed to our mission of preserving and protecting the world’s coral reefs and the communities that depend on them, and we look forward to continuing our work at Micos Lagoon and beyond. We are proud to share that our recent efforts to promote sustainable artisanal fisheries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) were highlighted in a featured publication, “ ” (Communities with a voice: The future of artisanal fishing in LAC). Artisanal and subsistence fishing in LAC is critical to the region, but historically, sustainable management has been a challenge. To address this issue, there has been a global trend towards managing the fishing sector through adaptive partnerships. These experiences highlight the importance of collective decision-making and community-led efforts for the conservation and sustainable management of fish resources. Our work seeks to inspire and promote co-management systems that prioritize the rights of fishers and the sustainability of fish resources in LAC. By sharing positive experiences and adaptive learning processes, we hope to empower fishing communities to take an active role in the governance of their countries and the preservation of their valuable resources. We are planning to continue monitoring and patrolling the lagoon to update the ministerial decree using science-based adaptive management.

        "content": "Around the world, sewage pollutes oceans, harms coral reefs, and threatens our health. But it doesn’t have to.  By connecting homes, businesses, and tourist facilities to community-supported wastewater treatment plants, we can significantly reduce the amount of harmful pollutants discharged into the ocean.  These systems remove contaminants that contribute to coral bleaching, disease, and reef degradation.   Additionally, community education and government collaboration play crucial roles in maintaining these systems and promoting sustainable practices. Through these combined efforts, we can protect and preserve coral reefs for future generations.    will have outsized impacts on our precious ocean ecosystems. Saving coral reefs with wastewater solutions has clear, tangible impacts, which is why we’re focusing our efforts on expanding this work. Keep reading for ten ways properly treated wastewater can revolutionize reef and community health. This may seem obvious, but it’s worth overstating.  Science tells us corals can adapt to a warmer ocean if they have clean water and healthy fish populations. Contaminants and pathogens in untreated wastewater can lead to increased stress and susceptibility to disease in corals. Wastewater infrastructure helps reduce or even eliminate pollutants and contaminants in the ocean, improving overall water quality. Providing clean water to these areas can help prevent coral bleaching and disease, allowing corals to grow and thrive. Clean water ensures a healthier environment for coral growth and resilience, and the benefits of this are invaluable. Not only does supporting a diverse range of marine species enhance the entire ecosystem, but it’s also a major pillar in climate adaptation. Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine life, and clean water helps maintain the delicate balance required for these ecosystems to flourish. Healthier reefs lead to more abundant fish populations, benefiting corals and local fishing industries. Coral reefs provide essential habitats for many fish species, and cleaner water supports their breeding and feeding grounds. Who wants to swim in dirty water? No one.  Pristine reefs attract more tourists to coastal communities, boosting local economies reliant on diving, snorkeling, and beach activities. Clean water ensures that coral reefs remain vibrant and appealing to visitors, promoting sustainable tourism. Cleaner water means safer, more enjoyable beaches for swimming and recreation. Reducing the contaminants that reach coastal areas ensures that beaches remain inviting and free from health hazards. Reducing exposure to waterborne diseases drastically improves public health in coastal communities. Proper wastewater treatment prevents the spread of pathogens that can cause serious illnesses in humans.Did we mention 80% of coastal communities don’t have properly treated wastewater?  Sustaining livelihoods dependent on marine resources and tourism promotes economic resilience. Healthy coral reefs support industries such as fishing and tourism, which are vital to the economies of many coastal communities. They also act as natural barriers against storm surges and erosion, preventing the destruction of coastal properties and loss of land and saving money on coastal defense measures. Healthy reefs play a crucial role in carbon sequestration by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide through calcification. Corals and other reef-building organisms use carbon to form calcium carbonate structures, which make up the reef. This process helps mitigate the impacts of climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Additionally, the dense and diverse ecosystems supported by coral reefs contribute to the overall carbon storage capacity of marine environments, enhancing their role in global carbon cycling and climate regulation. Wastewater treatment plants and processes create avenues for environmental education and awareness to help foster a culture of conservation and sustainable practices. Clean water initiatives provide opportunities to educate the public about the importance of protecting coral reefs and the role of wastewater treatment in maintaining ocean health. Clean water is essential for the survival of all things, especially coral reefs and the overall health of our oceans. By addressing wastewater issues, we directly impact the preservation of these vital ecosystems. Join us on our journey to better wastewater management by supporting our Clean Water for Reefs campaign and help us protect the future of coral reefs.   and be a part of the solution."

        "content": "How do we decide where to focus our efforts in saving coral reefs? It’s a question we get asked a lot, and the answer is both strategic and deeply rooted in our mission.  So let’s get into it!   – climate adaptation needs, local leadership and partnerships, and the resource needs of communities. First and foremost,   Coral reefs are more than just beautiful underwater landscapes; they are interconnected ecosystems that rely on ocean currents to transport coral larvae from one reef to another. This natural process creates resilient networks capable of adapting to climate change. Take the islands of   (Maui, Lanai, and Molokai) in Hawaii, for example. These islands are connected by ocean currents that allow coral, fish, and invertebrate larvae to travel between them, seeding neighboring reefs. This interconnectedness is the backbone of our strategy, helping us design marine protected areas that support each other and enhance overall coral reef conservation. Our second consideration is the presence of local leaders who are willing to partner with us. Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We work with community leaders, non-profits, and local governments who understand the importance of coral reef conservation and are eager to implement sustainable practices. These partnerships are essential for promoting  and ensuring the long-term success of our conservation efforts. When communities invite us to the table and seek our expertise, it creates a powerful synergy. Together, we can develop and implement strategies that protect marine environments while benefiting local populations. It’s about working hand-in-hand with those who know and love their reefs best, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in conservation efforts. Finally, we focus on areas where coral reefs are in urgent need of intervention and the communities lack the necessary resources to protect them. Many regions around the world struggle with limited infrastructure and funding to effectively manage their marine ecosystems. By concentrating our efforts on these under-resourced areas, we provide the   needed to restore and preserve vulnerable coral reefs. This commitment to working in developing countries highlights our dedication to addressing the most pressing challenges in coral reef conservation. It’s about leveling the playing field and ensuring that even the most threatened reefs have a fighting chance. “Where do you work?” is a multifaceted question for our organization because our impact spans local, regional, and global scales. Here’s a closer look at the different levels of our involvement: In the  , we have staff on the ground working directly on conservation initiatives. For example, the Palancar Reef in Cozumel and the Cordelia Banks in Honduras are just two critical sites where we focus our efforts. These reefs are vital to the local marine ecosystem and economy, and our work helps ensure their health and resilience. In  , our team works on islands like Maui and Molokai, where reefs like Olowalu and South Molokai are key to the region’s biodiversity and coastal protection. These reefs face numerous threats, from climate change to pollution, and our initiatives aim to mitigate these challenges and promote sustainable practices. The  , encompassing Indonesia and the Philippines, is another crucial area where we focus our conservation efforts. Known for its incredible biodiversity, this region’s reefs are essential for marine life and local communities. Our work here helps protect these vibrant ecosystems and supports the livelihoods of those who depend on them. Beyond our field sites, we extend our influence on a regional and global scale. We collaborate with key decision-makers, scientists, and policymakers to amplify our impact. This broader approach allows us to support coral reef conservation efforts worldwide, using our scientific expertise and strategic partnerships to drive meaningful change. At CORAL, our mission is to save coral reefs by focusing on climate adaptation needs, collaborating with local leaders, and supporting under-resourced communities. By strategically choosing where to work, we ensure that our efforts have a lasting and meaningful impact on coral reef conservation. Protecting these vital ecosystems is not just an environmental necessity but a legacy we owe to future generations. Stay tuned for more insights and updates on our conservation efforts, and join us in making a difference."

When she isn’t exploring in her overland Jeep, Kristy Ives is working tirelessly to protect the beautiful planet she loves to explore. With over 25 years of experience in non-profit finance management, Kristy brings a unique blend of expertise and passion to CORAL.  Kristy’s love for the ocean began early. Growing up in Miami, Florida, just a stone’s throw from the Florida Keys, she spent her childhood exploring the underwater world. “I grew up boating, snorkeling, and diving in Biscayne National Park,” she recalls. This early connection to the sea sparked a lifelong passion for marine conservation. Her journey took her to the University of West Florida in Pensacola, where she majored in environmental resources. “I chose this university because it had a 1,000-acre wildlife preserve, much of which was beachfront—ideal for my studies.” Now, she lives on a serene lake just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, but her heart remains tethered to the ocean. Kristy’s journey into non-profit finance was an unexpected yet fortunate turn of events. After graduating, she landed a job at the National Audubon Society. “The Director needed someone to help with the budget, and I volunteered. It quickly became apparent that I had a natural talent for finances and budgeting,” she explains. This newfound talent led her to earn a degree in finance, blending her passion for the environment with her financial skills. Her innovative approach at Audubon, where she transformed the budget model and improved fundraising strategies, set the stage for her role at CORAL.  When she’s not working, Kristy and her partner, Sam, spend three months a year overlanding in their Jeep, exploring remote and stunning landscapes. “We take our Jeep, which pulls a small off-road trailer, out into the wilderness. We’re talking public lands where there aren’t people for miles. We actually work on the road, using Starlink for internet,” she says. Kristy is also a passionate diver. One of her favorite dive experiences was when she swam through a massive school of moon jellies and came face-to-face with a manta ray. “It was enormous and absolutely amazing. Manta rays are not common in South Florida, so it was quite a rarity.” Kristy’s extensive background and innovative mindset make her an invaluable asset to CORAL. She’s eager to apply her knowledge and experience to propel our mission forward. “I love finding solutions and fixing broken systems. It excites me to work on a great idea, a plan, and figure out how to make it happen,” she says enthusiastically. We’re beyond excited to have Kristy on our team and can’t wait to see the incredible impact she’ll make. Stay tuned for more adventures and insights from Kristy as she dives into her new role at CORAL! Welcome to the team, Kristy! 🪸"

My name is Makayla Rickard, and as the Maui Nui Program Manager at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), both my work and my life are deeply intertwined with this community and its vibrant ecosystems. The fires that tore through Lahaina not only ravaged homes and landscapes but also shattered the fabric of our community. For me, this event was more than a professional challenge—it was a deeply personal one. My family and I lost our home, and in the aftermath, we found ourselves displaced, moving multiple times and facing significant hurdles. Finding stable housing has been a continuous struggle, especially with the added challenge of having a beloved pet.  In the year since the fires, our island has been on a journey of recovery—one that is as complex as it is hopeful. The fires left a deep scar on Maui, with over 1,399 homes destroyed and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble.   Iconic places like Banyan Tree Park and the Lahaina public library are back open to residents, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the recovery efforts. The beloved Banyan tree, which was heavily damaged, has shown remarkable signs of regrowth, a symbol of our resilience.   Affordable housing is still a critical issue, and many in our community remain displaced, grappling with the ongoing emotional toll of the tragedy. In response to the fires, CORAL launched the   to provide unrestricted support to local environmental organizations and initiatives. The aim was to empower those who know Maui best—our local leaders, community members, and grassroots organizations—to address the most urgent environmental needs during this time of crisis. Over the past year, this fund has supported a wide range of environmental recovery efforts. One of the organizations supported by the fund is  , which has potted 3,500 trees in 14 grow hubs across Maui and is partnering with master carver Dale Zarella on a series of carvings called “Rising from the Ashes; Spirits of Lāhainā.” These creations, crafted from burned trees, symbolize the resilience and regeneration of our land. Another organization supported by the fund is the  , a grassroots coalition formed to address the environmental damage caused by the fires in Maui. Their mission is to heal the burn scars on the island using bioremediation—natural mitigation methods involving native plants, fungi, and locally-made compost. Their work focuses on making the soil safer for future planting, improving water quality, and protecting the ocean from toxic runoff. The outpouring of support from across the globe has been overwhelming, and I’m deeply moved by the generosity of those who have contributed. When the wildfire swept through Lahaina last August, it left behind a trail of toxic ash, laced with contaminants like arsenic, lead, and copper. These pollutants now pose a serious threat to nearshore health, which are vital to both our community’s economic stability and our cultural identity. Our regional program director, Manuel Mejia, often reminds us of the Hawaiian proverb, “E ola ke kai, E ola kākou,” meaning “As the sea thrives, so do we.” This connection between our well-being and the health of our reefs is deeply rooted in our lives here. In the immediate aftermath, barriers were installed around storm drains to filter out debris, but much of the ash still makes its way into the ocean.   are working tirelessly to monitor the situation. Citizen scientists are using drones to film runoff, and researchers are collecting soil and water samples to understand the extent of the contamination. For example, Dr. Andrea Kealoha from the University of Hawaii has been deploying water sensors that capture data on everything from oxygen levels to water movement, providing a clearer picture of how our reefs are responding.  In the short term, fewer human stressors like tourism might offer some temporary relief, but the long-term effects remain uncertain. There’s also concern about potential toxins building up in fish, threatening food security for many who rely on the reef for their sustenance. As we continue to navigate these challenges, we’re committed to protecting and restoring our precious marine ecosystems, ensuring that they can thrive once again. There’s still so much to be done, but the resilience and determination of the Maui community give me hope. Every day, I’m inspired by the people around me—the neighbors who’ve turned their homes into makeshift shelters, the volunteers who’ve shown up day after day, and the donors who’ve contributed to our recovery efforts. This past year has been the most challenging of my life, but it has also been a testament to the power of community. To everyone who has supported us—whether through donations, volunteer work, or simply keeping us in your thoughts—mahalo. Your support means the world to us as we continue the long road to rebuilding and restoring our island home."

        "content": "Coral reefs are under constant threat from human impacts, and sometimes destruction comes from the people who spend the most time underwater enjoying these beautiful ecosystems up close. For many years, the CORAL team has worked to more deeply understand the tourism impacts from scuba diving and snorkeling so we can use our learnings to inform people across the globe about best practices. Our latest study, published in  , focused on scuba diving in Roatan, Honduras. We looked at the number of divers that different sites can sustainably handle (known as carrying capacity) and how diver behavior affects the reefs. We paid special attention to certification levels and the use of lionfish spears, which are used to control invasive species. After monitoring 180 divers across several sites, we found big differences in how many divers each site could handle—some sites could support 13,000 more divers per year than others.  So, what does this mean for reef conservation? Dr. Antonella Rivera, one of our researchers, explains: “This study shows how important it is to understand how many divers each reef can handle to avoid damaging it. Many factors affect this, including the skill level of divers and how they use spearfishing tools. To protect reefs, we need to regularly assess and adjust these numbers and use this information to guide our decisions.”   The study highlighted substantial variation in the number of divers that different sites could sustainably support. This finding tells a story of the importance of site-specific management strategies to prevent overuse and degradation.   Divers’ behaviors, especially those related to their certification levels, significantly affect the physical integrity of the reefs. Less experienced divers tend to cause more damage, often unintentionally, due to poor buoyancy control and lack of awareness.   While lionfish, an invasive species, pose a serious threat to Caribbean reefs, the study suggests that the method of spearfishing, if not properly managed, can inadvertently harm the coral reefs. This calls for a reassessment of current spearfishing practices and the implementation of more controlled and informed methods. The findings from Roatan indicate a clear need for educational programs, especially for newer divers. Workshops and courses focusing on the ecological impacts of diving can significantly mitigate damage to coral reefs. Educating divers about proper  , the importance of  , and the   can lead to more sustainable diving practices. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of  . The way CORAL incorporates this into our work is by ensuring   use these results and replicate these types of assessments to inform their local management strategies. By regularly monitoring and adjusting the number of divers allowed at specific sites, based on the health and resilience of the reefs, long-term sustainability can be achieved. The study conducted in Roatan offers valuable insights into the complex relationship between tourism and coral reef health. It’s also a clear example of CORAL’s strategies.  We focus on actionable science – deepening the collective understanding of the many aspects of coral reef conservation. By understanding the carrying capacities of different sites and the impacts of diver behavior, we can develop more effective management practices.  Roatan’s reefs, like many around the world, require our attention and care to thrive amidst growing tourism pressures. Through informed and adaptive management, we can ensure that the beauty and biodiversity of these underwater worlds remain intact."

        "content": "For over 30 years, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) has been at the forefront of coral reef conservation. What began as a small group of SCUBA divers passionate about protecting these ecosystems has grown into a global alliance, dedicated to saving coral reefs through innovative partnerships, global conservation science, and community-driven action. Our mission centers around the holistic approach that assesses, protects, and restores coral reefs, allowing them to adapt to the threats of climate change. Guided by NOAA’s definition of coral reef restoration as the “process of assisting the recovery of coral reefs that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed,” our   efforts focus on nurturing ecosystems back to health and resilience by reducing threats. This means our team works threats to coral ecosystems by improving water quality and promoting sustainable fishing practices, while also supporting community-led, climate-smart conservation efforts, resulting in long-lasting stewardship of coral reef ecosystems Coral reefs are critical to marine biodiversity, support coastal communities, and act as natural barriers against storm surges. However, they are under severe threat from pollution, unsustainable fishing, and climate change, with predictions that almost all coral reefs could be lost by 2050 if current trends continue. CORAL recognizes that while climate change is a profound challenge, coral reefs can still adapt—if we reduce local pressures. Through threat reduction in the form of clean water and sustainable fisheries initiatives, we are actively working to restore coral resilience, biodiversity, and community support for long-term reef health. Healthy coral reefs require clean water, but pollution from land-based sources, such as untreated or improperly treated wastewater and sediment runoff, often disrupts this balance. Polluted water causes stress, disease, and degradation in marine ecosystems, making it harder for corals to survive. CORAL’s Clean Water for Reefs initiative tackles this issue head-on by working with local communities to assess water quality, advocate for laws supporting wastewater and watershed management, and operationalize pollution-control infrastructure. Our efforts in clean water management include: CORAL collaborates with community partners to build and manage wastewater treatment plants in critical areas, ensuring that sewage is kept out of the ocean.  For example, in West End, Roatan, CORAL’s support of a local wastewater treatment plant has prevented 29 million gallons of sewage from reaching the reefs each year. In Coxen Hole, we’re advancing efforts to expand this capacity and expect to prevent an additional 49 million gallons of wastewater pollution by the end of 2025. The restoration work happening here is essential for the recovery of our coasts and the survival of marine life. We are enhancing the reef’s ability to withstand climate-related stress. There has been a restoration of the reef because of our wastewater treatment facility as well as a restoration of hope for the community. Sediment runoff from erosion and land development smothers coral reefs, blocking sunlight and hindering coral growth. Through watershed restoration and fishpond rehabilitation projects, particularly in Hawai’i, we’re preventing large amounts of sediment from reaching reefs and preserving these essential marine habitats. In 2025, we’ll begin assessing how this work in Hawai’i can influence other areas in the Pacific Islands with the same threats. Hand-in-hand with our Protect work, CORAL is improving water quality by advocating for strong environmental policies and engaging local communities in stewardship. In Hawai’i, for instance, we introduced legislation to expedite cesspool conversion, a necessary step to reduce sewage pollution and protect both coral reefs and public health. These initiatives are grounded in actionable science, allowing CORAL to measure progress and make evidence-based adjustments to our strategies. Over time, our Clean Water for Reefs efforts have led to measurable reductions in fecal bacteria levels in coastal waters, improvements in water quality, and decreased harmful macro algae that threaten coral habitats. Overfishing is another major threat to coral reefs, as it disrupts the delicate balance of reef ecosystems. CORAL’s sustainable fisheries programs work to restore fish populations and reef biodiversity by collaborating with local communities to establish protected areas and enforce sustainable fishing practices. With community partners, CORAL has established and improved the management of protected areas across marine ecosystems in the Western Caribbean, Fiji, the Coral Triangle (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines),  and Hawai’i. These protected areas serve as safe havens for fish populations, allowing them to grow and contribute to the overall health of the coral reefs. In partnership with coastal communities, CORAL’s fisheries projects aim to enhance fish biomass—by as much as 200% in some regions—thus benefiting both the reef and local livelihoods. Healthier reefs provide a more stable habitat for fish, allowing fishers to harvest higher-quality catches, which helps build a sustainable economy around responsible fishing. Our most recent sustainable fisheries work includes two fishpond restoration projects on the island of  . These ancient Hawaiian fishponds, unique to the Pacific Islands, once supported local communities by maintaining abundant and sustainable fish populations. CORAL has joined forces with community nonprofit Ka Honua Momona in Molokai to restore these ponds, which removes sediment buildup, controls invasive species, and promotes sustainable fishing practices. By reviving these traditional systems, we not only help protect the local reefs from harmful sediment but also honor and support local culture and livelihoods. This work enhances the resilience of reef ecosystems around Molokai and preserves a heritage practice that strengthens both community and ecological health. Our sustainable fisheries work is essential to restoring balance in reef ecosystems, helping them recover from past pressures and adapt to changing conditions. CORAL’s Restore efforts—centered around threat reduction in the form of clean water and sustainable fisheries—are critical to the health and resilience of coral reefs worldwide.  By addressing pollution and overfishing, we’re creating the conditions that allow coral reefs to adapt and survive in a rapidly changing world. Our commitment to science-based action, community engagement, and policy advocacy continues to yield meaningful results, with cleaner waters, healthier fish populations, and stronger reefs that support both biodiversity and coastal communities. Through our partnerships with local stakeholders and our dedication to long-term conservation solutions, CORAL is not only working to save coral reefs but also to foster a global community united by a common goal: to protect and restore one of our planet’s most valuable and life-giving ecosystems. Together, we can ensure that coral reefs—and the communities that depend on them—continue to thrive for generations to come."

        "content": "Nestled within the Gulf of Honduras, the Cayman Crown reef is a unique and critical component of the   system. Recently designated as a protected area, Cayman Crown boasts some of the highest coral cover within the MAR region, featuring live coral cover at an impressive 60% (Giro, 2019). This extraordinary reef serves as a central hub for marine biodiversity, connectivity, and resilience, making it vital for marine life and the surrounding communities that rely on it. The ecological significance of the Cayman Crown goes beyond its coral health. Its distinctive bathymetry supports fish spawning aggregations (FSAs), a process crucial for maintaining healthy fish populations throughout the Gulf of Honduras. With its strategic location, Cayman Crown plays a pivotal role in connecting marine species across various life stages, ensuring the continuity and health of commercially significant fish stocks (Giró, 2019; Pérez Murcia, 2020). The high biomass of fish and other species supported by this reef is essential for the livelihoods of local communities, many of whom depend on these resources for their economic well-being. With generous support from the  , through the MAR Fish Project, CORAL and MAR Fund have partnered to formally understand and mitigate the impact of the closure of the  Cayman Crown Reef as a key Fish Spawning Aggregation site. By legally protecting this reef and the livelihoods that depend on it, we are working to safeguard its biodiversity and the crucial fish stocks it supports, reducing pressures on the ecosystem and fostering sustainable fishing practices in nearby communities. This pilot project has been built upon CORAL’s ongoing efforts to support fishers and coastal communities throughout the Honduran Caribbean. Our team has accumulated a valuable socio-economic database across 33 fishing communities in the region, enabling us to develop tools that promote sustainable fisheries management and livelihood diversification strategies. These insights, combined with CORAL and MAR Fund’s establishment of a socioeconomic baseline for Honduran fishers at Cayman Crown, set a robust foundation for crafting sustainable solutions for both the reef and the communities that rely on it. One of our biggest learnings during the implementation of the project was to know the willingness of fishing communities to learn and change. The communities are understanding the importance of developing projects to diversify their livelihoods that implement sustainable practices to conserve and recover marine ecosystems. They know that the sustainable use of natural resources is a legacy that transcends generations and shapes a future in which both people and the planet can thrive. The Cayman Crown initiative is structured around strengthening local fishers by equipping them with the resources and knowledge needed to diversify their income sources beyond fishing. We recognize that effective conservation requires addressing the economic needs of local communities. To this end, our project prioritizes capacity strengthening and the development of alternative livelihoods that support both marine conservation and economic resilience. Through these focused efforts, we have successfully strengthened fishers’ associations in two key Honduran communities, equipping them with leadership skills, fund management expertise, and sustainable tourism practices. This achievement has laid the foundation for a network of legally recognized fishers’ associations, now poised to drive forward livelihood diversification strategies. By enhancing their resilience, these communities are better prepared to move beyond fishing as their only source of income. CORAL has worked hand-in-hand with local fishers to develop and launch three livelihood diversification projects, complete with technical, logistical, and financial backing. These projects are creating sustainable economic avenues that benefit both the reef ecosystem and local communities. As these initiatives take hold, fishers are transitioning to resilient economic models that promise to lessen their dependence on fishing, helping to safeguard marine biodiversity while supporting local prosperity. With transparency and community connection at our core, we’ve documented each phase of our work, sharing stories, visuals, and infographics that capture the impact of these efforts on local livelihoods and conservation. Our multi-language communication strategy—offered in English, Spanish, and Garifuna—ensures that every community member, as well as global supporters, can appreciate the meaningful outcomes of these projects. Together, through collaboration, capacity strengthening, and innovative livelihood strategies, we are working to ensure that Cayman Crown continues to thrive as a vital marine habitat—and a source of opportunity for generations to come."

Although challenges remain, the recent   shows a slight yet encouraging increase in reef health across the region due to an increase in fish biomass likely resulting from improved enforcement. This marks the first reported improvement in five years, thanks largely to the collaborative conservation efforts among coastal communities and organizations like CORAL.  Our data-driven approach is supporting these communities in building lasting resilience for coral reefs and strengthening our understanding of how to manage these ecosystems effectively in the face of climate change. Using data collected from almost 300 monitoring sites spanning 1,000 kilometers and four countries, the HRI Report Card serves as a crucial health assessment for reefs in the MAR region. Data is collected using the Atlantic Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) reef monitoring methodology and assesses coral health based on four key indicators: live coral cover, fleshy macroalgal cover, herbivorous fish biomass, and commercially important fish biomass. Instead of simply reviewing the data, CORAL uses the findings to inform and adjust our strategies in ways that support and build the capacity of coastal communities. These data help us measure what’s working and what needs further action, allowing us to take targeted steps that enhance reef resilience and community benefits. The 2024 HRI report highlights improvements in herbivorous fish populations, like parrotfish and surgeonfish, in the Bay Islands of Honduras (except Guanaja), where these crucial species thrive in MPAs protected from overfishing. However, herbivore biomass dipped in coastal Honduras, where they are not yet fully safeguarded. CORAL is collaborating with the Fisheries Directorate and local partners to push for a nationwide legal decree to protect herbivorous fish across all of Honduras. By supporting community-led initiatives, sustainable fishing practices, and improved water quality, we aim to create a resilient reef ecosystem for future report cards. This connection between community-driven fisheries management and ecological resilience is at the core of CORAL’s approach. CORAL uses the findings from the HRI Report Card to validate our current strategies and refine and adapt our methods alongside our community partners.  With each report, we can track shifts in reef health, fish populations, and water quality, giving local leaders and fishers a clearer picture of the outcomes of their efforts. This insight allows us to support communities in real time, helping them implement targeted solutions proven to enhance reef health, such as expanded MPA networks and refined water treatment projects under our   initiative. For example, in 2024, Coxen Hole saw a dramatic increase in wastewater treatment investment and will continue to see more in 2025. This is desperately needed after seeing the impacts of untreated/poorly treated wastewater on the area’s beloved reef, Cordelia Banks, which was unable to recover from a devastating bleaching event. The severe mortality of this magnificent reef occurred just after the data collection period ended for this report card. The recent data underscore the impact of collaborative action and reinforce the importance of sustained community engagement and data transparency. As our understanding of these ecosystems grows, we can offer increasingly precise and effective tools to local organizations, amplifying their capacity to maintain resilient reef ecosystems. The HRI Report Card highlights the strength of collaborative conservation and informed action. By pairing community-driven MPA management with conservation science, we are creating a future where reefs and coastal communities can thrive together. The road to reef resilience is challenging, but each bit of data shows us the way forward, with communities and organizations like CORAL united in purpose and action.  With our shared dedication and a commitment to adaptive, community-led strategies, the MAR is on a promising path towards sustained reef health, biodiversity, and resilience. This year’s report encourages us all to continue strengthening these partnerships, knowing that together, we can create a future where coral reefs and the communities that depend on them can thrive side by side."

        "content": "Coral reefs are powerful yet vulnerable ecosystems, rich in biodiversity but increasingly at risk in a changing world. Here at the Coral Reef Alliance, our team advances science to assess the adaptive capacity of corals, protect diverse reef networks, and restore marine ecosystems by influencing management and policy decisions.  Through scientific research, we work to understand how coral reefs can adapt in the face of climate change and translate our findings into data-driven solutions. Coral reefs support coastal communities, act as natural barriers against storm surges, and are critical to marine biodiversity. However, they are severely threatened by pollution, unsustainable fishing, and climate change, with predictions that almost all coral reefs could be lost by 2050 if current trends continue.  CORAL recognizes that climate change is a profound challenge for reefs and that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be key to their survival.  However, though climate change is a global problem, strategic local protection is still critical to maximizing the probability of coral reef survival and recovery.    Over almost a decade of scientific research, CORAL and its partners have shown that protecting connected networks of genetically diverse reefs is critical to ensuring their survival and recovery.   Organisms with genes that are best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, sending their unique genetic code on to the next generation. This process is known as natural selection. Over multiple generations of natural selection, species can evolve, displaying new traits and characteristics. And the more genetically diverse a population of organisms is, the more likely some of those individuals will be able to adapt to whatever circumstances arise. It’s this idea that is essential to coral reefs surviving the heat stress created by climate change.  Through simulating coral reef survival under different climate scenarios, we’ve shown that genetically diverse coral reef networks are much more likely to survive warming waters than their less diverse counterparts. Our research has also found that genetic connections between coral reefs (e.g. via currents that carry coral larvae) are crucial to their prospects because genetic exchange, especially from reefs that are already adapted to high temperatures, can enhance the odds of resilience. First, we must reduce carbon emissions and slow the rate of climate change to give corals a fighting chance. Second, we must protect a diversity of reefs that are themselves genetically diverse. Doing so increases the odds that heat-adapted individuals will be present and naturally selected. Third, we can’t just protect individual patches of reef; we must ensure that reefs are protected in connected networks to allow the exchange of genes. And finally, we must pay particular attention to the presence of hot reefs in these networks, which should allow heat-adapted larvae to spread to other reefs. Despite the importance of genetic variation in coral reef resilience, approaches to reef management often fail to account for evolutionary criteria. This is because assessing coral reef genetic diversity is costly and requires expertise that many practitioners do not have available.  CORAL is working closely with partners to evaluate whether we can estimate coral reef genetic diversity and adaptive capacity from remotely sensed data. As we develop adequate proxies, we can then scale these up, creating a globally applicable tool, which we’re aiming to launch in 2025. Making this information easily and freely accessible worldwide would catalyze its incorporation into coral reef management and marine spatial planning processes as part of countries’ 30×30 commitments. Our Global Conservation Science team’s goal is to influence and leverage partners, fieldwork, and technology to drive adaptation-focused conservation solutions that will rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change.  This biodiversity hotspot is home to 76% of the world’s coral species and supports the livelihoods of millions through fishing, tourism, and coastal protection services. As part of the Climate REEFS initiative (Integrating Risks, Evolution, and socio-Economics for Fisheries Sustainability)—a multi-million dollar collaboration of partners in the USA, UK, Indonesia, and the Philippines—CORAL is working to develop techniques to identify adaptive reefs using remote sensing technologies. The ultimate goal of this effort is to develop a freely available, online tool that can identify genetically diverse reefs across the globe. In-country Climate REEFS partners hope to work with relevant government bodies in Indonesia and the Philippines to co-create revised provincial and national-level marine management plans that reflect our findings. CORAL also developed an international consortium of conservationists, ecologists, and computer scientists with a shared interest in evaluating whether we can measure coral reef diversity and adaptive capacity from space. Through examining relationships between measures of diversity (e.g. species diversity, genetic diversity, and others) and remotely sensed metrics at a series of pilot sites, this group strives to identify the best proxies for reef measures of adaptive potential—work that complements the research undertaken by Climate REEFS.  Our members’ research encompasses a range of approaches and spans three oceans: the Pacific, including sites in the North (e.g., Hawai’i, Palau, and Republic of the Marshall Islands), South (e.g., Fiji), and Indo-west Pacific (e.g., Indonesia and the Philippines), the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean (Mozambique), and the Atlantic (e.g., Honduras and the Turks and Caicos Islands). Last year, for instance, CORAL contributed to the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Target 3 Partnership Meeting in Cambridge, which aimed to coordinate implementation efforts of the Post-2020 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and build technical capacity. The guidelines developed at this meeting and ones like it will inform conservation approaches for diverse ecosystems everywhere on Earth.  CORAL has also recently been accredited by the UN Environment Programme, co-published seven high-impact scientific papers over the last seven years, and shared its findings at multiple high-profile conferences and events.  Notably, in 2023, CORAL further expanded its reach by securing two CORAL Fellows, one of whom is supporting Pacific Coral Triangle countries, based in Honiara, and one of whom is supporting Southeast Asian countries in the Coral Triangle, based in Manado at the Regional Secretariat of the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security. These locally-based consultants are contributing to a climate risk assessment for Coral Triangle reefs as well as a policy analysis that aims to inform fisheries management by reviewing gendered climate vulnerability and climate risks. By working to create readily available tools and resources that enable practitioners in under-resourced settings to incorporate genetic diversity into their coral reef conservation approaches, we’re working to improve the odds that coral reefs will survive and recover in a rapidly changing world.  Our commitment to understanding how we can help corals adapt continues to yield meaningful results. Over the last few years, we’ve successfully co-authored multiple successfully funded research projects, expanded our work to the Coral Triangle (a hub of coral reef biodiversity), and continued to form and strengthen partnerships that help us magnify our international impact. CORAL is not only working to save coral reefs but also to foster a global community united by a common goal: to protect and restore one of our planet’s most valuable and life-giving ecosystems. Together, we can ensure coral reefs—and the communities that depend on them—continue to thrive for generations to come."

Here’s what she had to say:  I spent a great deal of time as a child outside exploring and finding wonder in the world around me. In high school, I took my first trip to Andros in the Bahamas and I never looked back. As soon as I was able to get SCUBA certified and spend time exploring our underwater world, I realized I had to get involved in helping to protect it. We are all inextricably connected. Our fates are intertwined. I want a healthy thriving planet for my family and for us all, and that is only possible with healthy coral reefs!    My favorite reef experience was probably the first time I went diving in Cozumel, Mexico. It was in the late 90’s and I remember experiencing the incredible diversity of corals and fish that I had never seen before. The drift dives there allow you to just float and watch this amazing world go by as if you are flying. I remember watching a yellowhead jawfish carefully carrying shells and small rocks in its mouth to arrange its burrow. This was also the first time I saw a parrotfish sleeping in its cocoon “sleeping bag” of mucus at night. I remember thinking how busy the coral reef was and how all of the organisms seemed to be working together in harmony, all with a purpose. It made one feel small but also somehow connected. It was the first time I felt like I understood how we are all interconnected.   I could not be more thrilled to join the CORAL team. The staff, board, council members, partners, donors, and volunteers are some of the most passionate and inspiring people I have ever met. Our science is innovative and important to leading us to our conservation.  Our program staff understand how to put communities first and build trust through relationships. I am excited to make a difference, our work is important, urgent, and our team is up for the challenge. Each and every team member is fabulous!   I have continued to learn and grow as a leader over the years. I would describe myself as someone with a high level of self-awareness that works hard to be honest, transparent, vulnerable, and build and maintain connections. I prioritize being present, participating, guiding, mentoring, and coaching our team to be efficient and effective. I enjoy pushing our strategy forward to reach our mission and ensuring that our team has the resources they need to move past any obstacle. Ensuring that everyone can come to work each day as their entire authentic selves as well as set boundaries for a healthy balance for their specific work/life situation is something I also care deeply about as a leader.  I am committed to our mission, it is deeply personal to me. I am also committed to relationships with you as partners and supporters. I come from a huge family, I have 8 siblings and 31 nieces and nephews. Family is everything to me. I look forward to getting to know all of my CORAL “family”.  Conservation is about people and building relationships. We need to work on solutions that are built from listening to the communities that have lived and thrived there for multiple generations. They have a deep connection with their surroundings and understand the problems and solutions better than anyone. Conservation works best when we listen, learn, and work together on solutions that will benefit both people and the natural world as we are all connected. This sounds simple, yet I have seen so many projects fail by not doing this well.   As the staff, board, partners, volunteers, and I continue to move forward, we will be looking for opportunities to take the lessons we have learned and drive action. Our strategy of working at the local, regional, and global scale will remain important. We have learned quite a bit about what works and doesn’t work in coral reef conservation in communities and our science is giving us more information and planning tools. Moving forward, we will need to focus even more on the “alliance” in our name to ensure that what we have learned that works is being utilized in as many places as possible through partnerships and coalitions. "

        "content": "Over 20 tons of sediment has been captured in the mountains above Lahaina, the result of a collaborative restoration project led by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL). West Maui is laden with historic sugarcane and pineapple plantations that are now out-of-use. During heavy rain events, the potentially contaminated soil from these degraded landscapes travels down old dirt roads, enters stream gulches, and ultimately reaches the ocean where it  . CORAL uses native plants—and over 100 supportive volunteers—to   and trap the sediment before it has a chance to runoff into the ocean. “This past year alone, our restoration projects have trapped over 20 tons of sediment that would have ultimately ended up on our coral reefs,” says Jen Vander Veur, CORAL’s Senior Program Manager on Maui. “That’s the equivalent weight of 10 cars. It’s so great seeing all of our hard work pay off.” And that’s just the beginning—as the plants grow and the sediment traps continue to accumulate materials, their efficiency will grow. “Ultimately, as our traps collect sediment, that sediment will fill in openings and slow the stormwater even further, trapping more sediment, and so on and so on,” says Vander Veur. “And the more sediment we can keep off of Maui’s reefs the better.” Most   are hosts to zooxanthellae, tiny algae with which they share  . Corals provide the algae with protected environments, and in exchange, the algae use the sun to photosynthesize and produce oxygen, and help the corals remove waste. When sediment is dumped on a coral, it blocks out the necessary sunlight to support this process and corals ultimately die. West Maui’s coral reefs are important sources of coral larvae that replenish reefs across Maui, Lanai and Molokai. Because of this, the area has been designated a priority conservation site by the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force and the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources. But a 2012 Wahikuli-Honokowai Watershed Management Plan prepared for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program identified erosion from degraded agricultural lands as a major threat to these vital coral reef ecosystems. Funded in part by the Hawai‘i Department of Health, CORAL’s program is part of   who are working to restore these lands and stabilize the slope. “It’s great that there is such strong community and governmental support to protect these reefs,” says Vander Veur. “Even with COVID putting a pause to our in-person volunteer planting days, our volunteers have continued to keep this project moving forward. Over 100 volunteers are growing native plants from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that number continues to grow. Once grown, volunteers drop their plants off at a greenhouse space donated to CORAL by Pacific Biodiesel, where they stay until they are ultimately planted at the restoration sites.

        "content": "A new dataset, made public this month by Hawai’i Wai Ola, gives community members access to high quality, open-source water quality testing data dating back to June of 2020. Volunteers and members of  —a local community hui founded by the   to improve water quality—have taken monthly water quality samples at popular sites around Hawai’i Island, including Kahalu’u Bay, Richardson Beach Park, Carlsmith Beach Park, Puhi Bay Beach, Reeds Bay Beach and Moku Ola Beach. The new dataset includes metrics from these locations on pH, salinity, temperature, turbidity, nutrients and enterococcus levels—commonly used indicators of sewage pollution in nearshore ocean environments.  “The fact that we have this data set is incredibly exciting,” says Erica Perez, senior program manager at the Coral Reef Alliance and founding member of Hawai’i Wai Ola. “These are sites that aren’t tested by the Department of Health (DOH), so this is the first time this information is being made available to people.”  While DOH regularly tracks water quality throughout the state, their resources are limited and as a result, there are critical knowledge gaps in the information they collect.  “DOH can’t take action to address poor water quality if they don’t know when the water quality is poor,” says Perez. “The purpose of our program at Hawai’i Wai Ola is to empower local communities to work alongside DOH and help expand their understanding of ocean water quality and overcome their resource barriers.” For example, this new data shows several beaches have experienced unhealthy enterococcus levels over the last year and a half. Richardson Beach Park measured 1119 CFU per 100 mL in August of 2020—that’s nearly nine times higher than the levels considered healthy by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Hawai’i Department of Health issues an alert for any area experiencing levels of 104 CFU per 100 mL or above for a single sample.  But Perez warns that it’s important not to jump to conclusions when noticing one-off data points like this, and instead to focus on the fact that the community near Richardson Beach Park can now work with DOH to identify if there’s a bigger problem and find a resolution.  “These are one-time sampling events that happen once a month, so they don’t necessarily give the full story,” says Perez. “Enterococcus levels can change rapidly based on tides, currents, weather events, etc. It could rain and cesspools could leach into the groundwater and into the shoreline, and then it could be gone the next day. So these levels aren’t always an indicator of an ongoing problem.”  The hui is working with the community to ensure they know about this new resource and they have shared the dataset with DOH so they can conduct a more thorough analysis. This new knowledge will be included in DOH’s bi-annual ocean beach health report that they use to identify areas of concern and strategize.  The whole program and the fact that this data now exists highlights the power of citizen science networks, says Manuel Mejia, the Hawai’i regional program director for the Coral Reef Alliance. Hawai’i Wai Ola and the Coral Reef Alliance are working to train community volunteers to collect water quality samples following DOH protocols. Volunteers will then bring the samples to a water quality lab in Kona for analysis.  “We can’t manage what we can’t measure,” says Mejia. “But we can give communities the tools they need to start measuring, and to advocate for an improvement in water quality which is so desperately needed across our islands. Allowing local communities to have more ownership over their resources and to have a say over how they’re utilized is invaluable.”  The new dataset can be viewed online at hawaiiwaiola.com/data.   The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is committed to saving the world’s coral reefs. The nonprofit organization works at local, regional and global levels to keep coral reefs healthy so they can adapt to climate change and survive for generations to come.

Launched on the eve of the Our Ocean Conference in Palau,   is a user-friendly, open-access platform poised to revolutionize global coral reef monitoring and management by allowing the world’s coral reef monitoring community to work together, in real time. ReefCloud standardizes data collected from around the world, analyzing coral reef composition with 80-90 percent accuracy, 700 times faster than traditional manual assessment, saving weeks and months of labour and freeing precious reef management resources. It was developed by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in collaboration with Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Fiji, the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), University of South Pacific, Queensland University of Technology, Marine Ecology Consulting, Maldives Marine Research Institute and CO2 Consulting, with in kind support from Accenture, Speaking at the launch at PICRC, Australian Ambassador for the Environment Jamie Isbister said ReefCloud brought a transformative change to the way we monitored our coral reefs and came at a critical time for global reef protection. It also included engagement with indigenous communities, many of whom play a key role in marine monitoring. “Coral reefs are rapidly declining, with climate change being their single greatest threat globally,” Mr Isbister said. “This platform is going to address key challenges by helping coral reef managers assess the condition of their reefs and take appropriate management actions.” AIMS Research Team Lead and ReefCloud Director Dr Manuel Gonzalez Rivero said ReefCloud was the “democratization of knowledge”. “We’re partnering with the   to support a transformation in coral reef monitoring,” he said.  “Last year, GCRMN released a   which involved integrating reef monitoring efforts from 12,000 coral reef sites in 73 countries. With limited human resources it took years to painstakingly reconcile inconsistent data formats and methodologies. ReefCloud can automate that process, providing up-to-date information within hours, which leads to more timely and informed decisions on actions to improve the long-term sustainability of our coral reefs.” ReefCloud is a A$6.6M program, jointly funded by AIMS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). DFAT has provided an additional $200,000 to engage indigenous communities, many of whom play a key role in marine monitoring."

        "content": "A   shows that a popular coral restoration technique is unlikely to protect coral reefs from climate change, and is based on the assumption that local threats to reefs are managed effectively. The research, published in the  , used innovative models to explore the response of coral reefs to restoration projects that propagate corals and outplant them into the wild. Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of outplanting corals genetically adapted to warmer temperatures, sometimes called ‘super corals,’ to reefs experiencing climate change as a way to build resilience to warming. The models found that neither approach was successful at preventing a decline in coral coverage in the next several hundred years due to climate change, and that selectively breeding corals to be more heat tolerant will only lead to benefits if conducted at a very large scale over the course of centuries. Even then, benefits won’t be realized for 200 years. Restoring areas with corals that haven’t been selected to be more heat tolerant was ineffective at helping corals survive climate change except at the largest supplementation levels explored. “The scenarios where coral reefs showed the greatest resilience to climate change were those where natural genetic variance was highest, and outplanting heat-tolerant corals in those areas had little to no effect on outcomes,” says Dr. Lukas DeFilippo, who co-led this research as a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington, and is now a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  “Our previous research shows that corals have the best chance of adapting to the effects of climate change, like warming ocean temperatures, if there is high genetic diversity and if habitat is protected from other local stressors.” says Dr. Lisa McManus, the other co-lead, who conducted this work as a postdoctoral researcher  at Rutgers University and is now faculty at the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology. “Repopulating a coral reef with corals that have similar genetic makeups could reduce an area’s natural genetic diversity, and therefore make it harder for all corals to adapt to climate change.”  Coral reef restoration techniques are widely applied throughout the world as a way to repopulate degraded coral reef areas. Though the practice has some benefits, like engaging and educating communities about reef ecosystems, or replenishing a coral reef population after an area has been hit by a storm or suffered direct physical damage, more scientists are speaking up about the limitations of conservation approaches that focus solely on restoration.  “There’s a time and place for coral restoration, but ultimately, restoration alone likely won’t save coral reefs from warming waters for the foreseeable future,” says Dr. Helen Fox, one of the co-authors on this study and the conservation science director at the Coral Reef Alliance. Fox’s doctoral research focused on coral restoration and she is one of few early researchers to have studied its cost effectiveness and long-term success rate. “For starters, if we don’t also address local threats to reefs, like poor water quality and overfishing, then any corals that are outplanted may also eventually die.” The paper’s authors agree that focusing solely on coral restoration and genetically engineering corals to be more tolerant of high temperatures is risky. Our understanding of the genes that determine heat resistance is limited, and focusing on reproducing just one single trait could undermine a coral’s resilience to other stressors or its natural ability to adapt.  Restoration practices also carry a hefty price tag and require a lot of resources. The median cost of restoring just one hectare (or about 2.5 acres) of coral reef has been estimated at over $350,000, and that’s not factoring in the high mortality rates that often come with such projects and the cost of genetically modifying corals.  “My biggest takeaway from this study is that the scale at which restoration would need to be done is so large that we instead give corals a better chance of surviving climate change with reef management strategies that focus on promoting natural genetic variance,” says Dr. Madhavi Colton, another co-author on the paper and the executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “This means keeping corals healthy by creating and managing marine protected area networks, reducing pollution through better wastewater treatment, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” This study was the result of a collaborative effort between the Coral Reef Alliance, University of Washington, Rutgers University, Stanford University, University of Queensland, University of Hawai’i, and The Nature Conservancy; funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and The Nature Conservancy.

She also previously held the role of executive director for Audubon North Carolina and sat on the National Audubon Society’s Climate Cabinet, acting as a leader for environmental conservation. “The underwater world is what led me to conservation,” says Starck about her decision to join CORAL. In addition to more than 20 years of experience in nonprofit conservation management, Starck brings both a background in marine biology and an incredible enthusiasm for CORAL’s mission to save the world’s coral reefs.“Somewhere in the suspended water and time floating along a reef is where I am most at peace. CORAL’s mission, to save the world’s coral reefs, is one that I can bring my entire personal and professional passion and expertise to support.” Though coral reefs only encompass less than one percent of the earth’s surface, they are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet. They are home to 25 percent of all marine life and support over 500 million people with food, income and coastal protection. They are also one of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet, contributing more than $375 billion in services each year.  But the threats to coral reefs continue to mount, and today nearly 75 percent of all coral reefs are threatened by climate change and localized human activities. Scientists predict that 99 percent of coral reefs will be lost by the end of this century without concerted efforts to protect them.  CORAL works through community partnerships to keep coral reefs healthy throughout Hawaii and the Mesoamerican region, and spearheads global conservation science and collaborations to focus attention on what corals need in order to adapt to future climate conditions.

The recent study, published in the journal  , finds that coral reefs can evolve and adapt to the effects of climate change—but only if we protect a sufficient diversity of coral reefs, particularly when it comes to temperatures.  “Evolution happens when corals that have already adapted to new environmental conditions breed with corals that have not yet adapted,” said Malin Pinsky, associate professor at Rutgers and a coauthor of the study. “As ocean temperatures rise, we need to keep corals in hotter waters healthy and protected so they can reproduce and spread their heat tolerance to other coral reef areas.”  The study advocates for a conservation approach that protects coral reefs at local, regional and global scales, in a way that allows heat tolerance to spread.  The authors of the study said if humanity takes rapid and effective action to keep coral reefs healthy at local scales and addresses climate change, coral reef ecosystems may recover over the next century and thrive in the future.   “The best part about these results are that they underscore the importance of our actions at local scales—we don’t have to just sit back and watch coral reefs suffer as our climate changes,” said Madhavi Colton, lead author of the study and former executive director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “This study provides guidance on how to design local conservation solutions that will have real, lasting impacts well into the future.”  Coral reefs cover less than one percent of the earth’s surface, but they are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet.

        "content": "Coral reefs face a difficult and uncertain future. According to a  , the Earth is currently on track to warm by 2.5 degrees Celsius by 2100, enough to wipe out 99% of reefs. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% in the next seven years to avoid this catastrophe. Meanwhile, local threats like pollution and overfishing, also pose serious challenges. Luckily, there are ways we can protect coral reefs AND address the climate crisis simultaneously. Here are three promising solutions:  A remarkable   come from agriculture and land use. In fact, improving our land management strategies could achieve the same effect as decarbonizing all transportation across the globe, removing   as of 2021.  Of all land-use emissions, half result from deforestation. Forests act as effective carbon sinks, capturing CO  from the air and using it to build new plant tissue through photosynthesis. However, when trees are removed or burnt, often to make way for new agricultural lands, the carbon they store is released back into the atmosphere. Traditional agriculture brings other woes as well, including excessive use of fertilizer and increased rates of erosion. During heavy rain events, nutrients and loose sediment can be carried to waterways and oceans where they have serious negative impacts on coral reefs.   kills reefs by covering them and blocking the sunlight they need to photosynthesize. Nutrients, including those often found in fertilizer runoff, promote the growth of algae that may kill and displace corals entirely.  Fortunately, innovative land-use practices offer a greener and more reef-friendly path forward. The widespread use of   alone, for instance, could reduce the expected amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by up to 23.94 gigatons. As we’ve learned from our work on  , restoring and reforesting abandoned farmlands can also be effective in reducing sediment runoff to nearby reefs and reviving native ecosystems. While protecting ocean habitats and reducing emissions might not seem to go hand-in-hand, marine protected areas (MPAs) can actually have remarkable benefits for the climate as well as wildlife and coastal communities. For coral reefs, well-protected MPAs can prevent exposure to damaging fishing practices, facilitate the rebound of key fish species that keep reefs healthy, provide potential income to communities, increase fish catch, and more.  Lesser known are the benefits that marine protected areas can have for the climate, particularly through protecting seagrass and mangrove ecosystems. Seagrass meadows and mangrove forests are amazingly effective when it comes to sequestering carbon. Seagrasses constitute less than 0.1% of the global marine environment but, through trapping dead roots, leaves, and organic matter, bury 10% of ocean sediment-based carbon in their deep soils. Mangroves contribute disproportionately as well, occupying just 2% of marine environments but sequestering 14% of ocean carbon.  Seagrasses and native mangroves are also critical to coral reef health. Both are found in conjunction with reefs, providing critical nursery habitats for juvenile fish and improving water quality through trapping sediment and other pollutants. On the island of Roatán in the Bay Islands of Honduras, our partners at the Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA) are actively replanting mangroves, restoring the crucial ecosystem services these forests provide.   Arguably the most infamous form of marine pollution, plastics constitute   for coral reefs and marine life.   estimated that 11.1 billion plastic items were entangled across reefs in the Asia-Pacific region alone. That same study also concluded that corals in contact with these plastics experienced an 85% increase in likelihood of disease. Microplastics, microscopic plastic particles produced by the decay of larger pieces of plastic material, can abrade corals, impede their ability to feed, and make infection more likely. Plastics also pose serious issues for the many animals that call coral reefs home. They are also terrible for the climate. Many plastics are made from fossil fuels and petrochemicals. From the extraction and transport of the materials necessary for plastic production, to manufacturing, to incineration, the plastic creation process is fossil-fuel intensive across all stages of production. There is even some preliminary evidence to suggest that plastics in the environment   (both greenhouse gasses) into the atmosphere as they decompose. A transition away from these materials would both dramatically curtail emissions over time and begin to address the severe issues posed to coral reefs by marine debris. To this end, CORAL is   tourists and the tourism industry on the dangers of plastic pollution and other coral reef threats.  From urban planning, to carpooling, to forest protection, there are a wide range of creative solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

        "content": "Coral reefs are important because they can prevent many things from happening and they can do many things. One thing is that they give animals a home. One of every four marine animals lives in coral reefs. Clownfish, giant clams, turtles, and many different kinds of fish call coral reefs home. Corals help the animals hide from predators and get food. A fun fact about clownfish in coral is that clownfish are really colorful so that they can blend in with the coral. In addition to helping the animals, corals help protect islands from big waves that are coming to destroy, attack, and erode the island.  But coral reefs are bleaching because of human activity, warming oceans, and greenhouse gasses. One of the causes is pollution, such as fertilizers, pesticides, human sewage, oil spills, and oil drills. Greenhouse gasses, like carbon dioxide, are another cause. When carbon dioxide mixes with saltwater it creates acid. Acid helps the corals bleach, which is not helpful. Greenhouse gasses also cause global warming. Global warming causes glaciers and icebergs to melt into the ocean and then the ocean rises. Corals can’t grow because they don’t get enough sunlight. Coral reefs are also bleaching because of global warming and the ocean is getting too hot. Rising temperatures of the water slow down the growing of the coral. Another way the coral is bleaching is because the algae leaves the coral when the water gets too hot and this can kill the coral.  We need to start protecting our coral reefs because it’s now or never. If the coral bleaches, then the reef goes. If the reef goes, then the animals go. If the animals go, then the ocean goes. If the ocean goes, then the planet isn’t a planet. It creates this whole chain.  If you do these things, we can help save the coral reefs. If you are like me, a person who is very sad about coral reefs bleaching, don’t be sad. We can always fix it. We can always make speeches and signs and go protest. We can also   that do research on coral reefs like the Coral Reef Alliance. If we do all of this, then our planet isn’t destroyed and we can save our Planet Earth, our home where we live. "

        "content": "Each year,   It’s a great cause and an important step—but this year, let’s take it even further and consider moving away from single-use plastic altogether. When plastic makes its way to the ocean, it also finds a home in coral reefs, causing serious problems for these elaborate structures of the sea. The world’s coral reefs are home to some of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, supporting over 4,000 types of fish, and over a million aquatic species depend on reefs at some point in their lives. The good news is   Remember, everything leads to the ocean, so being mindful of how often you purchase, use, and discard plastic is key. What we consume on land, no matter how well it’s discarded can easily find its way to waterways where it can harm fish, birds, coral reefs and so much more.   You can use your voice to advocate for change, make a personal decision to decrease plastic usage, and educate others on the amount of waste that harms our coral reefs and the planet at large. How gut-wrenching are these photos?   Plastic entangles wildlife, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers over seven million square miles and is clouded with micro-plastics, and beaches are constantly littered with trash no matter how many cleanups are carried out. But what we see here is barely scratching the surface of the damage being done to our oceans. Plastic makes up about  , and millions of tons of it wind up in our oceans each year.  gave us a better understanding of the impact of all that plastic on reefs in particular. Researchers studied 159 coral reefs in Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Myanmar, and discovered that   Floating bits of plastic block out sunlight, spread pathogens, and cut into corals, making them more susceptible to infection.  This is likely thanks to more vigorous waste management systems compared to other surveyed regions as well as the reefs being much further off shore.  From warming temperatures and rising sea levels to extreme weather and ocean acidification, every resident of the ocean is adapting to these changes to their environment or perishing in its wake.  The scary part? These effects will worsen year over year without some serious climate action, and coral reefs are among the most vulnerable. This is especially concerning as a quarter of all marine life depends on their survival. In 2016, over half of all coral reefs faced extreme heat stress, and   was killed. From 2014 to 2017, 75% of the world’s coral reefs faced bleaching-level heat. Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed, most often when ocean water gets too warm. Corals will “eject” the symbiotic algae (called zooxanthellae) that live inside them. When corals lose their algae, they not only lose their color (turning white) but also their built-in food source. Research shows that   if they are healthy. That requires us   (i.e. keeping waste out of the ocean) and it requires us to slow the rate of our emissions. As we use and purchase more plastic, we continue to contribute to this cycle of fossil fuels and climate change. Consider a single-use plastic water bottle: when something like a plastic bottle is used once and then tossed, not only does it clog our oceans and become a threat to sea life, but its short lifespan also means producers are pumping more carbon into the atmosphere to meet those single-use needs.   You can start by incorporating small changes into your life. After all, each step toward more sustainable habits is a step toward a healthier planet. But that’s not the whole story. To take it a step further, we all need to advocate for change at a higher level. Let’s first talk about  .  ! Shop at grocery stores with bulk bins, and bring your own reusable bags and containers to fill. Avoid purchasing items that are wrapped in unnecessary plastic packaging. Bring your own to-go containers to restaurants. Try to repair something that’s broken rather than replacing it. Beyond the grocery aisle,  . Push for policies that limit waste, ban single-use plastics, and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Use your voice as a voter to sign petitions. Let your government representatives know you care by writing letters and making phone calls.   to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and reduce the impact of their production and packaging. And finally,  . Help change the culture of consumerism by using your voice and sharing your story on social media and in social circles. Use hashtags like #breakfreefromplastic and share stories about why you’re working so hard to protect our planet. The more we talk about environmental issues, the more we normalize them. And these ideas are certainly worth normalizing."

This is what artist   sees as she masterfully paints a euphoric underwater world of untouched corals in her latest series “ ,” on display at   in Hudson, NY.  We have proudly partnered with Caldwell Gallery Hudson, as they support Kovalenko’s creative message about coral reef conservation by graciously donating 20 percent of exhibition sales to CORAL.  Kovalenko is a born artist—inspired at a young age by her parents who are also artists in Moscow, Russia. Instead of toys, she played with pastel chalk and cut-out characters her mother drew. At the age of ten, she began her professional art education and later went on to study and work internationally.  After spending time abroad, she was inspired to move away from traditional painting. She now calls herself an environmental artist, covering anything from logged trees in the Amazon Rainforest to the burning of ivory tusks in Africa. In 2019, she went backpacking through South America, where she obtained her diving certification and began exploring the underwater world. Out of all the ocean creatures, she was most drawn to corals—saying “they are the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”  In “Utopian Reefscapes,” Kovalenko paints idealized coral reefs, while utilizing both her imagination and different elements of her underwater photographs. Her mission is to create scenery of abundant, untouched reefs in order to inspire viewers to take better care of the ocean. “Coral reefs are being destroyed because of global warming and other  ,” said Kovalenko. “I want to show all the beauty worth saving.”  Kovalenko also played a role in inspiring gallery owner Jay Caldwell to create something special at Caldwell Gallery Hudson. After forming a friendship several years back, the two exchanged ideas about a novel approach to art-driven philanthropy. Now twice a year, Caldwell Gallery Hudson sponsors exhibitions that empower artists whose work pertains to social or environmental issues. For these exhibitions, Caldwell shifts from the industry standard 50/50 artist-gallery split and offers the artist 60 percent of the commission. He then donates half of the gallery’s 40 percent to a nonprofit organization in the artist’s chosen field. Additionally, Caldwell Gallery Hudson hosts the artist’s residency, resulting in a new piece of art that is raffled off. One hundred percent of the money earned from the raffle tickets also goes to the nonprofit. “It’s an opportunity to dig in a little deeper and help in a direct, tangible way,” says Caldwell. Throughout Kovalenko’s exhibition, Caldwell expanded his knowledge and interest in coral reef conservation and has enjoyed passing this inspiration on to gallery visitors.  Like Caldwell and Kovalenko, we are excited to express our shared passion for protecting coral reefs with the art community. Historically, art has been a very powerful tool and can impact how people see or understand a situation. “Visual messages can really bring it home for many people,” says Kovalenko.  Through this new partnership, we aim to make reefs as healthy as they appear in Kovalenko’s paintings. After all, coral reefs provide a home to more than a million species and contribute food and income to coastal communities. They are an ecosystem worth fighting for—because as Kovalenko says, “Coral reefs are the lungs of our planet.”"

It started back in 2010, when founders and college friends Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman met two Costa Rican artisans who were struggling to make ends meet. To help, they purchased and resold 400 handcrafted bracelets, later turning the sale into a mission-driven business. The company now supports local artisans around the world, while also making conscious efforts to protect the environment.   They were particularly drawn to CORAL’s mission to save coral reefs—an ecosystem that supports more than a million marine species and countless coastal communities with food and income. Pura Vida recognizes the vital importance of protecting the ocean and emulates the essence of beach culture in their products. “[Our customers] care deeply and passionately about protecting the things that they love,” says Vanessa Skaggs, Marketing Manager for Pura Vida. And by working with CORAL, Pura Vida’s community is able to see the direct impact their purchases have on coral reefs, coastal communities, and marine life. To support our mission, Pura Vida created a special   pack, with five percent of sales going directly to CORAL. They worked with Andrea Hannemann, who is better known to her 1.3 million followers as  , to design the pack. Living in Hawai‘i, Hannemann is part of a community that relies deeply on coral reefs and the benefits they provide.  We are thrilled to team up with strong voices, like Pura Vida and Hannemann, to spread the message of why it’s so important to protect coral reefs.  Pura Vida demonstrates corporate responsibility by donating CORAL, offsetting carbon emissions, utilizing biodegradable packaging, and supporting local communities with sustainable jobs. Like us, the company hopes to inspire others to prioritize environmental protection, especially when it comes to an ecosystem as valuable as coral reefs. “My hope is that more people will become conscious consumers and realize the impact—that they might not recognize they’re having—on the oceans directly,” says Skaggs. "

His experiences are vast, ranging from diving with bull sharks to living on a tropical island in Southeast Asia. Through GILI Sports, he has been able to share his love of the water and use the business as a platform to advocate for a healthy ocean. “As a diver, I hate seeing bleached reefs,” says Regan. “[Coral reefs] are ecosystems for the millions of fish we have in the world.” According to Regan,   and direct impact on key reef ecosystems is what inspired him to give to our coral reef programs.  “I feel like we’re doing something good and also providing a really great product for people to use.” In fact, many of GILI’s customers strongly resonate with the company’s charitable mission and the fact that they can have a direct impact when purchasing a paddle board. To support coral reef conservation, GILI Sports designed a special   paddle board and donates a portion of its sales to CORAL. And as an added bonus, Regan is maximizing the company’s impact this year by contributing to CORAL’s Earth Day campaign.  GILI has generously agreed to match up to $15,000 of donations made between now and Earth Day, on April 22, 2022. This incredible contribution will go toward projects that manage wastewater pollution, support healthy fisheries, invest in cutting-edge science, and other initiatives that contribute to coral reef health.  There are many ways adventure sports companies, like GILI Sports, can support the environment in meaningful ways. Regan suggests anything from organizing beach clean-ups to using recycled materials to simply finding initiatives that resonate with your customer-base.  “I always look at what’s sustainable,” says Regan. By creating a charitable component at GILI, it allows for a bigger overall impact that can continue for years to come.  We applaud GILI Sports and its founder, who are doing what they can to repopulate important marine species, revive our valuable coral reef ecosystems, and ultimately keep our oceans—and planet—healthy. "

You are surrounded by nature in its purest form and accompanied by generations of community members who’ve come to be immersed in the local culture and tradition.  This special place is what the   organization sees when they envision a future for the Olowalu Valley, an important ecological and cultural site found in West Maui, Hawai‘i. We are proud to partner with Kipuka Olowalu and support their vision to revitalize the valley, preserve its native culture, and save the nearby coral reefs.  The Olowalu Cultural Reserve was reorganized as Kipuka Olowalu in 2020 with a broad mission to cultivate environmental and cultural connectivity and perpetuate traditional Hawaiian values. The group focuses on preserving a 75 acre reserve by minimizing invasive species and restoring the land with native plants.  Even though the work is done on land, it expands as far as the ocean. According to Karin Osuga, Kipuka Olowalu’s executive director, the stream that runs through the reserve flows from the base of the mountains to the mouth of the Pacific Ocean. Its water empties directly onto Olowalu’s coral reefs, which act as an important source of larvae for other reefs throughout Maui Nui.  “In Hawai‘i, there is an understanding that whatever we do on land will impact what is going on in the ocean,” says Osuga. “We want to be responsible in both our land and ocean stewardship so everything is in balance.” Our partnership with Kipuka Olowalu started about a year ago, and ever since we have been working together to expand the organization’s capacity and implement a mauka to makai (ridge-to-reef) approach to save coral reefs in Olowalu. Kipuka Olowalu is bringing together community members and organizational representatives from the region to collaborate on their initiatives and develop a formalized action plan to restore the valley. As part of our partnership, CORAL team members will advise the group on actions that will preserve the area’s coral reefs.  Since working with Kipuka Olowalu, Osuga has noticed new life come back to the valley. “Native plants popped up, the bees came back, and dragonflies showed up,” she says. “This quiet space that hadn’t been actively cared for in a while was suddenly buzzing with life.” By preserving the environment in its original state, we can also preserve the knowledge and stories about land and ocean that Hawaiian ancestors have passed down for generations. “In the Hawaiian worldview, there are so many reasons why coral reefs matter. It’s food, it’s culture, it’s recreation, it’s medicine—all of these things are important,” says Osuga. “We should take care of coral reefs because it’s the right thing to do.”"

We recently had the opportunity to sit down with him and dive in to this passion a little more.   A: I’ve loved the ocean since my childhood. I grew up in the Philippines, a beautiful archipelago, and the island communities there depend a lot on marine resources and the ocean. Growing up, my family would go to the ocean for peace and relaxation and that has stayed with me throughout my life. As a teenager, I learned to sail in the Chesapeake Bay. And as an adult, I was fortunate enough to sail on Hokule‘a as crew and science specialist for the Polynesian Voyaging Society’s Worldwide Voyage. When I’m in the ocean, I feel calm and really connected with life and all its wonders. I just find the ocean to be a source of life and inspiration, and I count myself very lucky to have built a meaningful career based on conservation and getting to work with communities to protect our oceans.   A: My parents taught me how to care for coral reefs and respect people and nature. They introduced me to the wonders of this world. For all their importance and beauty, however, coral reefs are often unseen and undervalued even though they are immensely important to humanity. A lot of our food, medicines and recreation come from the ocean. Working across the Pacific with many communities, from Fiji to the Philippines and Indonesia, and here in Hawai‘i, I’ve really learned how important coral reefs are to people’s wellbeing—not just for physical sustenance, but for cultural and spiritual wellbeing, too.   A: Across the Pacific, there’s this caring for the ocean like it’s family, and I see that especially strong here in Hawai‘i. Bioculturally, coral reefs are foundational in Hawai‘i. There is an  , or Hawaiian proverb, that says  , which means “though the sea be deep and rough, the coral rock remains standing.” It’s often said of people or communities who remain calm and persevere through difficult times. And to me, this resilience describes the communities in Hawai‘i that continue traditions of adaptive management and caring for reefs so that they can continue to rely on and take care of their families. There is this beautiful reciprocity between people and the ocean and that inspires me to help carry out our mission at CORAL.   A: When I was a young boy, my father used to take me diving with him. I’d stay on the boat and watch his bubbles come to the surface and I’d follow him. And as we got to shallower water, I still remember it very vividly, I’d start to see the rainbow colors and the riot of marine life teeming in wondrous abundance. And that magic, that wonder, has stayed with me, and I’ll never forget it. I hope we can save reefs so that my children, and my grandchildren, get to experience that same wonder that I experienced as a young boy.   A: Coral reefs provide habitat and shelter for all kinds of marine life—per square inch, they are one of the highest biodiversity habitats in the world. And they provide humanity with a lot of medicines and food for over ½ billion people around the world. In Hawai‘i, they protect our coastal areas to the tune of $836 million annually. Without coral reefs, our economy would be a lot more vulnerable. In terms of livelihoods, and fishermen feeding the families, or local businesses and tourism operations that rely on coral reef ecosystems—I’ve seen this dependency on coral reef health play out countless of times across many countries. Coral reefs keep many island economies thriving. It’s really in our best interest to keep them healthy. As the Hawaiian proverb goes,  —as the ocean thrives, so do we."

        "title": "Inside CORAL’s Action-Packed Staff Summit",
        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Recently, the CORAL team gathered in the vibrant coastal paradise of Cozumel, Mexico, for an unforgettable staff summit. This event brought together staff members, board members, and key partners from around the globe to collaborate, learn, and set the course for the future of coral reef conservation. Our primary goals were to foster relationships among team members, promote cross-departmental collaboration, and provide opportunities for personal growth and skill enhancement. We dove into open-space conversations, tackled conflict resolution workshops, and enjoyed fun activities like scuba diving and snorkeling. These moments helped us bond, improve communication, and strengthen our commitment to protecting our oceans. The dive excursions were a highlight for many of us, providing a chance to see the rich coral reefs of Cozumel up close. We enjoyed several morning dives (and snorkels), including a memorable dive with our board members. These underwater adventures were nothing short of magical. We encountered a variety of marine life, from baby sharks and giant sea turtles to elegant rays and a dazzling array of colorful fish. Every dive served as a reminder of the vibrant ecosystems we are dedicated to protecting. It was particularly exciting to watch our dive masters talk through CORAL-produced dive guides, reminding visitors to adhere to sustainable diving practices. We dove in a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which added an extra layer of significance to our experience. Having a patrol boat check our passes was a highlight, as we know the importance of regulatory efforts in preserving these fragile environments. It was affirming to witness firsthand how our collaborative efforts with local authorities and partners are making a tangible difference. Diving in the MPA not only allowed us to observe the stunning biodiversity of Cozumel’s reefs but also gave us a unique perspective on the impact of our conservation efforts in the region. Being in the water together and experiencing the beauty and challenges of the reefs reinforced our dedication to our mission and the importance of our work. El momento más bonito para mi en el summit fue cuando me lancé al agua para hacer snorkel! (The most beautiful moment for me at the summit was when I jumped into the water to snorkel!) Spending time with the team and board members underwater was an incredible experience. It allowed us to see firsthand the vital importance of our work and underscored why protecting reefs is essential. My favorite moment was diving with the whole team! Key moments included spotting a seahorse, double flying gurnards, and a huge turtle! Our summit was packed with engaging workshops and activities designed to boost our personal growth and skills. One of the standout sessions was our conflict resolution workshop. Using translation software, we broke down language barriers and connected with colleagues we hadn’t previously worked with. These sessions mixed insightful talks with hands-on role-playing exercises, giving us practical tools for navigating challenges and creating a more harmonious work environment. We also participated in open-space conversations, where we could choose from various CORAL-related topics and break into small group discussions. This format allowed us to share thoughts, questions, and ideas freely, encouraging creative problem-solving and a deeper understanding of each other’s work. The best part of the week was being able to see each other and interact personally, connect as a team, and identify our strategies and ways of collaborating. I think this strengthens us as a team. I loved connecting with coworkers I don’t usually meet with, gaining a better understanding of CORAL’s reach, and making valuable connections with the Western Caribbean team. My favorite thing was getting to know more about the ‘whole person’ of many of our fabulous staff! My favorite was feeling the good vibes and team bonding…and all the smiles! Throughout the week we had the opportunity to learn about   in the Western Caribbean. Tanya and Javier, our local experts, provided an in-depth overview, shedding light on both the challenges and successes faced by the region. They discussed the current state of Cozumel’s reefs, highlighting the main stressors such as climate change, pollution, overfishing, and tourism pressure. Our ongoing efforts in the area include reef restoration, sustainable tourism, and community engagement programs. Tanya and Javier outlined our goals for FY25, emphasizing our commitment to expanding these initiatives.  Collaboration with   and the cruise industry was another key focus. By creating DMOs, we ensure tourism development aligns with sustainable practices, benefiting both the environment and the local economy. Engaging with the cruise industry allows us to advocate for responsible tourism and reduce its environmental footprint. At the end of the session, CORAL staff had the opportunity to sit down with local partners to better understand their work and explore future collaboration. These discussions provided invaluable insights and strengthened our commitment to working hand-in-hand with local communities to protect and restore coral reefs. Learning from the successes and challenges in Cozumel gives us a deeper understanding of coral reef conservation complexities and inspires us to implement similar strategies globally. My favorite part of the Summit was the opportunity to showcase the work being done here in the Western Caribbean, while connecting with the entire team as colleagues and most importantly as humans with a common goal. It was great to connect with someone who works directly with the Marine Protected Areas around Cozumel. Having an open dialogue and hearing firsthand about the challenges and benefits of this system was incredibly valuable. Spending quality time with my remote coworkers is always a treat. Being physically in the same space as these wonderful humans–who share the same level of passion and dedication to the ocean–has deepened relationships in ways we are not able to through a computer screen. The CORAL Staff Summit in Cozumel was a testament to the power of unity and shared purpose. As we return to our respective regions, we carry with us renewed energy and a deeper commitment to protecting coral reefs. Together, we are poised to make even greater strides in conservation, ensuring that these vital ecosystems continue to thrive for generations to come."

The Olowalu Reef along the west coast of Maui, also known as the “Mother Reef,” contains some of Hawai‘i’s oldest corals and acts as an important source of larvae to Maui Nui. It also provides food and shelter to many marine animals and is significant to Native Hawaiian culture and the local economy.  Currently, we risk losing Olowalu’s coral reefs due to local stressors in the area, like land-based pollution. When it rains, sediment runs off of degraded landscapes, enters the ocean, and pollutes the water. These contaminants then block sunlight, increase the risk of coral disease, and ultimately can smother coral reefs.  We need to act now if we want to save Olowalu’s reefs and contribute to the protection of Hawai‘i’s nearshore waters. And thanks to the support from Hawai‘i Community Foundation, we are one step closer. This year, we will collaborate with  Kīpuka Olowalu to increase their capacity to implement new coastal resilience strategies in the valley above Olowalu’s reefs. Additionally, we plan to increase awareness and urgency around community action and focus on systemic and structural problems that have led to poor land management. "

The focus for the year was achieving measurable outcomes to save coral reefs and to drive conservation programs and science to the next level. Here, we’ll explore some of the key highlights from the report. We worked with local communities and governments to enhance protection of marine protected areas and to promote sustainable fishing practices. Through this work we protected over 8,000 square kilometers of coral reef habitat, which is a major win for the health of these vital ecosystems. To complement this, CORAL supported 19  , giving them resources to manage and protect their coral reefs. In addition, we kept over 29 million gallons of sewage out of coastal waters. In 2022 we grew our climate adaptation partnerships and technology alongside an alliance of scientists to safeguard coral reefs so they can adapt to climate change. We collected over 2 million temperature data points in the Western Caribbean to understand how reef geomorphology links to thermal and genetic diversity. This data will one day be used to improve satellite technologies. These technologies have the potential to identify a reef’s ability to adapt to warming ocean temperatures.

        "content": "At just 31 years old, Trudy Hilton, a local from the island of Roatan, Honduras is determined to make a lasting impact in her community. She recently became Roatan’s new vice mayor and is focusing on improving the long-term sustainability of the island and its natural environments.  We’re proud to call Hilton a local partner, having previously collaborated with her on initiatives to improve ocean conditions in Roatan. Like CORAL, Hilton understands the value of coral reefs and is dedicated to preserving the many benefits these ecosystems bring to her community. Success didn’t come easily to Hilton. Having grown up in a family affected by generational poverty, she faced many day-to-day challenges and setbacks. But she was able to beat the odds and graduate high school—a major accomplishment in her family—and later went on to study political science at an American college. She has since worked at an HIV/AIDS clinic and in community development, among other projects.  Thanks to her neighbor, a founder of the  , she was inspired to give back to her community from a young age. “I think people see the love I have for my people and for this island,” says Hilton, “That is what opened the door for me to be considered for the position of vice mayor.”   Now in office, Hilton is working to put rules and regulations in place that will protect the island’s coral reefs. “I spent almost every day of my childhood in the water,” says Hilton. “So am I connected [to the ocean]? Absolutely.” According to Hilton, coral reefs are important to her and to the island because of the protection they provide from tropical storms and the value they add to the local tourism industry.  For the last couple of years, Hilton has worked with CORAL, along with other local partners, to improve water and sanitation on Roatan. Wastewater pollution creates challenging conditions for coral reefs and makes it harder for them to adapt to our planet’s changing climate, along with many negative impacts on human health.  Leaders at CORAL, such as our Mesoamerican Regional Program Director Tanya Amaya and Conservation Program Director Jenny Myton, have educated Hilton on wastewater pollution and how it impacts coral reefs. Together, they are now working to implement solutions to this problem.  During her time in office, Hilton says,“We are going to give huge priority to water and sanitation, and black waters, because they are damaging our reefs and affecting our health and the environment.”     While wastewater pollution is a major problem throughout the island, Hilton wants to focus on solving the problem in Coxen Hole.  In Coxen Hole, CORAL has been working with local residents to operationalize a wastewater treatment plant. The goal is to replicate the  , in which we significantly decreased coral disease and bacterial levels in nearshore waters.  “I believe if we can get Coxen Hole in order, then we can do it in any other community,” says Hilton. According to Hilton, a large population, various types of homes, and more traditional ways of thinking, all make Coxen Hole one of most challenging neighborhoods in which to tackle wastewater pollution.  But Hilton is ready to put in the work. She plans to educate and work hand-in-hand with different members of the community, in order to prioritize sanitation initiatives and the positive outcomes clean water will have on local residents and the island’s coral reefs.  We look forward to continuing this important partnership with Hilton and other key players in Roatan, in order to keep coral reef ecosystems healthy and thriving in the Mesoamerican reef region. "

        "content": "Looking at Earth from space, our planet’s rivers and streams resemble a vast network of veins, pulsing with life and water. These natural waterways, part of intricate systems called watersheds, weave through landscapes, connecting us in unseen ways to the ocean’s vast expanse.  Whether it’s a closed watershed draining into a secluded lake or open lagoons merging with the ocean,  Imagine the Earth’s surface veined with a network of rivers and streams, much like the circulatory system in our bodies. These watersheds are nature’s way of collecting and delivering rainwater and snowmelt to the ocean.  .  Watersheds are the Earth’s lifelines, ensuring that water, essential for all forms of life, circulates through ecosystems, towns, cities, and eventually, the sea. Take the Amazon Basin, our planet’s largest watershed, which discharges an average of 209,000 cubic meters of water per second into the Atlantic Ocean. Or the Mississippi River Basin, which gathers water from 31 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, illustrating how watersheds can shape the geography, climate, and economy of extensive regions.  These massive water systems play a crucial role in our world, influencing weather patterns, supporting biodiversity, and providing water resources for billions of people. So why does this matter to coral reefs? Well, as pristine as some of these waterways may appear, the harsh truth is they’re often carriers of pollutants from our cities, farms, and factories. Everything from plastic bottles to agricultural runoff finds its way into these waters, embarking on a destructive journey to the ocean.  The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling vortex of marine debris double the size of Texas, is a stark illustration of how our consumption and waste management practices on land can lead to environmental catastrophes in the ocean.  break down into microplastics, are ingested by marine life, enter into the food chain, and cause untold harm to ocean ecosystems.  leads to deadly algal blooms, creating vast dead zones where life, including coral reefs, cannot thrive. These examples underscore the interconnectedness of our actions and the health of marine environments.  This “water footprint” encompasses not only the direct use of water in our homes but also the indirect use embedded in the lifecycle of goods and services we consume. For instance, the agricultural runoff from producing the food on our plates can lead to nutrient pollution in nearby rivers, which eventually flows into the ocean, causing harmful algal blooms and dead zones.   By becoming mindful of our water footprint and making eco-friendly choices, we can help ensure cleaner rivers and healthier oceans.  Simple yet effective steps like opting for minimal packaging, supporting sustainable agriculture and choosing more plant-based options, reducing water-intensive goods, and cutting down on plastic use can make a big difference. Additionally, choosing organic lawn care to minimize harmful runoff and getting involved in local clean-up efforts are practical ways to keep pollution out of our waterways.  By advocating for policies and initiatives that focus on water quality and pollution reduction, we collectively contribute to a more sustainable and thriving environment. In the heart of Maui Nui, which includes the Hawaiian islands of Maui, Molokai, and Lanai, CORAL is actively working to combat the issue of watershed pollution affecting our oceans.   By adopting a “ridge to reef” approach, we aim to restore the natural function of an ahupua‘a (watershed) to filter stormwater and absorb nutrients, sediments, and other chemicals, showcasing our commitment to protecting these vital connections. By understanding the intricate connections between our local waterways and the ocean, we can begin to appreciate the profound impact our everyday actions have on the world’s oceans.  . Let’s commit to protecting these vital lifelines, ensuring a healthier planet for future generations. Together, we can safeguard the health of our blue planet, proving that even the smallest actions can lead to meaningful environmental change. The journey from land to sea is far more interconnected than we might realize. Our local waterways, from the smallest streams to the mightiest rivers, serve as vital conduits linking our actions on land to the health and vitality of coral reefs and marine ecosystems. As we navigate through Earth Month and beyond, let’s embrace our shared responsibility to protect these precious lifelines. By understanding and appreciating the profound impact of our everyday choices, we can work together to ensure a healthier planet for generations to come. Together, let’s safeguard the health of our blue planet and continue to make a positive difference, one drop at a time."

        "content": "Why don’t we focus on coral restoration? It’s a question we, at CORAL, have been asked time and time again.  We address overfishing, minimize water pollution, support local communities, and lead cutting-edge research on coral adaptation to climate change…but we don’t generally work on coral restoration projects. Our decision comes down to the fact that coral restoration alone is unlikely to save reefs from our planet’s warming temperatures if we don’t reduce local stressors. According to a   published in   and co-authored by CORAL scientists, popular coral restoration techniques would be unlikely to protect coral reefs from climate change. The research used innovative models to explore the response of coral reefs to restoration projects that propagate corals and outplant them into the wild. Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of outplanting corals that have been genetically adapted to warmer temperatures, sometimes called ‘super corals,’ to reefs experiencing climate change as a way to build resilience to warming. The models found that neither approach was successful at preventing a decline in coral coverage in the next several hundred years due to climate change, and that selectively breeding corals to be more heat tolerant will only lead to benefits if conducted at a very large scale over the course of centuries. Even then, the benefits won’t be realized for 200 years. In the models, restoring areas with corals that haven’t been selected to be more heat tolerant was ineffective at helping corals survive climate change except at the largest supplementation levels explored. Though coral restoration can have some benefits, like educating communities about reef ecosystems or replenishing an area that has been hit by a storm or suffered direct physical damage, more scientists are speaking up about the limitations of conservation approaches that focus solely on restoration.  “Our previous research shows that corals have the best chance of adapting to the effects of climate change, like warming ocean temperatures, if there is high genetic diversity and if habitat is protected from other local stressors.” says Dr. Lisa McManus, the study’s co-author and a CORAL partner. “Repopulating a coral reef with corals that have similar genetic makeups could reduce an area’s natural genetic diversity, and therefore make it harder for all corals to adapt to climate change.”  Restoration alone is unlikely to save coral reefs from warming waters—and moreover, the techniques are expensive and would need to be performed at an unrealistically large scale in order to be effective. Additionally, coral restoration projects can only be successful if local threats to reefs are managed effectively: otherwise, you’re utilizing resources to outplant corals into an area where they will soon be threatened by poor water quality or overfishing.  By doing that, we can create the conditions that corals need to be able to adapt to climate change on their own, so long as emissions are also reduced. That’s why we invest in projects that will keep coral reefs healthy and protect a wide-range of diverse coral reef networks.   For example, in Hawai’i and  in the Western Caribbean region, we  , protect marine habitats, invest in wastewater treatment infrastructure, mobilize communities to save their coral reefs—and more. And on a global scale, we advance innovative technologies, like the  , to help stakeholders better understand how to factor natural evolutionary processes into their conservation efforts.  By reducing major threats, like overfishing and water pollution, we are keeping coral reefs healthy at the local level. We are also advocating for climate action and building worldwide partnerships and spreading awareness of how to create the necessary conditions for corals to adapt to climate change. We know we have a long road ahead. But by focusing on the most effective conservation strategies, we have a fighting chance to save coral reefs—some of the ocean’s most valuable marine ecosystems. "

        "content": "As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, the health of our oceans remains a critical concern. Oceans cover more than 70% of our planet’s surface and are integral to life on Earth. However, the future of these vast, life-sustaining waters are increasingly threatened.  Here’s why clean water is vital for the future of our oceans. Clean water is the cornerstone of healthy marine ecosystems.  From the tiniest plankton to the largest whales, these ecosystems rely on the purity of water to sustain life.  Coral reefs are incredibly sensitive to changes in water quality. Polluted water can lead to disease, coral bleaching, and death, impacting not only the corals but also the myriad of species that depend on them for shelter and food. Did you know? Approximately   rely on seafood as a primary source of protein.   Toxins such as mercury and microplastics accumulate in marine life and can pose significant health risks to humans who consume contaminated seafood. Moreover, many coastal communities depend on clean oceans for their livelihoods. Fishing, tourism, and recreation industries all require healthy marine environments. The degradation of water quality can lead to economic losses and affect the well-being of these communities. Oceans play a pivotal role in regulating the Earth’s climate.  However, polluted and degraded oceans lose their capacity to perform these essential functions. Pollution can also exacerbate ocean acidification, a process where increased CO2 levels lower the pH of seawater. This has severe consequences for marine life, particularly for organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as mollusks and corals. Maintaining clean water in our oceans is essential to support their role in climate regulation and to protect marine biodiversity. Clean water is crucial for the conservation of marine biodiversity.  Polluted oceans can lead to dead zones—areas with such low oxygen levels that marine life cannot survive. These zones are often caused by nutrient pollution from agricultural runoff, which leads to algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water.  Biodiverse ecosystems are better able to withstand and recover from environmental stressors, making the health of our oceans a matter of global environmental stability. Protecting the future of our oceans requires concerted efforts at multiple levels.  Limiting the use of single-use plastics, properly disposing of waste, and reducing chemical runoff from agriculture and industry are critical steps.  Promoting   and aquaculture practices helps ensure that marine populations remain healthy and that ecosystems are not overexploited.  Addressing climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions will help mitigate the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.  Establishing  , implementing wastewater treatment plants, and supporting conservation initiatives can safeguard critical habitats and species.  Increasing awareness about the importance of clean oceans and encouraging responsible behavior among individuals and communities is essential. It’s crystal clear…clean water is vital for the health and sustainability of our oceans and our planet. It supports marine life, human health, and economic stability, and plays a key role in regulating the Earth’s climate. Protecting our oceans from pollution and degradation is a shared responsibility that requires urgent and sustained action. The future of our planet depends on it."

        "content": "Can you imagine being constantly forced to drink, swim, and bathe in dirty, polluted water? It’s a harsh reality for many humans, yet ironically, our actions subject coral reefs to the same grim conditions. Water quality threats are a major culprit in coral decline. Among the various contaminants, untreated wastewater or sewage emerges as a leading contributor, causing devastating effects on coral health. And well, let’s face it, that’s…crap.  But before we break down the major water quality issues affecting coral reefs today, let’s touch on why this is important. Coral reefs are indispensable ecosystems, punching well above their size. Occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor, they support an astonishing 25% of all marine species. Their economic value is staggering, generating billions annually through tourism, fisheries, and safeguarding coastal areas.  Beyond their economic impact, reefs are vital in global climate regulation, contributing significantly to carbon and nitrogen cycles. Despite their critical role, coral reefs face an expanding number of threats, jeopardizing their survival. Let’s talk about untreated (or poorly treated) wastewater, or as we like to call it, straight-up sewage. Our team has categorized this as one of the biggest threats to reefs around the world.  The issue comes from both cities and rural areas where the sewage systems are, let’s say, less than ideal. When this untreated sewage flows into coastal waters, it brings along a cocktail of nasty stuff like high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients are a buffet for algae, which grows out of control and smothers coral reefs, blocking sunlight and sucking up oxygen.  On top of that, sewage is a breeding ground for bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that can make corals sick. And let’s not forget the household and industrial chemicals mixed in, which are toxic and mess with coral reproduction and growth. In short, untreated sewage is bad news for our reefs. Agricultural activities are another big culprit in water pollution. Think about it – all those pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used on farms don’t just stay put. They run off into rivers and eventually end up in the ocean.  When these chemicals hit the water, they promote harmful algal blooms (HABs), which produce toxins detrimental to coral health. These substances also cause sedimentation, making the water cloudy and blocking sunlight from reaching the corals. And without sunlight, corals can’t photosynthesize and thrive. Industries along coastlines often dump pollutants straight into the ocean. We’re talking about heavy metals, oil, and other harmful chemicals.  Really? Yes, really. These pollutants can have catastrophic effects on coral reefs. They build up in the tissues of marine organisms, causing long-term health issues. Plus, they mess with the reproductive systems of corals, making it harder for them to bounce back from other stresses. Plastic pollution is a catastrophic, growing problem for our oceans, and coral reefs are especially vulnerable. Plastic debris can physically damage coral structures, breaking branches and harming their growth. Even worse, plastic can act as a vehicle for pathogens, introducing diseases and causing widespread coral decline.   have found that coral reefs with plastic debris were 20 times more likely to be diseased than those without. Humans produce about 300 million tons of plastic  , and an estimated 8 million tons of it end up in the oceans. If we don’t tackle this issue, our reefs will continue to decline. Construction activities, deforestation, and coastal development significantly increase sedimentation rates in coastal waters. This excess sediment clouds the water, preventing essential sunlight from reaching coral reefs, which is critical for their photosynthesis and survival.  Additionally, sediment often carries harmful pollutants such as heavy metals and pesticides, further compromising water quality. As sediment accumulates, it can bury corals, suffocating them and impeding their ability to regenerate. Climate change, though not a water quality issue itself, intensifies numerous challenges for coral reefs. Increasing sea temperatures trigger coral bleaching events, where corals expel their vital algae partners, leading to widespread mortality if prolonged.  Moreover, ocean acidification from rising CO2 levels weakens coral skeletons, making them vulnerable to additional stressors. These compounding effects underscore the urgent need for global action to mitigate climate change and protect coral reef ecosystems. Untreated wastewater is the primary culprit, introducing harmful nutrients, pathogens, and chemicals into the ocean.  Tackling untreated wastewater is critical for the longevity of coral reefs. Improving infrastructure by investing in proper sewage treatment facilities can significantly reduce the amount of untreated wastewater entering marine environments and allow coral reefs to recover and thrive. Enforcing stricter regulations on wastewater discharges can minimize pollution, educating communities about the impacts of untreated wastewater on coral reefs can foster better waste management practices, and implementing green infrastructure, such as constructed wetlands, can naturally treat sewage before it reaches the ocean. Coral reefs are in big trouble if we don’t take action now.  Addressing this challenge requires concerted efforts from governments, industries, and communities. By doing this critical work, we can preserve these lifegiving ecosystems for future generations. For more insights on marine conservation and the latest updates on coral reef health, stay tuned. Protecting our oceans is not just an environmental necessity but a legacy we owe to the planet."

To save coral reefs, we must address two major threats: poor water quality from land-based pollution and unsustainable fishing practices. By tackling these issues and implementing climate-smart planning, we can help coral reefs adapt to climate change. Our research shows that this is not only possible but that solutions are available right now. The future of coral reefs is promising. By now you may have seen our BBC mini-documentary featuring a community working alongside CORAL to secure a vibrant future for their reef. This collaboration ensures the reef can continue to sustain the livelihoods that depend on it, showcasing a model for successful conservation efforts. In the Honduran community of West End, we successfully implemented a community-supported wastewater treatment plant, connecting 36 restaurants, 333 homes, and 63 businesses, including 11 dive shops. It may not be the most glamorous work, but it has the biggest impact on these delicate ecosystems! The West End project alone is keeping 30 million gallons of raw sewage annually off what was once a dying reef and a beach unsafe for families to swim. Now, we are focusing on a wastewater project in Coxen Hole. Our goal beyond this is to replicate our successes in three more communities.   to our Clean Water for Reefs Campaign will help tackle wastewater issues in priority coral reef areas with significant tourism impacts, including Cozumel, Mexico; Coxen Hole, Roatan; and Caye Caulker, Belize. These locations have what we call “enabling conditions”, the conditions that set us up for success:  to our Clean Water for Reefs campaign will connect another 800 homes to the wastewater system, resulting in 49 MILLION gallons of sewage being properly treated before entering the ocean. We have communities willing and ready to implement these solutions and now we need everyone to do their part to make it happen!"

Thanks to our Global Conservation Science team, we have given everyone the opportunity to participate in the recovery of coral reefs during bleaching events. As climate change warms our oceans, we know corals can adapt, but only if we let them. Our team in the Western Caribbean was busy in 2023! We all know access to clean water is essential for life, and coral reefs are no different. Securing clean water for reefs is a foundational effort here at CORAL, and our team created the Marine Water Quality Protocol for the Mesoamerican Reef System.  In addition to clean water, coral reefs thrive from their symbiotic relationships with the creatures around them. In the spirit of sustainable fishing practices, our team has also worked diligently on preserving lobsters and conchs, of which both are equally ecologically important for coral reef ecosystems. In 2023 we officially kicked off our partnership with Ka Honua Momona (KHM) in Molokai. KHM staff have lineal ties to this beautiful place and have kuleana (responsibility) in caring for Alii and Kalokoeli fishponds, which are community treasures and sources of education, food, cultural renewal, and connection. As a result of this project’s efforts to improve habitat for fish and wildlife, we anticipate a simultaneous enhancement of community resilience. Unfortunately, coral reefs are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms. This has led to a decline in the health and resilience of many coral reefs, which in turn has negatively impacted the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them for food, income, and cultural identity.

The wildfires in Lahaina, a place many call home, not only ravaged the landscape but also struck at the heart of our ‘ohana—our family, friends, supporters, and the vibrant ecosystems we are committed to protecting. This tragedy served as a stark wake-up call, underscoring the critical nature of our mission to safeguard our oceans and the communities that rely on them. In response, we launched the  , an emergency fund reserved specifically for climate change-related disasters, including coastal flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and mass bleaching events. This initiative wasn’t merely a reaction to a crisis; it emerged from the necessity to bolster the resilience and health of our coastal ecosystems and communities, ensuring their sustainability for generations to come. “The people are most important right now to everyone,”   Heather Starck, Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, in the early days following the disaster. “We have staff, family, friends, and colleagues facing unimaginable loss. Our focus is on supporting them as we all work towards recovery.” This sentiment has continuously fueled our commitment to Maui’s recovery and resilience. The wildfires that swept through Lahaina have underscored the vulnerability of our communities and the ecosystems that sustain them.   The aftermath of the fires saw three such organizations facing unprecedented challenges, with losses that threatened to halt their crucial work. Through the Community Resilience Fund, we’ve been able to offer unrestricted support to: By extending a helping hand to these organizations, we not only aid in their immediate recovery but also reinforce the foundation of our collective mission. Each of these groups embodies the essence of resilience and dedication to the environment and community of West Maui. Their work is integral to the health of both land and sea, which in turn benefits the coral reef ecosystems we are working to protect. As for the reefs, the true extent of the wildfires’ impact remains uncertain. “We do not know the state of the reefs yet, but we’re working with our partners to find out,” says Makayla Rickard, Maui Nui Program Manager. The fires have likely left behind toxic chemicals that could be flushed into the ocean, posing significant risks to the reefs, especially those near Lahaina, like the ancient Olowalu Reef. The main threats to these vital ecosystems are runoff and debris, which could bury the reefs, blocking sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. There’s also the risk of algae blooms, fueled by fertilizers or sewage in the runoff, which can smother corals. “In the wake of the recent wildfires, the health of our coral reefs and the quality of the surrounding waters remain top priorities for us. Our partners are currently conducting thorough studies to assess the impact. We stand ready to respond and take action based on their findings.” The road to recovery is long, and the community and natural resources are still suffering greatly.  . As we await more data on the reefs’ condition, our focus remains on aiding the community’s recovery and preparing for the challenges ahead. The Community Resilience Fund is one way we’re contributing to these efforts, and we  .  Your support enables us to extend our reach and impact, ready to respond when our communities and coral reefs need us most.

        "content": "Hang tight, because we’re about to clear up one of the ocean’s biggest misconceptions.  Have you ever looked at a coral reef and thought, “Wow, what a beautiful plant… or is it a rock?” You’re not alone in the confusion. But here’s the scoop: corals are actually animals, and they’re as lively and complex as the ocean itself. We’re diving into the world of corals to debunk some common misconceptions and reveal the truth about these vibrant underwater communities. The appearance of corals can lead to two common misconceptions – that they’re either plants or just inanimate rocks. Let’s explore why neither is true by taking a closer look at both soft and hard corals. Soft corals, including sea fans, sea pens, and blue corals, belong to the Octocorallia group and challenge the plant misconception with their graceful, swaying movements. Unlike plants,   don’t photosynthesize but have a symbiotic relationship with algae that do. Supported by spiny structures called sclerites rather than a hard skeleton, soft corals exhibit the flexibility and dynamism characteristic of animal life, contributing significantly to the reef’s ecosystem by offering shelter and a vibrant backdrop for marine life. Hard corals, or stony corals, form the rigid, complex structures often mistaken for rocks. These corals are colonies of tiny polyps that secrete calcium carbonate, forming a hard skeleton that is the foundation of coral reef ecosystems.   ability to build and shape the underwater landscape showcases their role as living, dynamic animals. They capture food, engage in symbiotic relationships, and respond to environmental changes, far from the static existence of a rock. A common myth is that corals grow in the same manner as plants. While corals do grow and spread over time, their method of growth is distinctly animal.   by cloning themselves, a process where a single polyp divides into two or more new polyps, expanding the colony. This asexual reproduction, known as budding, is a trait shared with other animals, not plants. Moreover, corals can also  , releasing eggs and sperm into the water to create new coral larvae. This dual strategy for growth and reproduction underscores their animal nature, differing significantly from plant growth and reproduction mechanisms. The presence of zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae living within most corals, leads to the misconception that corals themselves perform photosynthesis. While these algae do photosynthesize within the coral’s tissues, providing essential nutrients, the coral itself is not capable of photosynthesis. This relationship is a form of mutualism where both the coral (animal) and the algae (plant) benefit, further emphasizing the coral’s role as an animal that depends on its relationship with plant-like organisms for survival, rather than being a plant itself. Another myth is that, unlike animals, corals do not respond to their environment. In reality, corals have a sophisticated relationship with their surroundings. They can sense changes in light, temperature, and water chemistry, adjusting their behavior accordingly. For example, corals can expel their symbiotic algae when water temperatures become too high, a stress response known as  . While this is a defensive mechanism, it highlights corals’ sensitivity and responsiveness to environmental changes, traits characteristic of animals. These vibrant ecosystems, crafted by small yet resilient animals, highlight the ocean’s incredible resilience and diversity. Recognizing corals as living entities prompts us to reevaluate our relationship with the marine environment. This understanding serves as a call to action, urging us to adopt more responsible behaviors and make choices that support the health of our oceans. By acknowledging our role in this ecosystem, we’re invited to contribute positively to the preservation of coral reefs and the rich biodiversity they sustain."

In the world of conservation, MPAs are a key strategy for safeguarding the most lively and endangered parts of our oceans. These are special areas–managed by a variety of stakeholders, including governments, local communities, and organizations like ours–that vary from places with strict regulations around sustainability to spots where human access is completely restricted. These areas are crucial for protecting marine life and their homes, while also allowing for responsible human interaction with these vital ecosystems. , shielding them from threats like overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. By offering safe breeding grounds, MPAs do more than just conserve biodiversity; they also help replenish fish stocks, supporting both the natural environment and the economies of coastal communities. This dual benefit is a testament to the essential role MPAs play in maintaining ocean health. Moreover,  , offering insights into marine ecology and helping to refine conservation efforts to bolster the resilience of marine ecosystems around the globe. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) play a pivotal role in the health and sustainability of our oceans. Among the diverse types of MPAs,  . In these areas, all forms of extractive activities, including fishing, drilling, and mining, are prohibited. This absolute protection is designed to allow marine ecosystems to recover and flourish, undisturbed by human interference, making them vital sanctuaries for endangered species and biodiversity hotspots. On the other hand,  . These areas are designed to harmonize environmental protection with human needs, allowing for sustainable fishing, responsible tourism, and even some level of resource extraction. The goal is to ensure these activities do not compromise the ecological integrity of the marine environment. By implementing a carefully managed plan, multiple-use MPAs can support local economies, providing livelihoods for communities while still prioritizing the conservation of marine life and habitats. Dr. Helen Fox, our Conservation Science Director, has helped shed new light on how effective these MPAs can be. She has   showing that  . Even in places where human activity is high, multiple-use MPAs can work just as well as no-take zones in helping marine life flourish and supporting the people who live nearby. This finding is crucial because it shows we need all types of MPAs to keep our oceans healthy and resilient. Thanks to Dr. Fox’s insights, we’re learning that the right balance of protection and sustainable use in MPAs can make a big difference for both our marine environments and local communities. It’s about finding ways to protect our oceans while also considering the needs of those who depend on them. The success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is deeply intertwined with the active participation of local communities. By marrying traditional knowledge with the latest in conservation science, MPAs foster a profound sense of responsibility and care among those who live by the sea.  From the vibrant ecosystems of the Galápagos Marine Reserve to the historical sites within the USS Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, MPAs protect a wide range of unique habitats and species. Despite covering just a fraction of the ocean’s vast expanse, these areas are critical to global marine conservation efforts, contributing significantly to the overall health of our oceans. In Honduras, for example, we’ve seen remarkable progress with over   now under effective management and protection, partly thanks to the introduction of locally supported patrolling programs. This effort has been vital in protecting these areas from illegal activities and ensuring a thriving habitat for marine life. Our journey in marine conservation is evolving, with a keen focus on practical steps to protect our oceans. A prime example of this is our initiative to establish a new ‘no-take zone’ in Roatan, Honduras. This area, stretching from Sandy Bay to West Bay, is a critical reef ecosystem, highlighted by the discovery of vital fish spawning sites. To make this vision a reality, we’re teaming up with local communities, dive shops, and government bodies. Our approach is all about working together—educating, planning, and enforcing conservation strategies that everyone can stand behind. Together, we create a united front against overfishing and poaching, ensuring our marine life thrives. This effort in Roatan is just the beginning. We believe in the power of community-driven conservation to spark widespread change, safeguarding our oceans for the future. Join us as we continue to protect these vital ecosystems, one step at a time."

        "content": "Hey ocean explorers and land dwellers alike!  Picture this: you’re lounging on a beach, soaking up the sun’s warm embrace, listening to the rhythmic melody of crashing waves. It’s the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. But have you ever stopped to ponder the hidden heroes beneath the waves that make these idyllic moments possible?  As we usher in Earth Month, our attention turns to one of the planet’s most vital and vibrant ecosystems: coral reefs—the bustling metropolises of the ocean. They’re not just colorful coral gardens;    Coral reefs form the backbone of marine life and have a profound impact on our existence above water. Despite covering less than one percent of the ocean floor,  , including thousands of fish species, invertebrates, and sea mammals This incredible biodiversity not only sustains marine life but also supports human populations around the globe in ways that are often unseen but deeply felt. So, let’s take a deep dive into five surprising ways coral reefs are intricately connected to our daily existence. First up, let’s talk about  , the life-giving elixir that fuels our every breath. Coral reefs might be out of sight, but they’re certainly not out of mind when it comes to oxygen production. In fact,  Through photosynthesis, corals and algae work their magic, converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, all while creating a vibrant underwater oasis. So, next time you take a deep breath of fresh air, spare a thought for the coral reefs working tirelessly beneath the waves to keep our atmosphere in balance. Now, onto  , the atmospheric dance that dictates our daily forecast. You might be surprised to learn that  . As climate change takes its toll on these delicate ecosystems, the ripple effects extend far beyond the reef itself. Changes in coral health can lead to disruptions in ocean currents, altering temperature gradients and atmospheric circulation patterns.  The result? Stronger storms, unpredictable weather, and a cascade of consequences that reverberate across continents. By safeguarding coral reefs, we’re not just protecting marine life; we’re also safeguarding our climate and weather systems for generations to come. —those sun-soaked getaways we dream about all year long. Whether you’re snorkeling among vibrant coral gardens or basking in the sun on pristine white sands, coral reefs add an extra layer of magic to our seaside adventures.  But here’s the catch:   Coral bleaching, pollution, and overfishing threaten to mar the beauty of our favorite coastal destinations, putting a damper on our holiday escapades. By supporting coral conservation efforts, we can ensure that future generations can continue to experience the awe-inspiring wonders of the ocean. Now, let’s delve into medical mysteries, the untapped potential of  . Beneath the waves lies a treasure trove of bioactive compounds, waiting to be discovered and harnessed for human health.   These marine marvels offer a glimmer of hope in the fight against some of our most pressing health concerns. By preserving coral reefs, we’re not just protecting biodiversity; we’re also safeguarding a source of inspiration and innovation for future medical breakthroughs. Our     serve as the lifelines that connect us to the ocean’s depths. From rivers to streams, our waterways serve as conduits for everything from freshwater runoff to industrial waste. And where does it all end up? You guessed it—the ocean.  , facing the consequences of pollution, sedimentation, and habitat destruction. By taking steps to clean up our act on land (and in our ground water), we can help ensure that our underwater neighbors continue to thrive. As you navigate Earth Month, remember that our lives are deeply intertwined with the health of coral reefs. From the air we breathe to the vacations we cherish, these underwater ecosystems touch us in more ways than we realize. Let’s pledge to protect and preserve them, ensuring that future generations can continue to marvel at their beauty and benefit from their bounty. After all, when it comes to coral reefs, the connections run deep.   With your help, we can ensure that coral reefs remain vibrant and resilient for generations to come.  The connection is clear: by protecting coral reefs, we’re not just saving a distant underwater world. We’re safeguarding our future on land."

        "content": "June 7, 2011 – The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) today announced that its board of directors has selected Dr. Michael Webster, expert in coral reef ecology, program officer at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and former post-doctoral researcher with the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) at Oregon State University, to serve as CORAL’s new executive director. “I am honored to have the opportunity to build on CORAL’s solid foundation and continue to improve the effectiveness and scope of coral reef conservation,” said Dr. Webster. “Coral reefs have been my passion for as long as I can remember, and their future will depend on the decisions that people make in this generation. CORAL is well-positioned to ensure that those decisions promote vibrant, healthy reefs for generations to come.” As a program officer at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation since 2004, Dr. Webster developed and managed a portfolio of more than $40 million in grants focused on the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of Pacific aquatic ecosystems. Building effective relationships between funders and local conservation groups and researchers was an integral part of his success at the foundation. He will rely on this experience in his new role at CORAL, where he will be charged with enhancing our community-based coral reef conservation initiatives. “We are pleased that we were able to find such a strong leader to build on the legacy of former executive director Brian Huse and lead CORAL into an exciting new chapter,” said H. William Jesse, Jr., CORAL’s board chair. “Dr. Webster brings with him an outstanding reputation for science-based conservation that will create new opportunities for CORAL to expand our reef conservation efforts.” Dr. Webster coordinated the scientific activities of a long-term ecosystem research and monitoring project across four universities while at PISCO. The project addressed questions about the ecology and oceanography of the California Current Ecosystem. Prior to working at PISCO, Dr. Webster earned his doctorate in coral reef fish ecology while working in the Bahamas and Australia. “Dr. Webster’s expertise represents the perfect mix of science and management, both of which are essential for CORAL’s mission,” said Dr. Nancy Knowlton, Sant Chair for Marine Science at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, adjunct professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and CORAL board member. “His experience leading several of the most distinguished marine research and conservation efforts in the U.S. is an enormous asset for CORAL.” Dr. Webster, who will be based in San Francisco, will begin his official duties later this summer. Handling his duties until then will be interim Executive Director and Conservation Programs Director Rick MacPherson. ### \nThe Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) unites communities to save coral reefs.

        "content": "September 30, 2011 -The Republic of the Marshall Islands is now home to the largest shark sanctuary in the world. The new legislation officially bans the commercial fishing of sharks in all 1,990,530 square kilometers of the nation’s waters, an area equivalent to the size of Mexico. The Marshall Islands joins Palau, Honduras, Tokelau, the Maldives, and the Bahamas in prohibiting the commercial fishing of sharks in their nation’s waters. “We salute the Republic of the Marshall Islands for recognizing the importance of healthy shark populations to our oceans,” said Matt Rand, director of global shark conservation for the Pew Environment Group, the organization which is spearheading efforts to establish shark sanctuaries where targeted fishing for the species is prohibited. “The momentum for protecting these animals continues to spread across the globe, creating greater areas where they can thrive without the threats of commercial fishing.” The news of the Marshall Islands comes as Fiji’s government considers revisions to its own fisheries laws that would ban commercial shark fishing and the trade of shark fins and other products derived from sharks captured in national waters. \nThe Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), in partnership with the Pew Environment Group and the Fijian Ministry of Fisheries, is championing this new legislation. Through a targeted campaign determined to raise local support for a designated shark sanctuary, the team is educating communities in Fiji about the importance of sharks to both their history and their economy. “Fiji is home to a high diversity of sharks and many of these species are threatened with extinction globally,” said Manoa Rasigatale, a member of CORAL’s Fiji shark sanctuary campaign team. “It is time for the Fijian people to proudly stand alongside our brothers in the Central Pacific to ensure long-lasting protection for sharks.” The Fijian government is expected to issue an official decree before the year’s end.

        "content": "October 20, 2011 Suva, Fiji (Oct. 20, 2011)-Fiji’s reputation as a leader in marine conservation may be enhanced if a proposal made by the Ministry of Primary Industries’ Department of Fisheries and Forests advances next month. The agency is considering measures that would ban the commercial fishing and trade of sharks and their parts, including fins. The proposal is being drafted, and if it advances in the Cabinet, new legislation could be in place before year’s end. The government has the support of traditional leaders, as well as the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and the Pew Environment Group, nonprofit organizations that this week will launch a campaign to raise community awareness about the importance of sharks in Fiji. “A national shark sanctuary in Fiji would be a huge victory for these animals,” said Matt Rand, director of global shark conservation for the Pew Environment Group. “This action would close down a major hub in the Pacific for the trafficking of fins and highlight Fiji as home to the world’s second-largest shark sanctuary.” The proposed Fiji National Shark Sanctuary, encompassing the country’s 1.3-million-square-kilometer Exclusive Economic Zone, would be the first of its kind in Melanesia. It is modeled after similar conservation measures in the Marshall Islands, Palau, the Maldives, Honduras, the Bahamas, and Tokelau. According to Fisheries Department annual reports, the country’s exports in 2003 were 180 metric tons of shark products. Most of Fiji’s shark fins are exported. “We don’t eat shark,” said Ratu Lalabalavu, who has expressed support for a national shark sanctuary in his capacity as the traditional leader of the Tovata Confederacy. “We feel that we are doing justice to something that is very much part of our life and our history in protecting sharks.” The heads of the Burebasaga Confederacy and Kubuna Confederacy also support the designation of Fijian waters for shark conservation. “The Fijian people have a long history of supporting locally-managed marine areas,” said Rick MacPherson, conservation programs director at CORAL. “This strong cultural connection to the reefs makes our job easier as we work alongside the Fijian community to develop an effective sanctuary for sharks that benefits both the marine ecosystem and the people who rely on it. This shark movement is an excellent opportunity for us to use our resources to unite a nation to protect marine ecosystems.” Sharks are significant to the health of coral reefs. “A reef without sharks is a sick reef,” said Demian Chapman, PhD, a shark scientist at Stony Brook University in New York, who in March provided an assessment of the shark fin trade for fisheries officials in Fiji’s capital, Suva. As top ocean predators, sharks regulate the populations of prey species and potentially the overall health of the ocean, according to Chapman. Falling populations of these animals might even lead to general coral reef decline. “There is a clear empirical association between thriving shark populations and healthy coral reef ecosystems,” he said. Chapman found that the shark fin trade in Suva includes the sale of thousands of fins from sharks that are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, such as scalloped hammerhead (Endangered) and silky, blacktip reef, and bull sharks (all Near Threatened). His assessment also found trade in fins from shark species that live and breed on the reef, and are important for ecotourism. Earlier this year, the Australian Institute for Marine Studies found that reef sharks in Palau contribute nearly US$18 million annually to the national economy through diving and associated tourism activities. A similar analysis in French Polynesia found that an individual lemon shark has a lifetime value of more than US$300,000, a significantly higher figure than if it had been caught for its fins. “A living shark is worth far more than a dead shark,” said Rand. The launch event Monday, Oct. 24, at Suva’s Village 6 theater, includes the screening of a 30-minute documentary called “Shark Hope,” which is about the plight of Fiji’s sharks and efforts to protect them. It chronicles the importance of these animals to Fiji’s culture through myths and stories, as well as the critical role they play in maintaining a healthy marine environment. The film features Ratu Lalabalavu, whose traditional title is Gone Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau, and Ratu Manoa Rasagitale, who is a Fijian cultural icon, former senator, and reality television personality. # # # The Pew Environment Group is the conservation arm of The Pew \nCharitable Trusts, a nongovernmental organization that works globally to \nestablish pragmatic, science-based policies that protect our \noceans, preserve our wildlands, and promote clean energy.

        "content": "November 25, 2011  – The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI) is pleased to welcome Thomas Meller, an expert in environmental tourism operations, sustainable hotel management, and conservation planning, as its newly appointed director general. Established in 2006, MARTI is a joint initiative of the Coral Reef Alliance, Amigos de Sian Ka’an, the Riviera Maya Hotel Association, the Rainforest Alliance, Grupo Intersectorial, and Sustainable Travel International. MARTI works with private, public, and civil groups-throughout the Mexican Caribbean-to implement effective environmental best practices that reduce negative tourism impacts on the marine environment. In his new leadership role, Thomas is tasked with creating new opportunities to deepen the organization’s engagement with marine recreation providers, cruise ships, hotels, and hotel developers throughout the region. “In five years, MARTI has become the most important sustainable tourism initiative in the Mesoamerican Reef region,” said Thomas Meller. “I am thrilled to serve as MARTI’s first director general. I look forward to integrating the individual strengths and expertise of our six partners to build an even stronger initiative that will achieve our vision-transforming tourism into a force for biodiversity conservation and sustainable community development.” Thomas brings to this new role over eighteen years of experience managing and implementing environmental projects. While working with the United Nations Development Programme in Jamaica, he managed the UN’s extensive environmental project portfolio, including the 2.3 million USD Typhoid Control and Prevention Program, which among other things improved wastewater treatment infrastructure in the Savanna la Mar area. After completing his postgraduate studies in environmental management at the University of Applied Economics in Berlin, he returned to Jamaica to put his skills to use improving environmental practices within the island’s expanding hotel industry. In 2000, he relocated to the Mexican Caribbean where he provided environmental hotel management consulting services as part of USAID’s Quintana Roo sustainable tourism project. During this time, he helped the first hotel in Mexico to achieve Green Globe certification, which at the time was considered the travel industry’s prime international standard for sustainability. Over the past five years, Thomas has served as MARTI’s director of hotel development and operations within Amigos de Sian Ka’an, a Cancun-based nonprofit working for the conservation of the Mexican Caribbean’s ecosystems. During this time, Thomas developed MARTI’s environmental best practices guidelines and concluded his assignment with the publication of the initiative’s Sustainable Planning, Design, and Construction Guide for the Mexican Caribbean. “Thomas holds an impressive depth of organizational knowledge and qualifications that make him the ideal candidate for this position,” said Rick MacPherson, Conservation Programs Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, a founding partner of MARTI. “Thomas co-developed many of the tools we use in the field today to advance the initiative and has been instrumental in brokering key relationships within the tourism industry.

        "content": "November 13, 2012 A recent discovery reveals coral cover reminiscent of 30 years ago Honduras Reefs—A unique dive site, previously unknown to the scientific community, has been discovered by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), The Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI), and their local partners near the coastal town of Tela, Honduras. The reef is so exceptional that the local municipal government recently declared it a marine protected area, and CORAL is now launching an effort with local officials, conservation groups, and business owners to ensure its future protection. Divers who have the opportunity to visit this area will get an extraordinary glimpse of what a Caribbean reef looked like nearly thirty years ago. The healthy reef includes an area known as Capiro Banks, which boasts an astounding 69 percent live coral cover. With the average coral cover in the Caribbean today at less than 20 percent, the reef is a rare find. Furthermore, the reef boasts an unusually high concentration of Diadema sea urchins—important reef grazers whose populations plummeted in the 1980s. And just northwest of Capiro Banks, adjacent to a terrestrial park, the team recorded more than 800 critically endangered elkhorn corals. This important reef-building coral provides valuable habitat for marine life. “These reefs along the Caribbean mainland of Honduras are quite remarkable,” noted Jason Vasques, Assistant Director of Conservation Programs at CORAL. “The discovery of Capiro Banks is surprising because here is a remarkable reef that has no business being where it is. Despite increasing pressure from nearby nutrient-rich and sediment laden rivers and watersheds, this coral oasis appears to be thriving. While many elkhorn coral populations have collapsed throughout the Caribbean due to disease outbreaks, bleaching, and numerous other localized impacts, this particular reef is defying the odds. It may also be a critical source of coral spawn that could potentially allow this endangered species to repopulate the region.” The declaration of the marine protected area near Tela was based in part on reef monitoring data collected by CORAL and HRI as part of the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) program. After the team presented its findings to the Honduras Vice-Minister of Tourism Synthia Bennett Soleman and David Zacaro, the Mayor of Tela, Zacaro wasted no time in making the declaration. “We are very excited about this newly protected area,” he shared, “but we also understand the great responsibility that has been put upon our shoulders. We must work tirelessly together in order to ensure the future of this beautiful gift, so that future generations can also enjoy the benefits of our amazing reefs.” The protection of the reef area near Tela follows a significant decision made by the Honduran government earlier this year to designate Cordelia Banks a Site of Wildlife Importance. Located not far from Tela, off the southwest coast of Roatan, Honduras, Cordelia is home to one of the Caribbean’s largest known stands of staghorn coral—an IUCN-listed critically endangered species. Honduras, with the elkhorn coral at Tela and the staghorn coral in Cordelia, can now claim protections for significant populations of two endangered corals. Reports of Tela’s reefs are spreading quickly throughout the local tourism industry. Construction has just broke ground on the new Tela Marine Research Center. This facility is expected to serve as an educational resource for the greater public about coral reef conservation and will accommodate the needs of approximately 30 to 40 divers each day. Marcello Dicunta, a PADI dive instructor and owner of the Tela Dive Center, is looking forward to the possibilities arising from this discovery. “Seasoned divers will find Tela’s reef different from anything they have seen before. And because it’s so different, we need to ask important questions like why are the coral coverage and sea urchin populations thriving here. Compared to the rest of the Caribbean, Capiro Banks is a very healthy reef and it’s worth preserving so that we can spend time studying it.” Antal Borcsok, member of the Tela Chamber of Tourism’s Board of Directors, also sees tremendous potential for the area. “This incredible news has sent shock waves throughout the entrepreneurial veins of the people of Tela. We recognize how important it is to act quickly and responsibly to ensure a long-term, sustainable source of income for the community.” CORAL and its partners are already preparing for the potential impact that added dive tourism will have on the reefs near Tela. Recent programs include installing moorings to reduce anchor damage to sensitive reef habitats, training local marine operators and community teachers in sustainable marine recreation principles, and working with federal authorities to eventually designate Tela’s reefs a Site of Wildlife Importance. “It is critical that political and private interests align to protect these amazing reefs,” said Vasques. “We look forward to being involved in this locally-driven movement and are committed to helping the community of Tela protect its reefs.”"

        "content": "We recently held our annual State of the Reef Address, which highlighted the urgent need for action to protect coral reefs. Heather Starck, the Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance, emphasized the devastating impact of climate change, overfishing, pollution, and other human activities on coral reefs around the world. Coral reefs are critical ecosystems that provide food and livelihoods for millions of people; their preservation is vital. Heather stressed that coral reefs are still in decline. This means that nearly 1 trillion dollars annually in food, tourism, and coastal protection are in jeopardy. Our science is telling us that 75% of reefs are currently threatened and this figure is anticipated to climb to 90% by 2030. “We’re also seeing that  in the Western Caribbean is spreading at 155 meters per day” according to Heather and the CORAL team scientists. This is a highly lethal disease that started in 2014 and continues to spread rapidly across the Caribbean. While there’s urgency to act, the team at CORAL has reason for hope. Starck shared with us that, “for example, 341 commitments worth nearly $20 billion were recently made at the   this month in Panama including funding for expanding and improving marine protected areas and biodiversity corridors.” We find hope in the fact that 193 countries within the UN agreed to the first of its kind high seas treaty to protect 30 percent of our lands and Oceans by 2030. Starck described CORAL’s science-based approach for addressing the needs of the world’s coral reefs. This includes supporting resilient coastal communities, reducing water pollution, and promoting sustainable fisheries – all of which we believe will allow coral reefs to adapt and survive as they face global climate change. Next  , CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, shared exciting updates on the progress made by her team in advancing the science around coral adaptation and evolution. This is in hopes that reefs to adapt to the environmental changes brought on by climate change. Dr. Fox’s team has been working with the  , a new resource that maps the world’s coral reefs and monitors their threats to provide actionable data and a shared understanding of coral ecosystems. CORAL is part of the Atlas partnership and is leading the coordination of the field component of coral bleaching monitoring program. One day, we hope to  that helps to improve the detection of bleaching events from space. The most engaging addition to the State of the Reef Address this year was live video streaming to field sites in both the Western Caribbean and Hawaii. , CORAL’s Conservation Program Director, and Francis Lam, Executive Director of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras, spoke about their work in the region. One of the main programs at the Roatan Marine Park is the patrol program, which has five boats of rangers who survey this protected marine zone and deter illegal fishing and other activities that counteract local community efforts to improve the environment. CORAL’s holistic approach to supporting local organizations has made a real difference in coral reef health in the Western Caribbean, as evidenced by the growth and impact of the Roatan Marine Park. Next we went to the Mauka (mountains) of Maui where our Hawaiian Islands Program Coordinator,  , and team are working on sedimentation, a critical issue in the Waikoli watershed of West Maui. They are decommissioning agricultural roads that run parallel to stream gulches and installing plants to trap the sediment.  Our approach is intended to be a long-term, nature-based solution to the problem of stormwater run-off depositing tons of sediment suffocating the corals. The Coral Reef Alliance plans to scale up its work to meet the growing needs of coral reefs, and the organization depends on the support of its community to succeed. The  , Kirby Ryan, expressed gratitude to everyone for their ongoing support and involvement in the Alliance’s work despite the challenges of the pandemic. Looking forward, we plan to continue urgent and important work to protect and restore coral reefs globally, with the hope of gaining more support from people who are interested in preserving this critical natural wonder that supports 25% of ocean life and hundreds of millions of people. CORAL’s 2023 State of the Reef Address has emphasized the pressing need for action to protect coral reefs. Through the work of scientists, conservationists, and local communities, we hope to preserve these critical ecosystems for future generations.

The collection takes an additional step by sourcing recycled polyester as its fabric. Regarding this deliberate product decision, Matthew Parvis acknowledges, “What we are truly striving for at Fresh Clean Threads is to introduce innovative technologies that enable us to ensure that this polyester has a significantly reduced environmental impact.” Fresh Clean Threads is deeply committed to reducing its plastic consumption, particularly in packaging and shipping materials. As part of their sustainability journey, the company has made significant changes, such as replacing traditional poly-mailers with compostable mailers made from cornstarch. These innovative mailers break down within months, in stark contrast to the hundreds of years conventional plastic takes to degrade. According to Matthew Parvis, this transition represents the “second step” in their pursuit of becoming fully green. The first step involves making meaningful contributions to ocean conservation efforts, exemplified by their support for organizations like CORAL. The third step will ensure sustainable practices throughout the fabric production process by carefully selecting factories that share their values, all of which forms a crucial part of their responsible approach. In addition to their packaging changes, Fresh Clean Threads has eliminated plastic tape, opting instead for fully recyclable water-activated paper tape. Plastic packaging for their products has been replaced with compostable bags made from plant-based materials. Despite recognizing that ethical considerations may not always be the primary factor in purchasing decisions, the company considers these choices as fundamental pillars of their brand. Matthew Parvis expresses a strong desire for greater awareness of environmental issues, including the detrimental impact of companies, to take center stage. In the past, the company has partnered with a handful of non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting the world’s oceans, and CORAL is grateful to now be a part of the Fresh Clean Threads community. Beyond donating a portion of its profits to CORAL and being our match donor for our springtime campaign, our partners have dedicated their   collection to our mission. This decision heightens the awareness and urgency for coral conservation and best practices to Fresh Clean Threads’ consumer base. In this way, Fresh Clean Threads is a part of the solution instead of part of the problem.    Fresh Clean Threads has recognized the importance of sustainability and is taking concrete steps to reduce its impact on the environment. The Fresh Clean Seas initiative, focused on reducing single-use plastic and supporting ocean conservation efforts, is an excellent example of how businesses can be environmentally responsible while still being profitable. The driving ideology behind the company is “clothes that don’t wear on the planet.” This statement goes beyond the physical article of clothing, which has the potential of influencing its consumers for the greater good. Awareness provides shoppers the opportunity to make environmentally sustainable decisions all while educating them about the need for coral reef conservation. CORAL is proud to align itself with Fresh Clean Threads, and we’re enthusiastic to see this partnership grow. Join us on our journey to make the ocean a healthier place for those that live above and below its surface."

The app is called   and it’s a tool being used by conservationists around the world to protect wildlife and its natural habitats.  Thanks to our local partners, dedicated patrol rangers, and your generous support, we are expanding access to this technology and using it to address illegal fishing in the Western Caribbean and protect the region’s coral reefs.  SMART improves the management of marine protected areas by allowing patrol rangers to track activities and record observations in one simple data system. With just the click of a button, we can now view valuable data that helps on-the-ground teams be proactive, strategic, and efficient when guarding marine protected areas.  By providing training and access to the tool, our local partners like the   and the   have improved their patrolling programs and can better protect waters that suffer from illegal fishing.  “We can get precise information and immediately download the reports that we need,” says Francis Leán, the executive director for the RMP. According to Leán, her team no longer relies on estimations and can now accurately analyze the number of illegal fishing incidents and species confiscated, in addition to the mileage covered and amount of fuel used by patrol rangers.  “By using this technology, we understand all the components involved in running a successful patrolling program,” says Pamela Ortega, CORAL’s program manager. “It helps make informed decisions and it can advise other communities or groups in the industry.”  An effective patrol program is important because it protects healthy fish populations, which greatly contribute to coral reef health. Herbivorous fish, like parrotfish or surgeonfish, graze on the seaweed that grows near reefs. When you remove too many of these fish from the environment, algae can take over reef-building corals and the ecosystem can quickly collapse. Overfishing impacts coral reefs and the species that rely on them, in addition to many coastal communities who depend on reef fish as a source of income and food. That’s why we are so committed to our   strategy which includes utilizing technology, implementing robust patrolling programs, and supporting local partners whose work directly impacts coral reef health. In the upcoming year, we hope to expand the use of SMART and offer more technical expertise to patrolling programs in the Western Caribbean. Thanks to generous donations, we are able to help local communities and our partners reach these goals and protect the coral reefs we know and love. "

        "content": "So, picture this: you’ve just arrived at your dream tropical destination, ready to explore the crystal-clear waters and the vibrant underwater world. As you strap on your snorkeling gear and dive into the ocean, you’re immediately transported into a magical world of colors and shapes. The water is warm, the sun is shining, and the fish are curiously swimming around you. You feel like you’re in a dream. But suddenly, something catches your eye. As you approach a group of corals, you notice that something’s not quite right. The once-vibrant pink and green hues have faded, and the coral looks pale, white even. You swim closer, hoping it’s just a trick of the light, but as you get nearer, the reality sinks in: the coral is bleached. Corals are animals, but they live in a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae. These algae provide the corals with food and oxygen, and in return, the corals provide them with a safe place to live. It’s a win-win situation! However, when corals are exposed to stressful conditions, such as high temperatures, pollution, or changes in the water’s chemistry, they expel the zooxanthellae. Without them, the coral loses its color and turns white, hence the term “bleaching.” Corals can not live very long in this state. But here’s the good news: coral bleaching doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the reef. If the stressor is removed in time, the zooxanthellae can come back and the corals can recover. Together, we should care about coral bleaching because coral reefs are essential to the health of our oceans and our planet. They provide a home and a source of food for countless species of fish and other marine creatures. They also protect coastlines from erosion and storms, and play a vital role in regulating the Earth’s climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. When coral reefs suffer, so do the ecosystems and the people that depend on them. Additionally, coral reefs are a stunning display of biodiversity and natural beauty, and their loss would be a tragedy for future generations. By taking action to prevent and mitigate coral bleaching, we can help protect one of our planet’s most precious resources. The   at the Coral Reef Alliance is focused on early detection of bleaching events so that we can identify reefs in need of our protection.  For example, if a bleaching event has started in an area with many tourist divers, we can influence local stakeholders to limit visitors to that reef until it can have time to recover. Through this program we have collaborators monitoring events in the water and we are also partnering with the   to help improve their satellite-based technology  to identify bleaching in near-real time. There are many things you can do to help protect coral reefs and prevent coral bleaching. One of the most important is to reduce your carbon footprint by using less energy and supporting policies that address climate change. You can also reduce your impact on coral reefs by being a responsible traveler, choosing reef-safe sunscreens and more sustainable seafood, and avoiding activities that can damage coral, such as anchoring on reefs or touching coral. Finally, you can support organizations like the Coral Reef Alliance that work to protect and restore coral reefs around the world.  Coral bleaching is a serious threat to coral reefs and the many species that depend on them. By understanding the causes and impacts of coral bleaching and taking action to reduce our impact on the environment, we can help protect these important ecosystems for generations to come."

        "title": "CORAL Position Statement- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Releases Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5° C",
        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "On October 8th, the IPCC issued its special report on the impacts of global climate change on nature and society. Specifically, the IPCC examined the results of warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the context of the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. The report can be found at  . The report paints a grim picture of the consequences of climate change if the earth’s temperature rises by even 0.5°C and further states that rising temperatures will result in food shortages, more wildfires, and—of particular interest to us at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL)—a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Additionally, the report points out that the effects of climate change will not be disbursed uniformly across the globe. Rising temperatures will have a disproportionate impact on the poor as well as developing and island nations. CORAL works closely with many such communities around the world to implement solutions that are win-wins for both reefs and people. Many media outlets have covered the release of this report, and many have focused on the predictions of devastating effects to coral reefs. Some of the reports have shared inaccurate data about the current state of coral reefs and very few media outlets have publicized the work being done by CORAL and countless other conservation organizations around the world to save coral reefs. The IPCC’s special report is an urgent wake-up call for action. To save coral reefs, we must act on two fronts: we must swiftly and drastically   while simultaneously effectively  , such as from land-based sources of pollution and overfishing. Without effective action on both fronts in the next 20 years, we could be facing a world without functional coral reefs. CORAL has developed innovative, scientific solutions to meet this challenge. . A quarter of all marine life depends on coral reefs, and over 500 million people around the world rely on coral reefs for food security, economic well-being, and cultural identity. Goods and services—like tourism and fishing—derived from coral reefs have an estimated value of US$375 billion a year. Coral reefs are also critical for protecting coastal communities from wave action, erosion, and tropical storms. The world needs coral reefs, and decisive action will help ensure that we do not face a future without them. Many coral reefs around the globe are in a state of decline. Some recent reports in the media have stated that we have lost 50 percent of the world’s reefs already. The truth is more complicated. The combination of rising ocean temperatures and local reef threats has resulted in the loss of 50 percent of reef-building corals (as opposed to coral reefs) over the past 30 years and placed an estimated one-third of reef-building corals at risk of extinction. The good news is that there is hope for corals and coral reefs.  , but little is known about whether corals can adapt fast enough to keep up with the pace of climate change. Without this crucial information, pessimism can prevail, undermining motivation to implement effective conservation actions and governmental policies. CORAL is developing a new, scalable solution to meet the crisis facing our reefs, as described in the IPCC report, that will fill this knowledge gap. In partnership with world-class researchers, we are spearheading a multidisciplinary research project that is improving our understanding of how corals evolve in response to rising temperatures. We are using this scientific information to develop regional-scale conservation plans that we are implementing in collaboration with local communities in  ,  ,   and  . Our scientific research shows that the best way to give corals a fighting chance is by facilitating the natural process of evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue happens when a population in decline is able to survive because individuals that are naturally better suited to deal with new conditions breed to regrow the population. In essence, evolution rescues the population before it goes extinct. We have used our scientific research to define the attributes of networks that increase the probability of evolutionary rescue. We call these networks “Adaptive Reefscapes”. An Adaptive Reefscape is a network of healthy reefs that is diverse, connected, and large.  To learn more about Adaptive Reefscapes go to:  . A key element of Adaptive Reefscapes is that they are based on portfolio theory—the idea that investing in a diverse range of options for the future increases the chances for success. This contrasts with other approaches that use inherently uncertain forecasts to focus conservation efforts on particular geographic locations and/or species. Such strategies are intrinsically risky. Adaptive Reefscapes also contrasts with approaches that are over-reliant on technology which, given the short window of time and resource constraints, are unlikely to achieve meaningful results for reefs at a global scale. Given the rapid pace of climate change and its drastic effects, we can no longer rely on standard approaches to conservation that assume we know what the future will bring or that strive to return systems to the way they once were. We need innovative solutions that instead embrace the idea of change and harness evolutionary power. To address the crisis we face, we need a solution that can scale globally in a relatively short period and with limited resources. At CORAL, we have that solution. Find out how you can get involved and learn more at  . As CORAL’s Program Director, Dr. Madhavi Colton oversees an international portfolio of community-driven conservation programs that are addressing local threats to reefs, including over-fishing, poor water quality, sedimentation, and habitat destruction. Madhavi is also spearheading new scientific research into how ecosystems adapt to the effects of anthropogenic climate change and is applying this knowledge to develop innovative approaches to coral conservation around the world. Her expertise lies in building partnerships between academic researchers, conservation organizations, governments and local communities to implement durable solutions to conservation.

        "content": "Coral reefs are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, providing critical habitat for countless species of fish, invertebrates, and other marine life. Unfortunately, coral reefs are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms. This has led to a decline in the health and resilience of many coral reefs, which in turn has negatively impacted the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them for food, income, and cultural identity. To address these challenges, a team of researchers from University of Leeds (UK), Coral Reef Alliance (USA), Rare (Philippines & Indonesia), Pattimura University (Indonesia), and many other partners are  . These two nations are part of “The Coral Triangle” – a region in the western Pacific Ocean that is known for its incredible marine biodiversity and rich coral reef ecosystems. It is often referred to as the “Amazon of the Seas” due to its vast array of marine life and is considered one of the most important and diverse marine regions on Earth.  The new project is called  Led by Dr. Maria Beger of University of Leeds, Rocky Sanchez-Tirona of Rare, Dr. Gino Limmon of Pattimura University, and Dr. Helen Fox of CORAL, the project will   that depend on them. In particular, Climate REEFS aims to both develop techniques to identify adaptive reefs using remote sensing technologies and characterize how gender and social status shape socio-economic vulnerabilities and the ability to adapt to reef degradation. Its ultimate goal is to strengthen community capacity for sustainable fisheries and to improve management of coral reef marine protected areas (MPAs). Climate REEFS will involve a range of activities, including social science research to identify climate vulnerability and gender- and socially inclusive adaptation pathways. It also involves geospatial research to detect adaptive reefs from satellite-derived data, as well as ecological and genomic research to pilot an analysis that tests the interplay of adaptiveness from genes to people. All activities will be conducted at a small scale, with the goal of training the team in key research techniques and identifying policy opportunities that will enable future expansion. Climate REEFS officially kicked off in the city of Cebu, the Philippines, where partners met from July 3 – 5 to discuss major work packages, finalize project timelines, and flesh out plans for the start of gathering data in the field, among other agenda items. The project team is currently working to select field sites for ecological coral reef surveys off the island of Leyte in the Philippines and is also working with nearby coastal communities. It’s expected that similar efforts will begin off the island of Ambon, Indonesia in October.   You can help us expand our work in the Coral Triangle by following the Climate REEFS project and sharing about it with friends, family, and followers. The more people who know about this work, the better. We’re confident this sharing of knowledge will influence how other communities manage their coral reef resources and influence donors to fund coral conservation and science."

        "content": "In the crystal clear waters surrounding Molokai, the legacy of Ka Honua Momona (KHM) spans generations, rooted in the island’s rich heritage. Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and Ka Honua Momona have recently joined hands in a shared commitment to preserving Hawaii’s precious coastal ecosystems. Their partnership aims to safeguard Molokai’s southern fringing reefs, a mission deeply woven into the longstanding dedication of KHM to this land. Hawaii’s coral reefs are not merely underwater ecosystems; they’re the lifeblood of the islands, sustaining nature, economy, and culture. The reefs of Molokai, with their rich biodiversity and cultural significance, face a looming crisis. Invasive species, mismanaged land, and unsustainable fishing are threatening to irreversibly damage these precious ecosystems, jeopardizing not only marine life but also the traditions, livelihoods, and well-being of the local communities. Studies by scientists at the University of Hawaii’s Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program have shown that south Molokai has the best coral coverage in the main eight Hawaiian Islands. Yet the impacts from sediment run-off into the nearshore ecosystem have caused areas of degradation of the south Molokai reef, affecting fish and coral habitats. Coral and fish larvae from this island are dispersed across Maui Nui and Oahu, helping to build resilience across a larger area. Molokai’s south shore is a close-knit community, primarily home to native Hawaiians whose families have lived on the island for generations. They’re deeply committed to preserving their unique Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions. Unfortunately, the island faces challenges due to limited job opportunities, leading to high unemployment rates and many residents living below the poverty line. Most available jobs are in agriculture, mainly with external companies managing plantations on the island. The community is aging as younger generations leave in search of better prospects. By teaming up with KHM for this project, we aim to support the community in maintaining their vital sources of food and income. Additionally, our research will assist in developing strategies for a sustainable future. The CORAL-KHM fishpond restoration project is a lifeline thrown into troubled waters, aiming to set Molokai’s reefs on a course of resilience and sustainability. Revitalizing two fishponds—named Alii and Kalokoeli—will significantly enhance the long-term health of the coral reefs along Molokai’s south shore.  This restoration effort involves removing invasive algae, reintroducing native plant species, and rejuvenating fish ponds to boost the fish population, which is crucial for nurturing healthy coral habitats. By creating healthier reef ecosystems, we’re not only promoting resilience but also fortifying the region against the impact of storms, hurricanes, and rising sea levels. Molokai hosts coral species found nowhere else in the world. We must protect these endemic species from extinction, ensuring the survival of unique marine life integral to the delicate balance of the ecosystem. Beyond ecological considerations, the project recognizes the intrinsic link between healthy reefs and Hawaiian culture. The revival of the reefs is an endeavor to safeguard cultural practices, ceremonies, and the traditional gathering of marine resources that have sustained communities for generations. We’ll be working in tight partnership with KHM whose staff have lineal ties to place and have kuleana (responsibility) in caring for Alii and Kalokoeli fishponds, which are community treasures and sources of education, food, cultural renewal and connection. As a result of this project’s efforts to improve habitat for fish and wildlife, we anticipate a simultaneous enhancement of community resilience. By addressing land mismanagement, invasive species, and sediment pollution, the project also aims to secure the economic lifeline that Molokai’s reefs provide. A thriving marine ecosystem provides a sustainable source of income and food for local communities. Hunting, fishing, and farming account for providing 33% of the island community’s food needs, and this reef is one of the major food sources for Molokai’s subsistence economy. As climate change intensifies, coral reefs face unprecedented challenges. One of our goals is to create conditions that enable reefs to adapt to the changing climate, ensuring their resilience in the face of warming oceans and other climate-related stressors. This includes healthy fish populations, as well as clean water free of sedimentation. Our future plans include establishing water quality monitoring protocols to ensure the reefs have proper conditions, as well as education around restoration and sustainable initiatives on the island. Through fishpond restoration, water quality monitoring, and community capacity-building, the CORAL-KHM partnership is not just about addressing immediate threats but building a foundation for long-term coral reef management. It’s a commitment to a sustainable future where Molokai’s reefs thrive, supporting ecosystems, cultures, and economies for generations to come."

Reef health is getting worse as years go by. In order to minimize stressors to the reef, we must first understand the cause. Is the decline caused by a lack of fish? Pollution? Sanitation issues? In recent years, the MAR has been facing a major challenge – an increase in macroalgae that threatens its coral reefs. These blooms grow on corals, prevent larval settlement, and compete for space. This is due to low herbivore populations and nutrient contamination from wastewater management and agricultural activities. To tackle this problem,  . The program is divided into two phases:  focuses on quantifying the human impacts derived from wastewater in priority sites where tourism has the most impact. Control sites that aren’t influenced by tourism-related fluctuations will also be included to provide quantitative data.   will expand the sampling sites to assess nutrient enrichment from other sources.  Five sampling locations have been identified in each of the three most tourism-affected MAR countries – Honduras, Belize, and Mexico. These will be divided into three locations impacted by tourism and two control locations. Water quality parameters will be sampled monthly to quantify any changes in water quality. This handbook was created for anyone who wants to get involved in water quality management.   We believe that a consistent approach to monitoring water quality can lead to more resilient reefs.

        "content": "When improperly treated sewage enters the marine environment, it can have devastating effects on a coral reef. Not only does it bring bacteria that can pose a threat to human health, but it also brings nutrients that fuel the growth of algae—a fierce competitor in the coral reef ecosystem. Algae compete with corals for space, and if not controlled, can quickly overtake a coral reef ecosystem. That’s why at CORAL we focus so heavily on making sure corals have the clean, clear water they need to thrive. And it’s why we’ve been partnering with the local community in West End, Roatán, Honduras since 2013 to help   to ensure the plant is operational and homes are connected to it. It’s working—together with our partners, we decreased the amount of bacteria in the nearshore waters of Half Moon Bay by more than 98 percent between 2013 and 2020. The water along the coast of western Roatán is once again healthy and clean. “The numbers are amazing,” said Dr. Antonella Rivera, CORAL’s Principal Investigator in Honduras. “There is a huge difference in the before and after. It’s hard to believe it can actually happen in such a short period of time, and it’s also very fulfilling and motivating for me to see. You think you’ll see a little bit of change, but not of that magnitude.” These impressive statistics are proof that partnering with communities and making long-term investments to improve local conditions can pay big dividends for coral reefs, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Water quality has improved so much that West End has been  , a third-party certification that recognizes safe, accessible and sustainable beaches. This is a huge success for the people who swim, play, and work in these waters—they now have clean water and don’t have to worry about getting sick. But these remarkable improvements are also helping coral reefs become healthier. Though further research is needed, our scientists believe there’s a link between water quality and coral disease, which stresses corals and can lead to bleaching. When sewage pollution decreased in Half Moon Bay, the prevalence of coral disease also decreased. From 2011 to 2016, coral disease dropped from 25 percent to zero in the region, leading our researchers to believe that the pathogens and nutrients in untreated wastewater are harmful to corals’ health. “Before we started monitoring in Half Moon Bay, the level of disease was very high,” Dr. Rivera said. “But we’ve monitored that with our partners, Healthy Reefs Initiative, every two years and, in 2016 and 2018, disease levels had gone down to zero. We can’t say that this is conclusively because of water quality improvements—disease can also happen because of other stressors such as climate change and other types of pollutants—but reducing the amount of sewage in the ocean likely contributes to making cleaner, healthier water for these coral reefs so they can be healthy and disease-free.” To address this, Dr. Rivera is leading efforts to expand water quality testing in the Mesoamerican region to give us a better understanding of sewage-related impacts on the coral reef ecosystem."

The 5-week class, Reef-Friendly Shoreline Innovations, is designed to teach watershed stewardship and landscape design principles to shoreline property owners in an effort to reduce threats to Maui’s coral reefs. According to an economic valuation study conducted in 2002, Hawaiian coral reefs contribute an average of $364 million annually to the Hawaiian economy. But coral reefs around the Main Hawaiian Islands are being threatened by poor water quality, much of which is caused by rainwater running off of the land and entering the marine environment, bringing with it pesticides, herbicides, nutrients, and sediment—all of which are harmful to reefs. “In this course we’ll talk a lot about Low Impact Design, which focuses on using plants and landscape designs to catch stormwater and prevent it from entering our oceans,” says Wes Crile, Hawai‘i field manager for CORAL and one of the course instructors. “The concepts are incredibly easy to implement, and can really help Maui’s reefs recover from a lot of the stress they’ve been under.” The new Reef-Friendly Shoreline Innovations course will cater to shoreline property owners, managers, landscapers, and residents interested in reef-friendly landscaping. The course will cover the fundamentals of Low Impact Design (LID), irrigation management, plant selection, visitor and community engagement, and more. Field trips to visit reef-friendly landscapes at various hotels are included. The class will take place on Thursday afternoons from 2:00-4:30pm, from April 23 to May 21, 2015. The course is $219, or $110 with an ETF discount. Tuition assistance may be available to eligible participants. CEUs will be available for those who need them. To learn more or register for this course, visit EdVentureMaui.com, or contact Melanie Stephens at  . This class is part of a larger CORAL project to partner with hotels and communities along the West Maui coastline to protect and restore Maui’s coral reefs. By reducing threats to reefs such as poor water quality and overfishing, CORAL strives to create a healthy environment in which coral reefs can adapt to changes and survive long into the future for generations to come.

        "content": "— Today, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) released a highly anticipated Preliminary Engineering Report that charts the path forward for protecting one of the most significant reefs in the main Hawaiian Islands. The report puts forth a formal recommendation for a new, community-wide sewage treatment facility. Over the years, Puakō residents noticed a decline in reef health and came together to protect their reef, enlisting researchers and local nonprofit organizations to assist in their efforts. In response, CORAL formed and facilitates the Clean Water for Reefs Puakō project and   to ensure a broad and collective voice among the community and local partners. The  , completed by AQUA Engineering, a respected firm that specializes in wastewater treatment, is a thorough analysis of three potential wastewater treatment solutions for the Puakō community, including Aerobic Treatment Units (ATUs), connection to the Kalahuipua’a Lagoons (Mauna Lani) facility, and a dedicated onsite treatment facility. “The onsite treatment facility will provide the best environmental results for the Puakō community and its reefs,” said Erica Perez, Hawai‘i program manager for CORAL, “It also has the highest treatment quality and the lowest 20-year life cycle cost, with 100 percent effluent reuse.” A key challenge for wastewater treatment in Puakō is the proximity of residential properties to the shoreline, combined with the geology—very porous volcanic rock and high groundwater. This means that any polluted water released from residential treatment units can make its way to the reefs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated the South Kohala region, including Puakō, as a Coral Priority Management Site through its Habitat Blueprint initiative. The Puakō reef is also recognized by The State Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) and the South Kohala Coastal Partnership as a priority area for ridge-to-reef management through the South Kohala Conservation Action Plan. Next steps for the project include securing necessary land and permits, determining management and ownership options, outlining funding avenues, and a developing a long-term monitoring plan and citizen science group.

CORAL partnered with   and   artists, Matt and Roxy Ortiz, to produce a mural that inspires environmental change. The mural also shows how Hawaiian residents can enjoy and protect the landscape of West Maui so that it provides clean water for the coral reefs that we’re working to save. PangeaSeed Foundation and teams of artists created eight murals in Wailuku, Maui, with the help of partners including CORAL, Maui County, SMALL TOWN * BIG ART, Lush Natural Cosmetics, Bow Seat Ocean Awareness Programs, Patagonia, Pacific Whale Foundation, Volcom Hawaii, Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii, the Johnson Ohana Foundation, Montana Cans and Behr Paint. CORAL advised Wooden Wave on the creation of the large-scale mural, located at 1760 Mill Street in Wailuku, Maui so that it conveyed a creative depiction of the midslope region where CORAL is ensuring clean water for coral reefs. CORAL’s Clean Water for Reefs initiative in Maui focuses on reducing land-based sources of pollution in the Wahikuli and Honokōwai watersheds, which were identified by researchers from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as the biggest sediment polluters in West Maui. CORAL is implementing innovative planting practices that reduce land-based sources of pollution like sediment and soil that gets washed downstream, where it settles on coral reefs and causes coral disease and death. Addressing land-based pollution not only helps corals stay healthy, but it also helps them be more resistant to the rising temperatures of climate change, and   recently found that coral reefs in West Hawaiʻi were stabilizing and poised to recover from the worst bleaching event in the state’s history four years ago. CORAL is ensuring clean water for reefs Maui and is identifying best practices of planting techniques so that these approaches can be used by international partners to provide clean water for coral reefs around the world.

        "content": "Monday, July 1, 2019 — A   released today in Nature Climate Change gives hope for coral reefs. The pioneering study launched by the Coral Reef Alliance is one of the first to demonstrate that management that takes evolution and adaptation into account can help rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change. Importantly, the results show that by making smart decisions to protect reefs today, conservation managers can generate the conditions that can help corals adapt to rising temperatures. “It is well documented that climate change is causing corals to die off at an unprecedented rate, but our study provides tools that offer promise for their survival,” stated Dr. Madhavi Colton, co-author and Program Director at the Coral Reef Alliance. “Our results show that when evolution is enabled, conservation efforts can help corals adapt to rising temperatures.” Contrary to approaches that are popular today, such as focusing protection on reefs in cooler water, the study shows that protecting diverse reef habitat types across a spectrum of ocean conditions is key to helping corals adapt to climate change. “We found that a diversity of reef types provides the variety that evolution depends on,” explained co-author Malin Pinsky, Associate-Professor at Rutgers University. “Hot sites are important sources of heat-tolerant corals, while cold sites and those in between can become important future habitats. Together, a diversity of reef types act as stepping stones that give corals the best chance for adapting and moving as climate changes.” Key to successful evolution is management that improves local conditions for reefs by effectively reducing local stressors, such as overfishing and water pollution. However, the authors caution that not all management strategies are created equal. “We used mathematical models to test the effects of management choices on coral reef outlooks,” stated Dr. Tim Walsworth, lead author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington. “We found that corals in well-managed areas act a source of baby corals in the future, essentially rescuing reefs after the climate stabilizes. Without both evolution and management, the corals in our model were unable to survive rising temperatures.” Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and support the livelihoods of over 500 million people. Globally, they are estimated to be worth US$375 billion per year. The study shows that managing reefs to facilitate evolution today and in the future can enhance their prospects for long-term survival. This means creating managed area networks that contain a diversity of coral types and habitats and that effectively reduce local stressors. “This study shows that we know enough of the science to act—and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste,” says Dr. Colton. The study titled,   is the result of a collaborative research program launched by Dr. Madhavi Colton and Dr. Michael Webster of the Coral Reef Alliance. Our partners include Dr. Timothy Walsworth, Professor Daniel Schindler and Professor Tim Essington at the University of Washington, and Associate Professor Malin Pinsky at Rutgers University.

        "content": "Thursday, October 1, 2020 10-year-old Abby Rogers has converted her backyard into a native plant nursery to help save coral reefs. Rogers is a volunteer with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), helping to grow native plants that will be transplanted at their stream restoration site in Wahikuli. The native plants trap sediment that runs off the slope and into the ocean where it smothers coral reefs. Typically, CORAL purchases the plants and hosts volunteer planting days at the stream restoration site. But when COVID-19 restrictions hit and the group planting days were no longer safe, the team put a call out to volunteers to grow the plants at home from seed. “I really wanted to do things for the environment, but had not found a way to really help besides not using a straw or bringing my own bags to the store,” says Rogers. “My mom read about [the CORAL project] in a newspaper article and suggested it to me.” Originally, Rogers signed up to take home three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But once she realized how much fun it was, she signed up for 15 more kits. That brings her total to 900 native plants. Rogers has certainly taken the plunge into her first-ever volunteer project. “I have always been interested in the environment because I have always wanted to help the world,” says the 5 th grader. “I spent seven years in China, where I learned firsthand about air and water pollution. Now, living in Hawai‘i, I have been looking for ways I can make a positive impact on the environment.” Rogers is one of 100 volunteers who signed up to grow 25,000 seeds for CORAL. Since not all seeds tend to germinate, CORAL estimates that about 10,000 plants will ultimately be transplanted. “She’s our most prolific volunteer,” says Larissa Treese, CORAL’s Program Coordinator on Maui and the coordinator behind the at-home plant growing volunteer program. “It’s so great seeing the next generation stepping up to save coral reefs—the amount of sediment we’ll be able to trap with the plants she’s growing will definitely have an impact.” Once a volunteer signs up to participate, CORAL provides them with the seeds and instructions on how to grow them. Volunteers can choose whether to donate the rest of the supplies (soil, trays and pots) or whether to borrow them from CORAL. Once the plants are fully grown, the volunteer can return them to CORAL to be transplanted or they can visit the restoration site and transplant them themselves. CORAL has been engaged in slope restoration in West Maui for several years, using native plants and trees to restore Maui’s once lush forests and reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. The key to CORAL’s success is building strong local partnerships. The restoration project in Wahikuli is a testament to that, bringing together partners like Maui Nui Botanical Gardens, West Maui Ridge 2 Reef and Down the Hatch. “The at-home native plant kits have been a terrific way to bring the community together and keep our volunteers engaged, since we can’t meet in person anymore,” says Treese. “It’s also helped us save the money that we would typically spend on purchasing the fully grown plants.” To sign up to volunteer and receive your own at-home native planting kit, email Larissa Treese at ltreese@coral.org. This project is funded by Hawai‘i Tourism Authority and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) is a nonprofit focused on saving the world’s coral reefs. At the local level, CORAL partners with communities in Hawai‘i and Honduras to design lasting conservation programs that protect both the coral reefs and the communities that depend upon them.

        "content": "September 9, 2014   Nyoman Sugiarta, a fisherman from Bali, has been selected by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) as the inaugural 2014 CORAL Conservation Prize winner. Sugiarta will receive $20,000 for his leadership and dedication protecting coral reefs, and will travel to the United States later this month to collect his prize. “The CORAL Conservation Prize celebrates some of the most remarkable coral reef conservation leaders and provides them with necessary resources to continue their important work,” says CORAL’s Executive Director Michael Webster. “We’re excited to have Nyoman as the inaugural winner, and hope his successful conservation program can offer guidance and inspiration to other leaders around the world.” Sugiarta was chosen for his work protecting and monitoring coral reefs off the coast of Bondalem, Bali. With the support of Reef Check Indonesia, Sugiarta and his team have built a strong network of support for reef protection and have created a marine protected area (MPA). “At first, I didn’t know much about coral reefs and didn’t know why Reef Check Indonesia was coming to my village. They kept trying to tell us corals were important for the fish and for providing protection against waves,” says Sugiarta. “But now I understand what corals are, and how important they are.” Sugiarta volunteers his time monitoring reefs with Reef Check Indonesia, and is the leader of the MPA’s citizen enforcement team. He and his team have set up a successful monitoring program for their MPA, and patrol the beach regularly. They also conduct regular underwater cleanups. Sugiarta is dedicated to supporting fishermen, and encourages more sustainable fishing practices. “The reef looks much better now than it did before we created the MPA because we stopped fisherman from neighboring villages from using cyanide poison on the reef,” says Sugiarta. “We also stopped fishermen from using bottom nets, which, as far as I know, damage the reef and the environment permanently.” The area currently has two fish aggravating devices (FADs), designed to decrease the local fishing pressure on reef fish. The FADs, built by Sugiarta and his team, attract pelagic fish; research has found them to be very successful in providing more fishing opportunities for fishermen, while simultaneously taking pressure off near-shore reef fish populations. Sugiarta has big plans to put his prize money back into his program. “I want to buy mooring buoys to mark the MPA boundaries, and I want to buy a patrol boat complete with an outboard machine. I also want to develop a program for elementary schools to be able to come to the area and learn about conservation.” Additionally, he hopes to use part of his new funds to build four more FADs and continue supporting the Bondalem fishing community. CORAL will present Sugiarta with his award on September 20, 2014 at the CORAL 20  Anniversary Gala at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. It will be Sugiarta’s first trip to the United States, and he couldn’t be more excited. “I can’t sleep at night because I know I’m coming to the big country,” says Sugiarta. “I still feel like I’m dreaming.” To learn more about Sugiarta and the CORAL 20  Anniversary Gala, visit  .   The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) unites communities to save coral reefs.

Ecotourists have higher incomes than regular tourists on average, and they tend to spend more money while traveling. Attracting this growing market could help hotels increase their bottom line. Over $24 billion was spent in 2005 on ecotourism—and in a 2007 study by the Center for Responsible Travel, 54 percent of respondents said they would be more likely to patronize hotels and resorts that were environmentally responsible. Today’s tourists are seeking genuine natural experiences, and they’re becoming more aware and discerning of false environmental advertising, or greenwashing. Additionally, healthy reefs and clean water are essential to maintaining Hawai‘i’s allure as a destination—80 percent of Hawai‘i’s nearly 8 million annual visitors engage in marine-related recreational activities during their stay. The new Hawai‘i Hotel Reef Stewardship Guide is designed to help hotels adopt practices that protect coral reefs and attract this growing number of tourists interested in supporting environmentally-friendly businesses.

        "content": "Thanks to David Welder for asking about the difference between parrotfish and wrasses; he thought the image on the coin looked remarkably like a Maori wrasse ( ) and was curious about how they are related to the humphead parrotfish. Turns out it looked like a Maori wrasse because it is one! We obviously did not examine the mouth on the fish closely enough. These wrasses have large, succulent lips, not the toothier grins of the reef-grinding parrotfish.   Maori wrasse is a common name for several different species of wrasse.   (the Fijian species on the coin) is also confusingly known as the Napoleon wrasse, humphead wrasse, Napoleon fish, and Napoleonfish.  Wrasses belong to the family Labridae, and the Maori wrasse is the largest living member of the family. Males can be as long as six feet, and females about three feet. Males change color, from electric blue to pale green, blue-green, or purplish blue; females and juveniles are red-orange above and red-orange to white below. Although wrasses are long-lived, they are slow breeders, and their numbers have declined due to intensive fishing pressures, collection for aquariums, and habitat destruction and degradation, among other problems.   Though long been considered a different family, because of genetic similarities many scientists now regard parrotfish as a subfamily of Labridae.   Here is a selection of some of the other questions we received—and answers from CORAL’s experts.   The answer to this question is more complicated than you might think! It depends on the species of parrotfish—and how big they are. Scientists estimate that one stoplight parrotfish can process and generate about 0.6 pounds of sand per day on average.   Some species of parrotfish produce mucus from glands behind their gills, secrete it from their mouths, and then spread it over their bodies and heads, creating a sleeping bag or cocoon that protects them from tiny blood-sucking shrimp-like parasites at night—similar to people using mosquito nets. Sleeping fish are particularly vulnerable to parasites at night when cleaner fish and shrimp are off the clock. Studies show that when the fish are not protected by their mucus cocoons, their parasite loads increase by about nine-fold. And if a predator like a moray eel nudges the protective membrane of the cocoon, parrotfish can feel this vibration and flee. Parrotfish spend about 2.5 percent of their daily energy budget to create their nighttime protection systems.         Of course! Most of our projects are located in areas where tourism represents a significant part of the local economy, so you can definitely visit them. We have been working longest with the Kubulau community in Fiji, where the nearby Namena Marine Reserve shows high fish biomass and diversity compared to sites nearby that don’t enjoy the same level of protection. Trips to Namena can be arranged from resorts in Savusavu or enjoyed from live-aboards in the area. Another great option is the West End of Roatan, Honduras, where—thanks in part to our work with the Roatan Marine Park—fish populations are rebounding. For a special treat, arrange a trip to Cordelia Banks—the coral cover will blow your mind."

        "content": "The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), our partners in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and the people of Roatán celebrated a major win as a decade of work recently came to fruition when the island passed clean water standards for the first time since monitoring began in 2013. The island of Roatán, part of the Bay Islands of Honduras, is world-renowned for its colorful reefs, white sand beaches, and clear waters. Over a million tourists visit this small island each year, contributing over 1 billion US dollars to the Honduran economy. About a decade ago, CORAL and partners realized that polluted ocean water in Roatán was beginning to threaten coral reef health and human health — and with it, the tourism industry and local economy. CORAL began working with the communities of West End and Half Moon Bay on Roatán, where – due to a lack of funding and few alternatives – the majority of homes and businesses were discharging their wastewater directly into the environment, resulting in unsafe levels of fecal bacteria along the coast. CORAL and partners stepped in to help resolve chronic ocean pollution problems resulting from wastewater by conducting water quality monitoring, building the capacity of local organizations to manage water resources, and connecting nearly 300 homes and businesses to a nearby wastewater treatment facility. [Best_Wordpress_Gallery id=”23″ gal_title=”Wastewater Treatment in Roatán”] Today, the water in Roatán is now passing clean water standards, with a 95% reduction in fecal bacteria since our water quality monitoring began in 2013. The amount of raw sewage discharged into the coastal environment has been reduced by nearly 30 million gallons per year. Ninety-seven percent of the homes and businesses that can be connected to a water treatment facility are connected. As a result of providing clean water, the most recent coral health survey showed a dramatic drop in coral disease from 25% in 2011 to zero in 2018. CORAL proudly celebrated the declaration of West End as a Blue Flag beach last year. Blue Flag certification comes from a third party that validates marine water quality, freshwater availability, and garbage disposal practices. This is a remarkable achievement, as West End previously did not pass safe swimming standards. Our success in Roatán is a rallying cry for others across the Bay Islands and Honduras to tackle this issue, and we are seeing results as government entities, local communities, and the private sector are increasing their commitment to addressing wastewater issues. We’re continuing to work closely with these stakeholders to improve local conditions and provide clean water for coral reefs in the region. Efforts like these are creating the local conditions that allow healthy corals to thrive, and because this work is part of a network, these reefs contribute to adaptation and repopulation of corals across the entire Mesoamerican Reef system. We will continue to support our local partners in their efforts to reduce local stressors so that corals can adapt to the effects of climate change and continue to support the people of the Mesoamerican Region."

        "content": "When improperly treated sewage enters the marine environment, it can have devastating effects on a coral reef. Not only does it bring bacteria that can pose a threat to human health, but it also brings nutrients that fuel the growth of algae—a fierce competitor in the coral reef ecosystem. Algae compete with corals for space, and if not controlled, can quickly overtake a coral reef ecosystem. That’s why at CORAL we focus so heavily on making sure corals have the clean, clear water they need to thrive. And it’s why we’ve been partnering with the local community in West End, Roatán, Honduras since 2013 to help   to ensure the plant is operational and homes are connected to it. It’s working—together with our partners, we decreased the amount of bacteria in the nearshore waters of Half Moon Bay by more than 98 percent between 2013 and 2020. The water along the coast of western Roatán is once again healthy and clean. “The numbers are amazing,” said Dr. Antonella Rivera, CORAL’s Principal Investigator in Honduras. “There is a huge difference in the before and after. It’s hard to believe it can actually happen in such a short period of time, and it’s also very fulfilling and motivating for me to see. You think you’ll see a little bit of change, but not of that magnitude.” These impressive statistics are proof that partnering with communities and making long-term investments to improve local conditions can pay big dividends for coral reefs, which are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Water quality has improved so much that West End has been  , a third-party certification that recognizes safe, accessible and sustainable beaches. This is a huge success for the people who swim, play, and work in these waters—they now have clean water and don’t have to worry about getting sick. But these remarkable improvements are also helping coral reefs become healthier. Though further research is needed, our scientists believe there’s a link between water quality and coral disease, which stresses corals and can lead to bleaching. When sewage pollution decreased in Half Moon Bay, the prevalence of coral disease also decreased. From 2011 to 2016, coral disease dropped from 25 percent to zero in the region, leading our researchers to believe that the pathogens and nutrients in untreated wastewater are harmful to corals’ health. “Before we started monitoring in Half Moon Bay, the level of disease was very high,” Dr. Rivera said. “But we’ve monitored that with our partners, Healthy Reefs Initiative, every two years and, in 2016 and 2018, disease levels had gone down to zero. We can’t say that this is conclusively because of water quality improvements—disease can also happen because of other stressors such as climate change and other types of pollutants—but reducing the amount of sewage in the ocean likely contributes to making cleaner, healthier water for these coral reefs so they can be healthy and disease-free.” To address this, Dr. Rivera is leading efforts to expand water quality testing in the Mesoamerican region to give us a better understanding of sewage-related impacts on the coral reef ecosystem."

        "content": "The social sciences have historically been more intertwined with terrestrial conservation than with their marine counterpart. The notion of incorporating social science into conservation efforts began with the concept of Integrated Conservation and Development Programs (ICDPs), which aimed to simultaneously meet development and conservation goals. While the results of these projects were mixed, it remains a commonly used concept, carried out under the more commonly known term of  “community-based natural resource management” or “community-based conservation.” Through these programs, conservation groups, particularly in the developing world, are increasingly incorporating social needs into their strategies. Socially integrative concepts like co-management, Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFs), and Rapid Assessment techniques are now more prevalent in coral reef conservation as well. All of these structures and tools incorporate social science principles. Today it seems that taking human needs and desires into account is recognized as being irrevocably linked to conservation, yet community members are still sometimes brought in as an afterthought. Pursuing conservation is inherently a social endeavor, which means that taking humans into account as part of the ecosystem is invaluable to our work as conservationists. As our field staff around the world can attest, entering a community with preconceived ideas and plans doesn’t always work out. Particularly when dealing with marine conservation and a local community that depends on the resources of the sea, our approach must be open and humble. As referenced in a recent paper by Hicks et al.,  “human values need to be considered in all decision-making”–and these values and priorities can differ greatly. CORAL has found that entering a community with an active ear, ready to work with all stakeholders to find common ground, is the best approach. When working with different cultures it is easy to project our own perceptions onto a situation. Instead, the community’s interpretations, perceptions, and desires must be expressed, understood, and incorporated from the beginning. CORAL adopts these lessons from social science and employs them in our approach. This framework for engagement can be seen in our programs in Fiji, Honduras, and Indonesia. In these countries, we have worked alongside and in collaboration with local communities, ensuring that their concerns and needs receive priority. In Fiji, we consulted with community members and local stakeholders numerous times in designing a user fee system that respected their goals and authorities. The result was a broadly accepted program that achieved high local compliance. Conservation success can never be achieved without the compliance and support of human beings. Conducting socioeconomic studies and engaging the community prior to coming to conclusions regarding problems and solutions ensures that the actual and perceived issues are addressed, with collaboration and buy-in from all.

After his teacher decided to hold a Tzedakah (in Hebrew, “doing a good deed”) and parents created a fund to benefit nonprofit organizations, the 30 students in Gavin’s grade researched a variety of potential beneficiaries, then gave presentations about them. The students gave each of the nonprofits a donation, but chose three favorites to receive the largest awards. Gavin’s choice, CORAL, came in third, and on January 23, he presented CORAL’s Executive Director, Dr. Michael Webster, with a check for $725. Gavin says he “thought CORAL looked the best” of the coral reef conservation organizations he researched. In his five-page essay assignment, he writes, “People are not doing much about the dying coral reefs, but the Coral Reef Alliance is working to end this… Do you want your children, or your children’s children to see the beautiful coral reefs, or do you want it to be a story, something you wouldn’t be able to go and see? You and I might not be able to witness a change in our lives, but if we act strongly and carefully, there might be a future for the coral reefs.” Gavin says he is motivated by his love for all animals-from his two cats to the tiny fish and other creatures that live on coral reefs. He was taught since pre-kindergarten that “everything counts” and needs to be treated with respect. After seeing a documentary at the California Academy of Sciences about coral reefs, he realized that “we have only a certain amount of time to save them. I learned that lots of animals’ lives depend on the reef … The future of coral reefs around the world is in our own hands.”"

The environment is a job for everybody; we need to stop blaming and judging each other and work together.” Nan is walking that talk in Indonesia-and she’s having a lot of success. In 2013, after years of advocacy, CORAL, Conservation International, and The Nature Conservancy persuaded the Raja Ampat government to sign a shark and manta ray sanctuary (that had been declared in 2010) into law. The law protects sharks and rays in 46,000 square kilometers (18,000 square miles) of ocean off the coast of Raja Ampat. And for the past three years, CORAL’s Indonesian field team has been gathering community input—from fishermen, business operators, and government officials—on plans for a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) off the coast of Bali. Born in Bandung, West Java, Nan has been a field manager for CORAL since 2009. She always loved nature, spending lots of time in “mud, a river, and a little forest” near her home. In college, biology was one of her easiest subjects. But it was her father’s observation—that Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world with 17,500 islands but limited human resources to manage them—that nudged her in the direction of coral reefs and marine biology. After finishing postgraduate work at Bandung Institute of Technology and the School of Environmental Science at the University of East Anglia in the UK, Nan worked for the World Wildlife Fund and Reef Check Foundation, two organizations with which she continues to work closely. She finds that CORAL’s smaller size gives her more of an opportunity to build trust with local communities. Her effectiveness is grounded in her sense of urgency. “We are borrowing time. The need to manage our resources more effectively is escalating,” says Nan. “The only way to do that is for the locals to be the main actors in initiating, developing, implementing, and maintaining conservation systems. To be able to facilitate and empower them to do so is very satisfying.”"

With representatives from 11 countries in the Pacific and over 60 participants and observers, significant progress was made toward ensuring these newly listed species–oceanic whitetip, scalloped hammerhead, great hammerhead, smooth hammerhead, the porbeagle shark, and two species of manta rays–achieve the protection they desperately need. The workshop kicked off in traditional Fijian fashion with an opening welcome from Mr. Samuela Namosimaluaa, Permanent Secretary for Local Government, Urban Development, Housing and Environment, as well as with a video message from the CITES Secretary General Mr. John Scanlon. The panel included Imogen Zethoven, Director of Global Shark Conservation for The Pew Charitable Trusts acting as Chair of the meeting; Mr. Aisake Batibasaga, Principal Fisheries Officer for Fiji; Colin Simfendorfer Director of the IUCN Shark Specialist Group; Shaneen Coulson, CITES Scientific Authority of Australia; and Hugh Robertson, CITES Scientific Authority of New Zealand. Speakers also included Stan Shea—an expert in the shark fin trade in Hong Kong, Ian Freeman from the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), and Lindsay Chapman from Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). All of these speakers assisted in familiarizing participants with the context of these new listings and on the details of how to ensure they are implemented properly. But one presentation stole the show (and the fresh air from the room). Dr. Demian Chapman, aka the ‘”fin Doctor,” as he was aptly nicknamed after his demonstration, ensured that all attendees were familiar with how to identify the fins of these species. His hands-on approach involved displaying dried fins on all of the tables around the room, providing a very fragrant and visual reference. Overall, the two-day workshop was filled with thoughtful questions and productive strategic planning. But most importantly, this meeting gave all of the CITES parties in the region the opportunity to convene and discuss what needs to be done regionally in order for the new listings to be effective. Some key conclusions that spanned the region were: These conclusions will ideally translate into action on the ground, including a plan to address gaps in data, as well as a strategy for enforcement to be put in place prior to the September 14, 2014 implementation date. CORAL looks forward to working with our partners in Fiji to ensure that the government is equipped and prepared to make the most of these landmark listings—which have the potential to significantly reduce shark mortality not only in the Pacific but around the world."

Close to 800 elkhorn corals ( ), listed as critically endangered on the IUCN’s Red List and threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, live in the Bay while the Capiro Banks reef has almost four times more live coral cover than most reefs in the region. When the area was first surveyed and described in 2011, the partnership also measured an uncommonly high density of the long-spined sea urchin, which has seriously declined throughout the Caribbean, on the reef. The designation came about through extensive collaboration and partnerships, work that was generously supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Oak Foundation. “The Mayor of Tela has shown a tremendous amount of leadership in this effort, supported by CORAL and the other groups on the ground,” said Jason Babbie, who works on environment programs at Bloomberg Philanthropies. “I am impressed by how quickly this designation came together for this ecologically important site.”  ###"

At age 13, Dylan founded his own nonprofit called ReefQuest to foster marine stewardship through citizen science. But the idea for ReefQuest—and his first “initiative,” as he puts it—began when he was only seven. Visiting Kahekili Beach Park in Maui with his family, he saw tourists stepping on coral reefs and then complaining that the coral was hurting their feet. Dylan began walking up and down the beach, doing regular “beach patrols,” explaining to his fellow beachgoers that the reef was alive—and that in fact, it was people who were hurting the reef by stepping on it. Their reactions, he says, were varied, but most were appreciative and inspired by a kid wanting to save reefs for future generations. “I made an emotional connection with them,” he says. CORAL awarded ReefQuest its first mini-grant, and has worked with Dylan since 2010. In March, CORAL Field Manager Liz Foote dived the reef with Dylan in Kahekili to take a series of overlapping underwater images, which will be “stitched together” as part of ReefQuest’s “virtual reef.” The virtual reef project is a way for people who can’t—or don’t want to—get wet by taking a “virtual dive” to experience the reef. But it’s also a way to monitor the health of a reef over time, says Dylan. He will be returning to the reef every other year to study it. Dylan plans to continue his life’s work throughout high school, and beyond. One of the most important things he’s learned so far is that people “assume that kids can’t do anything”—but he’s found just the opposite. “I am making a difference—kids really can do something. People say we can’t stop global warming, but there are local threats that are equally as destructive. We can change those things for the better and help these silent ecosystems.”"

        "content": "On the north shore of Kauai, just north of the well known Hanalei Bay, is an idylic stretch of coastline known as “Makua.” Makua, a Hawaiian word for provider, may refer in this case to the important resources that came from this once vibrant reef ecosystem and helped provide for the needs of people living in the region for many generations. The reef continues to be used by the local community and visitors to Kauai for subsistance fishing, gathering of “wana” or sea urchin, cultural practices, snorkeling, surfing, and swimming. But today the reef’s ability to continue to sustainably provide is being challenged. Fish numbers are declining, and a coral disease has recently been documented in the region. To help inform possible solutions, CORAL is teaming up with the Hanalei Watershed Hui (HWH) to gather data on water quality that might yield clues as to the causes of these symptoms. “Despite the importance of the area, very little has been done to examine the water quality of Makua,”says Makaala Kaaumoana, Executive Director of HWH. She and her team will be working with CORAL and local volunteers over the next year to conduct periodic sampling and to analyze data from several sites along the Makua coastline. “The data will be collected by trained area residents, analyzed, and shared with the community as well as government agencies and scientists, so it really is a grassroots, community-led endeavor,” says Makaala. Says CORAL’s Hawai‘i Field Manager Wes Crile (profiled  ), “Once we know what the causes of the declines are, we’ll know where to direct our efforts.” He adds that the Hanalei Watershed Hui is a perfect match and a strong partner for CORAL. “Both CORAL and HWH have at their core the principle of working with communities to solve these complex problems, and HWH has very close ties with the local people.” The reef at Makua has provided for people for so long it is only fitting that people now do something to help the reef, says Wes. He hopes this program will be the first step in that direction.  Read more about CORAL’s water quality work in Hawai‘i  ."

        "content": "Wes Crile thinks it takes a watershed to save a reef. Sound daunting? Not to him—he views it as a great opportunity. Since joining CORAL as a Hawai‘i field manager in January, he has been busy getting to know his new watershed in Maui. Because Maui is an island, he says, some of its water quality problems are more obvious than in a watershed like Chesapeake Bay, where he worked previously. “On Maui, a simple trip to the store can easily take me through 10 to 15 separate watersheds. You can really see the direct impacts (both positive and negative) that our actions on the land are having on the sea and the reefs.” In addition to restoring streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Wes has worked with communities in northern Nicaragua to protect endangered sea turtles and build sustainable tourism partnerships, with small-scale farmers in West Africa and Haiti, and fishing communities in Latin America and the Caribbean, among others. He is building on those experiences at CORAL. “Whether I’m engaging with farmers, neighborhood associations, or marine tourism providers, I’m getting a chance to work across all of my skills,” he says. A certified dive master and licensed Coast Guard caption, Wes is getting his feet (and body) wet in Ridge to Reef activities, engaging with a variety of groups throughout the watershed. He’s working with fellow Field Manager Liz Foote to set up a floating workshop for decision makers (scheduled for this summer) and helping conduct snorkel tours for local government officials and other stakeholders to show them firsthand the difference between healthy and unhealthy reefs. His favorite part of the job—as it was in his previous work—is collaborating to find solutions to problems. “A scientist tells me we need to reduce polluted runoff, but what I get excited about is how to do that,” he says. “I like finding creative solutions to issues and working with business owners, community members, and others to find solutions that make sense for both the environment and the needs of people. I like explaining sustainability to a general manager at a hotel or resort and really seeing him or her get it.” Although as an avid diver he loves coral reefs, Wes says he’s motivated more by water—where it goes and how clean it is. “It’s what ties the whole community together. It falls on a mountain, flows through different land uses, like agriculture, forests, people’s backyards: As it exits into the ocean, does it leave in a better or worse state? Can we get it to leave in a better state? So many coral reef issues start farther upstream.” He says some solutions to addressing polluted runoff and poor water quality downstream are very simple. “Solutions don’t have to be complicated and expensive or high tech. They can be implemented on a small scale but make a big difference. The rain gardens and other low-impact development options we and our partners at the Ridge to Reef Initiative are working to educate people about are one example.” Read more about Wes  ."

        "content": "On a beautiful and uncharacteristically calm afternoon in February, Maui County’s Mayor, Alan Arakawa, arrived at Kahekili Beach Park, barefoot and carrying a mask and fins in a bucket. Mayor Arakawa was eager to get in the water to dive with CORAL and our partners from the   and the   (“DAR”) to check out the reef. We had invited the Mayor and Rob Parsons, Executive Assistant for Environmental Concerns, to join us to visit priority watershed conservation sites in West Maui—primarily the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (“KHFMA”), designated by the US Coral Reef Task Force as a top priority. We wanted to see the reef firsthand and talk about solutions to the many interconnected threats facing our reefs. As it turns out, our mayor is an avid waterman. He told us that he has dived reefs all over Maui throughout his life, but hadn’t been out diving in over a year and a half. We were thrilled to provide him with the opportunity to get in the water again. But first we wanted to give him a brief overview of our collaborative efforts. I described CORAL’s work with resorts to promote reef stewardship and improve water quality, and the purpose of these snorkel tours (we’ll have more soon—stay tuned!), and our collaborative efforts with DAR, the Ridge to Reef Initiative, and the   program, which we co-coordinate with DAR. Tova Callender from the Ridge to Reef Initiative described the Initiative’s efforts to reduce land-based pollution by installing rain gardens and curb-inlet baskets, which capture and help filter urban pollutants and debris that find their way into storm drains, and ultimately the ocean. The mayor helped troubleshoot some issues with the curb-inlet baskets. We were encouraged by his eagerness to offer expertise and solutions, and his advocacy for ahupua‘a-based (watershed-based) management and conservation strategies. Darla White, from DAR, discussed fisheries management strategies in West Maui, particularly the establishment and importance of the KHFMA. She also introduced the concept of reef resilience, then gave an overview of what to expect on the snorkel tour. And last but not least, our volunteer team from Ka’anapali Makai Watch talked about their experiences and observations within the KHFMA and their ongoing efforts to help get the word out to residents and visitors about this special place. In the water, both the mayor and Rob displayed impressive skills as freedivers, and we were able to look closely at the “points of interest” Darla had discussed  earlier. She pointed to things underwater and then we all surfaced to hear her describe them in more detail. She showed us several “dead zones,” where once-thriving finger coral is now a collection of low-lying brown rubble; we also made our way to the “bone yard,” where we could still see the three-dimensional structure of coral that had died recently—a haunting and sad reminder of the reef that once thrived there.   We also visited and swam through submarine seeps in shallow water just offshore that were visibly emitting fresh water (which researchers have determined consists primarily of treated wastewater effluent) as well as gas bubbles (determined to be nitrogen gas). While much of the tour highlighted stressed and degraded coral–and the reasons for that condition–we also saw relatively healthy coral colonies, a honu (green sea turtle), and positive signs of potential recovery, including some adult   and a grazing school of about 100 surgeonfishes. After the reef tour, we convened back at the pavilion to enjoy some refreshments, at which time the mayor and Rob took the   to share their commitment to take action to reduce land-based pollution on an individual basis; we posted their pledges   immediately. To wrap up the day, we headed over to check out the demonstration rain garden at Wahikuli Wayside Park only to find that our newly installed interpretive sign had been vandalized with graffiti. Mayor Arakawa grabbed a towel from his vehicle and cleaned the sign off, while Tova discussed rain gardens as a “BMP” (Best Management Practice) for reducing land-based pollution. Rain gardens use native plants to filter stormwater on its path to the ocean. The trip was a great experience and opportunity for our team, and we appreciate the support of all the people who made it happen. We especially thank the mayor for taking so much time out of his busy schedule to join us. Snorkel gear for the trip was provided by  , and the   helped provide refreshments for the event from CJ’s Deli & Diner—delicious! Mahalo to these local businesses for their support!"

        "content": "Scientific research has great potential to inform conservation efforts. All too often, however, scientific results that could be useful languish on library shelves (or get lost in the cloud) instead. Some researchers make concerted efforts to address real-world questions, but these attempts frequently fail because the researchers do not fully understand what kind of information will be most useful to managers and conservation professionals. If on-the-ground practitioners are consulted, it’s usually at the end of a project when they are asked how they will use a new tool or newly revealed information, at which point the opportunity to guide development of the new tool or the type of information collected has long passed. The Reefs Tomorrow Initiative  (RTI) has taken a different approach to ensure that our research results address the most pressing needs of managers and conservation professionals. Parallel to our scientific pursuits, one of RTI’s core goals is to provide practical information managers and conservation practitioners can use to inform real-world management decisions. In the first year of the program, RTI’s conservation team—lead by Dr. Eleanor Sterling from the Center for Biodiversity & Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History—compiled information on how reef managers perceive threats to and changes on their reefs, as well as what kinds of management opportunities they have. The team collected data through an on-line survey and interviews with over 80 conservation practitioners from around the world. The majority of respondents reported frequent threats at local levels (like overfishing) and global scales (such as bleaching from warming waters), and little recovery. They reported some activities being addressed by local management efforts (fishing, land-use practices), while others at provincial or national levels (coastal development, tourism). While the data from these surveys and interviews is still being analyzed, the early results have been shared with RTI’s science team and will be used to guide our research efforts. By better understanding what kinds of information, and in what form, are most helpful to managers in making decisions, we are able to maximize the chance that our research results will be useful and useable. To further these efforts, we recently identified a cadre of managers from the Pacific who will be working closely with RTI over the coming year. Hailing from Palau, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji, these on-the-ground practitioners have attended workshops and joined in meetings with RTI’s scientists. In their role as conservation advisors, they will help us focus on the research that will be most applicable to the challenges they face. By taking a different approach to making science relevant, RTI is making sure that our science leads to real conservation gains.  "

Since most of our project sites are located on islands, we thought we’d celebrate this holiday with a deeper dive into what makes life on these places so interesting. Isolated from their mainland counterparts, island plants and animals evolve independently. Since no genetic mixing occurs with populations in other places, new species unique to the island form over time. This high rate of speciation, or creation of new species, makes islands important drivers of biodiversity. Islands have higher concentrations of endemic species (animals and plants found nowhere else) than continents, and the proportion of endemics increases with an island’s degree of isolation, size, and topographical diversity (which leads to different habitats). Why is biodiversity important? Madhavi Colton, CORAL’s program director for the Reefs Tomorrow Initiative, says biodiversity makes ecosystems more stable. She offers the example of coral reefs in the Caribbean, which used to have many different species of herbivorous fishes. “Overfishing reduced the abundance and diversity of herbivorous fishes leaving urchins as the only species keeping algae in check,” she explains. “When a disease wiped out the urchins, there were no more herbivores left to take their place and algae overgrew the reefs.” When there is a dip in the abundance of a key type of animal in a diverse ecosystem, the consequences will be “less dire because there are other species that play similar roles to pick up the slack,” says Madhavi.

He wrote about his experience: “It didn’t take long into our first dive before [we] started smiling—reefs that had been covered in algae five years ago were recovering. The big fish—snappers, groupers, and barracuda, and morays—were still there, but the smaller fish and little critters (shrimp, nudibranches, etc.) were there in much larger numbers than before, and the hard corals showed ample new growth.” After reading about CORAL’s work in Honduras in our 2013 annual report, Don emailed us to say that he was pleasantly surprised by the condition of the reefs on his 2013 visit—and wondered if CORAL had a hand in making those changes. We’re delighted to say yes. CORAL has been involved in Roatan since 2005, strengthening local groups and building alliances, and working from many different angles to solve environmental problems affecting Honduras’s reefs. This work has included helping the Roatan Marine Park improve their patrols, increase their technical capabilities, and build their financial stability.  CORAL also partners with the Healthy Reefs Initiative to monitor the reefs all around the north coast and Bay Islands. Says Honduras Field Manager Jenny Myton, “The areas where Don was diving have been monitored since 2006 and we have been able to document their improvement. The patrols have been working! The fish are coming back! This is important as some of these fish, especially the parrotfish, control the macroalgae that grow on the reef.” CORAL is also working with the government and local partners to improve regulation of development and to find solutions to the wastewater problems affecting the reef.

Indonesia recently declared three million square kilometers of its seas as a manta sanctuary. “The key for managing highly migratory species is to assure that we protect them not only in [specific] sites, but also along their migratory routes,” says Nan. She adds that to truly protect biodiversity, we also need to protect connections between islands—including coral reefs—to make sure corals can regenerate and replenish themselves after events like mass bleachings. Agus Darmawan, Director of Conservation for Areas and Fish Species at the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, points out that along with protecting mantas comes the responsibility of helping communities whose livelihoods are impacted by conservation regulations. CORAL and our partners are collaborating with national and local governments to help socialize new CITES regulations that regulate trade of some species of mantas and sharks. We have begun working with the community in Lamakera village, arguably the biggest artisanal manta fishery in the world. Over the years, residents there have seen their catch decline dramatically and have become more willing to support new regulations.  The community, CORAL, and our partners are creating a plan for developing alternative livelihoods that would benefit both the community and the environment."

Participants—a “who’s who” from within area government, hotel management, and other sectors critical to Hawai‘i’s future—donned their snorkel gear to explore both healthy and stressed reefs at Olowalu and within the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (KHFMA), and learned how businesses, nonprofits, and agencies are coming together to protect these vital ecosystems. Hosted by Trilogy Excursions, and coordinated by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative, and the Division of Aquatic Resources, the half-day charter aimed to educate decision-makers about the values of and threats to reefs, and to engage them in developing ideas for continued and enhanced collaboration. When not underwater, participants learned about reef ecology, cycled through learning stations on some of the more technical aspects of conservation and management, and even checked out a virtual reef—a three-dimensional online reef developed by ReefQuest.org and its 15-year old founder, Dylan Vecchione. “This was an invaluable opportunity for those who make decisions affecting our natural resources every day to join us on and in the water to see what’s happening to our reefs firsthand. Most importantly, the platform provided a chance to explore solutions together in a fun and informal setting and learn from each other’s expertise and experience,” says CORAL’s Hawai‘i Field Manager Liz Foote. Elle Cochran, Maui County Councilmember for West Maui, shares that perspective. Cochran was impressed by the turnout of government representatives and other community leaders with diverse backgrounds, noting “I’ve never seen that happen before—such a wonderful meeting of the minds where we have all gathered together to learn about our reefs and share solutions.” She added, “how many of our decision makers literally get into the ocean to see our reefs with their own eyes? This was an amazing opportunity and I know it makes a difference for me personally to engage in conservation solutions after having this firsthand perspective to see the impacts of our activities, rather than just viewing photos or presentations.” State and federal agencies have identified two watersheds within West Maui as priority areas for reef stewardship. The KHFMA is within one of those watersheds, and represents a new and crucial strategy for protecting reefs: protect the herbivorous fish that feed on potentially harmful algae. These priority areas are being managed through a multi-partner effort—the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative—that incorporates holistic resource management at the watershed level. Opportunities like this tour that can inform, inspire and engage local leaders only strengthen efforts currently underway—and provide much hope for Hawai‘i’s coral reefs.  ###"

        "content": "Coral reefs, the vibrant and diverse underwater ecosystems, are not only breathtakingly beautiful but also vital for the health of our oceans. These magnificent structures teem with life, providing habitats for countless marine species. However, their survival is intrinsically tied to one crucial factor: water quality.  Let’s explore the dynamic connection between water quality and coral reefs, and why preserving pristine conditions is essential for their well-being. Just like terrestrial organisms, corals need oxygen to survive. Adequate oxygen levels in the surrounding water are vital for coral respiration and the metabolic activities of other reef dwellers. Pollution and excessive nutrient enrichment can deplete oxygen levels, leading to hypoxia, a condition that stresses and can even kill corals. Maintaining good water quality ensures the oxygen-rich environment that corals depend on. Coral reefs thrive within specific temperature ranges, but climate change poses a significant threat. Poor water quality exacerbates this issue by contributing to elevated water temperatures. When exposed to stressors like warm water, corals undergo bleaching—a process where they expel their symbiotic algae, leaving them vulnerable. This not only weakens their resilience but also affects the entire reef ecosystem. Preserving water quality aids in mitigating temperature fluctuations and protecting corals from the detrimental effects of bleaching. Coral reefs exist in a delicate balance of nutrients. However, human activities can disrupt this harmony. Excessive nutrient inputs from sources like agricultural runoff and sewage discharge cause eutrophication—a condition where nutrient levels become unnaturally high. This leads to rapid algal growth, smothering corals and hindering their access to sunlight and nutrients. Furthermore, algal overgrowth impedes oxygen exchange, jeopardizing the reef’s health. Maintaining water quality helps preserve the nutrient balance vital to coral reef ecosystems. Sedimentation poses another threat to coral reefs. Poor water quality contributes to increased sediment loads, resulting in the deposition of sediments on reefs. This sedimentation blocks sunlight, suffocates corals, and disrupts their feeding, growth, and reproductive processes. It also hampers the settlement of coral larvae, making it challenging for new corals to establish and thrive. By addressing water quality issues, we can prevent sedimentation and safeguard the future of coral reefs. Chemical pollutants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and oil spills, pose a severe risk to coral reefs. These contaminants enter the water and wreak havoc on corals, inhibiting their growth, reproduction, and overall health. Moreover, they disturb the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem, impacting the diverse array of organisms that rely on the reef for survival. Preserving water quality is essential for reducing pollution and protecting corals from the toxic threats they face. Water quality is an indispensable factor in the preservation and prosperity of coral reefs. By understanding the intricate connection between water quality and reef health, we can take proactive steps to ensure their survival. Mitigating pollution, controlling nutrient runoff, and addressing climate change are all critical actions that can help protect these remarkable ecosystems. Let us work together to preserve the vibrant beauty and ecological significance of coral reefs for generations to come."

We believe it’s vital to collaborate with organizations and leaders in science and conservation to enhance our work, share knowledge, and ultimately take effective actions to protect the world’s coral reefs.  Check out where we’ve made a splash, with the latest news from our staff: During the week of June 27, senior staff Jenny Myton and Mandy Norman represented CORAL at the  in Lisbon, Portugal. The event was an opportunity for policy leaders to set pledges, as well as for NGOs and conservationists to present and learn from one another.  CORAL stood alongside the  , as members presented on the impact of water pollution and the need for effective sewage management models. Meanwhile, both Myton and Norman engaged with foundations and oversea development agencies to expand upon our work.  “In addition to collaboration opportunities, one of my highlights was hearing from Sylvia Earle. She is an accomplished oceanographer and Ted Prize winner,” says Myton. “We left feeling so inspired by her words and urgent call to action.” Concluding the week, various   to expand upon Marine Protected Areas in order to reduce pollution, loss of biodiversity, overfishing, and other ocean threats. “If these pledges are implemented and maintained, they will help improve conditions for coral reefs and ultimately protect more than a million marine species,” says Myton. Not long after the UN Ocean Conference, Dr. Helen Fox and Dr. Andrea Rivera-Sosa from CORAL’s Global Science Conservation team made their way to Germany for the  . The event was an opportunity for coral reef scientists and marine managers to come together and share new innovations, data, and research.  Fox and Rivera-Sosa presented updates on their research, and also led a workshop along with counterpart Brianna Bambic on the , the world’s first comprehensive map of shallow water coral reefs, and its bleaching monitoring tool. They also met with other coral scientists and conservation leaders, both during formal sessions and outside of the conference. “It was so great to finally connect with other scientists in person again,” says Rivera-Sosa. “I had the chance to get the word out about the  , as well as learn about new research and science.”   Next, we traveled within Hawai‘i for the   Roughly 200 water and wastewater professionals attended and both Jennifer Vander Veur and Erica Perez, Hawai‘i’s senior program managers, gave presentations about our work in Maui and Hawai‘i Island. Vander Veur and Perez demonstrated the repercussions of poor water quality as a result of land-based pollution. Sedimentation and wastewater pollution are negatively impacting  Hawai‘i’s coral reef ecosystems, and CORAL is leading initiatives that tackle the problem. Vander Veur focused on watershed management and detailed ways sediment runoff is impacting our downstream water resources, while Perez led a workshop on  Hawai‘i’s transition away from cesspools, which everyday discharge roughly 53 million gallons of raw sewage into groundwater and nearshore systems across the state.  By attending this technical conference, our field staff gathered valuable insights from industry professionals which can better inform Hawai‘i’s state working groups and ultimately implement effective water and sanitation solutions across the state.  To top off CORAL’s summer travel, Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast in Honduras, was accepted into the prestigious   to represent Honduras in the program “Resilience, Protection and Environmental Conservation.” He recently traveled to multiple cities across the U.S. for this three-week exchange.

        "content": "Like the birds and the bees, corals also need to reproduce and continue to build upon the colorful reefs that we know and love. But have you ever wondered the coral animal reproduces? After all, it can’t move and it doesn’t have any reproductive organs.  Let’s take a look at exactly how new coral babies come about and important ways we have and will continue to protect them. Something unique about corals is the fact that different species can reproduce in different ways: by spawning, self fertilization, or asexual reproduction.  When the conditions and moon cycle are just right, an incredible phenomenon called   occurs. Over a period of days or weeks, a variety of coral species will simultaneously release their male and female reproductive cells, known as gametes, into the water. The gametes merge together, fertilize, and form coral larvae, which then float with the current for up to several weeks before eventually finding a hard surface to attach to. This form of reproduction allows for genetic diversity and it gives healthy coral babies the chance to repopulate nearby reefs. In addition to spawning events, some species have the ability to produce larvae internally and then release larvae into the water once they are more developed and have a better chance of settling. This general form of reproduction is known as “brooding.” Lastly, some corals are able to reproduce asexually—which is unique for marine invertebrates. Using different strategies, the coral animal is able to either clone itself or reattach to a new hard surface. This form of coral reproduction is useful during storms or adverse weather events, because it allows broken pieces of coral to form new colonies and continue to live and grow. During coral spawning, there is a high probability that the coral baby will not survive. Marine animals, such as whale sharks, often snack on floating coral gametes and larvae. And even when the babies do attach to a hard surface, they may not survive if the ocean conditions are poor. Poor conditions include excessive algae growth, which is often due to overfishing and a lack of herbivorous fish on a reef, or high levels of bacteria in the water from wastewater pollution.  Furthermore, when severe coral bleaching occurs, it impacts a reef’s likelihood of spawning at all. “It takes a lot of energy for corals to reproduce,” says Dr. Andrea Rivera-Sosa, CORAL’s project and outreach manager. “If a coral is not healthy, it likely will not spawn at that time; however, if the coral recovers, research shows it will be able to reproduce again.”  In order to protect both spawning corals and new babies, it is vital that we improve ocean conditions by lowering our carbon footprint and reducing human impacts. That’s why we focus on minimizing marine threats by working with local communities and partners.  Ongoing donations and support have allowed us to expand marine protected areas,  ,  ,  , and more. Additionally, we are able to fund the work of partners on the ground, like  , who regularly conduct research and monitoring during mass spawning events. “The management of our coral reefs is critical to the preservation of our marine ecosystems and livelihoods,” says Damaris Duenas, research coordinator at RMP, who leads spawning monitoring initiatives. “Learning more about their [corals’] lives allows us to better assist them.” Together, with the hand work of local partners and generous support from individuals and organizations worldwide, we are taking actions and advancing research to keep coral reefs healthy and able to successfully reproduce for future generations. "

        "content": "Did you know there’s a fish tank that produces tasty vegetables, can create economic opportunities, and helps protect coral reefs? It’s called an aquaponics system, and it combines aquaculture and hydroponics to raise fish and grow organic fruits and vegetables.  An aquaponics system relies on a symbiotic relationship between fish and plants. Fish waste fertilizes the growing plants and in return, the plants filter and clean the water for the fish.  , and in the last year we’ve created the conditions for both native fish and plants to thrive and investigated new ways this system could support the local community. In Tela Bay, Honduras, Los Micos Lagoon suffers from overfishing, which impacts the health of nearby coral reefs and the quality of fish caught by local fishers. Over the last year, we’ve been testing to see if aquaponics could promote food and income security for these coastal communities, which rely so heavily on fishing. Cultivating aquaponics systems within the community has the potential to reduce fishing pressure in the lagoon and allow marine environments to rest and recuperate. Native fish from the system can also be released into the lagoon, which could help restock dwindling populations.  This year, Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras, has monitored Tela’s first aquaponics system and is researching what it can successfully produce. By 2023, he will start educating the community and working with local fishers who are interested in creating their own aquaponics system.  An aquaponics system has the potential to grow a wide range of plants—like tomatoes, hot peppers, strawberries, leafy greens, among others. But for the best results, San Martin Chicas focuses on growing produce that can survive naturally in the region, without any chemicals. “We don’t use chemicals or pesticides as this could harm the fish, tamper with the water quality, and impact human health,” says San Martin Chicas. “It is safer to focus solely on organic fruits and vegetables.”  Recently, he started growing hot yellow peppers, known locally as “chile cabro.” The pepper can be eaten whole, in salads, or blended into a spicy salsa or hot sauce. San Martin Chicas thinks these new products might sell in local markets—and it is just one of many potential products and ideas that could come from an aquaponics system. Ultimately, we plan to replicate our aquaponics system to create a larger impact across Tela and in other coastal communities in Honduras. By reducing fishing pressure along Mesoamerican Reef, which is the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere, we are able to minimize algae growth, increase fish biomass, and keep coral reefs healthy.  Thanks to generous support, CORAL has seen great success in Tela’s first aquaponics system in 2022 and we are looking forward to collaborating with local fishers in the upcoming year to expand the project and amplify its impact. "

We are so grateful for each and every donor who continuously believes in our mission and stands up for the health of our ocean’s most vital ecosystems. Your generous gift will fund our regional programs to reduce threats to coral reefs, support local partners and communities, and advance our cutting-edge science to keep coral reefs healthy and thriving well into the future.    Clean ocean water is essential for thriving coral reefs and people. That’s why your support will scale up our water quality programs in 2023. In Hawai‘i, we are using our learnings from West Maui’s   to expand to Olowalu and Molokai. In these locations, we will explore and implement innovative solutions to reduce pollution in areas with degraded landscapes and restore both the land and sea.  Additionally, we are expanding our work to address wastewater pollution in Belize and other parts of coastal Honduras.   in West End, Honduras, has given us the experience to replicate and repeat this project in new locations. Together, working with partners and local communities, we aim to reduce harmful bacteria levels in marine environments in order to keep coral reefs, ocean animals, and humans healthy. Our conservation programs could not exist without dedicated and determined community members who are prioritizing coral reef conservation this year.  In the Western Caribbean, educational programs   and   teach tour operators to reduce their environmental footprint, implement sustainable tourism practices, and effectively educate tourists about coral reefs and how to protect them. Meanwhile in Hawai‘i, our partner organization   monitors water quality by using community science. The data will be used to identify pollutants in coastal waters, inform other community members, and influence decision-makers to prioritize coral reef conservation.  Your donation empowers communities to protect their coral reef ecosystems and expand upon these programs in 2023.  Our science shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if we curb carbon emissions and reduce local threats to coral reefs. Science also shows that greater genetic variability will help corals adapt to these warming temperatures—which is why it is important to protect a wide network of corals, so those that become more heat tolerant can spread their genes. To amplify our impact, we are partnering with scientists, conservationists, universities, and organizations to communicate our research results and advocate for solutions that harness the power of evolution. Your generosity will allow us to expand our alliances in the science community and contribute to marine spatial planning efforts across the globe.  Coral reefs only thrive when they’re stocked with healthy fish populations, which keep algal growth in check. That’s why we focus on reducing unsustainable fishing practices and supporting income diversification projects, which provide new opportunities for families that depend heavily on fishing.  For example,   combines aquaculture and hydroponics to raise fish and grow vegetables. This has the potential to provide alternative income and food security for families in Honduras, while reducing fishing pressure on the reef.

        "content": "As part of CORAL’s development team, I don’t get many opportunities to go into the field. But last month, I joined Field Programs Director Jason Vasques on a trip to Playa del Carmen, Mexico, for a series of meetings relating to our work with the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative (MARTI). Now, not only are trips into the field a little rarer for us development folk, but I didn’t join CORAL with much of a conservation or marine biology background. When I joined CORAL in the summer of 2009, my only interaction with a reef was snorkeling in Bermuda when I was seven. Had I not taken this job, I am not sure I would have ever pursued SCUBA certification. Having said that, w  . In the winter of 2011, when my first work trip to our project site in Mexico was approaching, I gave more serious thought to the idea of getting certified. Not wanting to miss out on an opportunity to see firsthand what it is that I spend my days fundraising for, I signed up for a four-day open water certification course with a local Bay Area dive shop. Fast forward three years later, and as I am on the boat heading out to our dive site in Cozumel, I am reminded of a conversation we have had many times back at HQ: the topic of shifting baselines. As a novice diver, it isn’t uncommon for people like me to jump in the water and be amazed by the beauty and tranquility of a coral reef. The marine life and complex structures are breathtaking to see up close. With only a handful of dives under my belt, I am like a child visiting Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory: “this is in-cred-i-ble,” I think to myself. Had I gone diving 30 years ago (an impossibility given my age, but stick with me here) and then gone again today, my reaction might be more despairing and sad. Of course, having worked with CORAL for five years, I know intellectually that these reefs I am seeing are not as healthy as they could or should be—but they are still a wonder to me. Back on the boat, I ask Jason what the coral cover is; his response is a solemn, “Oh, this particular dive site…barely 6-10%.” Without the knowledge I have gained during my tenure at CORAL, I might have gone through that dive thinking , without giving much thought to what a reef   and   represent. This is a shifting baseline at work. My reference point is different to those who explored those Cozumel reefs back in the 80s and 90s. But does that mean I shouldn’t be concerned? Not at all. Is the situation dire? Yes. Is it impossible to beat? Absolutely not. I am inspired by stories of reefs in recovery or report cards that show improvements in reef health. I am inspired by that 6-10% of coral cover fighting for the chance to survive—and thrive. And I am inspired by the dozens of people I have had the privilege to meet who are working tirelessly to leverage tourism to protect our planet’s precious coral reefs. What about you? What are you most inspired by and hopeful for when it comes to the future of reefs?"

At CORAL, we work all over the world to create networks of marine protected areas. But with any marine protected area, successful management is always a struggle. And it’s something we’re working to address. How do you make sure a marine protected area is going to be managed and enforced, and how do you get the local community and stakeholders to buy-in and support the effort? So naturally when I heard about the PRINMM, I couldn’t help but wonder—how is the area going to be managed? How are they going to get the buy-in of key stakeholders? How will they enforce regulations? The new reserve is going to be six times its current size—it will span across 383,000 acres. And it holds some of the most pristine and healthy coral reef ecosystems in the world. Its isolation and remoteness make it a vital area for understanding how healthy coral reefs function and adapt to global changes. Our   has been leading these research efforts on Palmyra Atoll, located within the PRINMM, to help steer conservation efforts on reef systems elsewhere in the world.

According to the Center for American Progress, a single bluefin can be sold for more than $20,000, and there is an incredibly popular, lucrative, and under-regulated market for them in Japan. The Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument was created by   in January of 2009 by President Bush. The Proclamation states that “the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall not allow or permit any appropriation, injury, destruction, or removal of any feature of this monument except as provided for by this proclamation and shall prohibit commercial fishing within boundaries of the monument.” That being said,   found that although the Proclamation prohibited fishing by U.S. vessels in the area, there are no enforceable regulations to prevent such activities, and that penalties are too low to deter illegal fishing. Further, the study found that the U.S. Coast Guard, NOAA, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife are too underfunded and underequipped to manage the area effectively, and lack the collaboration and cooperation necessary between co-enforcers to be effective. And that was before the expansion. Unfortunately, despite these challenges,   to expand the reserve states that “nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument as specified in Proclamation 8336.” While the expansion of the Marine National Monument is a great step forward in protecting our oceans, I sincerely hope more resources are dedicated to the effort to prevent this area from being only a “paper park.” The work is just beginning, so let’s keep heading in the right direction!"

The day had one goal: to build alliances between a host of organizations that are all working toward the same outcome—a healthy and thriving coastal and marine environment in Honduras. Rather than a formal agenda, each group presented about their work for 10 minutes, and then led a question and answer session that often turned into lively and stimulating conversations where everyone shared their ideas, their frustrations, what works, and what doesn’t. The meeting was purposefully left rather unstructured to allow for relationships to organically form. And it certainly worked. The group has already had a follow-up meeting, and is collaborating to secure a higher level of involvement and support of marine conservation efforts from the Honduran government. This meeting preceded a larger workshop hosted by the  , a CORAL partner in the Mesoamerican region, which brought together over 60 groups from Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.

I chose CORAL because I have always been interested in the ocean, especially as a child, and I thought learning about coral reefs would be especially intriguing since I previously didn’t have much knowledge about them. This semester, I’ve been researching CORAL’s microgrant program. I first compiled all of the archived information that existed on the microgrants they’ve handed out and sorted them by location. I then analyzed the data and wrote up a final report showing which categories of microgrants received the most grant money and how that money was used. Since 1995, CORAL has given out 96 microgrants to 17 different countries. The total amount of money given out by CORAL is $589,724.07. The two countries that have received the highest number of microgrants were the United States and Honduras. In the United States, 21 of the 22 microgrants were given to support projects in Hawai‘i (Figure 1). The microgrants were used for four major purposes: education, mooring buoys, equipment, and awareness. Education has been the most popular category, with 38 microgrants totaling $157,772.95.  Mooring buoys were the second largest category for microgrants. Mooring buoys are a necessary tool used to mark boundaries of marine protected areas and to anchor boats so that coral reefs are not destroyed. CORAL gave $140,837.60 to 22 mooring buoys projects, which funded 300 new buoys, along with additional training or maintenance. Sixteen projects were related to purchasing new equipment, including boat engines, monitoring tools, and cameras that help reduce poaching and catch rule breakers. These tools help protect coral reefs by ensuring marine protected areas are effectively managed and regulations are enforced. The total amount CORAL gave to equipment microgrants was $74,454.82. CORAL gave out $43,200.84 to projects that promoted general outreach and awareness, such as advertisements, new signs, and photographic displays. These more general outreach techniques serve to educate a broader public and visitors about the benefits of protecting coral reefs, and build support for ongoing conservation efforts. The remaining microgrants served various purposes, such as setting up new marine protected areas or the general continuation of the conservation of coral reefs. Figure 2 illustrates the percentages of the total money given out by CORAL to each category. I believe that microgrants can be very useful. Smaller groups or organizations might not get the chance to protect coral reefs without additional funding, and microgrants allow CORAL to work and build support for coral conservation efforts in various countries around the world. I learned that microgrants can be applied to many different categories as opposed to focusing on only a few projects, and I think that makes them beneficial as a way to help coral reefs. Since the microgrant applications are initiated by locals, we get additional insight to what is going on directly with coral reefs in countries around the world. CORAL staff plan to add to the information I compiled to learn more about some of the long term impacts these microgrants have had. But it’s not hard to see that many of CORAL’s successes today are built on successful microgrant investments of the past. What do you think of microgrants as a conservation strategy?

He recently quit his job as villa caretaker and fisherman to focus full-time on developing a sustainable dive tourism industry in his hometown of Bondalem in Bali. This will generate support for his community’s marine protected area, as well as provide alternative livelihoods for fishermen to reduce the amount of fishing pressure on the reef.

Nyoman has also been using his prize money to install more fish aggregation devices (FADs), designed to attract more pelagic fish and take the fishing pressure off of nearshore reef fish. This will help compensate the fishermen affected by the no-take zone that was created with the marine protected area.

So for those of us in our headquarters office in Oakland, California, it’s always a treat when we get to travel to our field sites and see the reefs we work so hard to save. I recently had a chance to travel to Hawai‘i with a few others from headquarters and meet with our field team there. Much of our week-long visit was focused around a single question: what do we need to do in the next five years in order to save coral reefs in Hawai‘i? On the surface, it sounds simple enough. We know that coastal pollution is a primary threat to reefs in Hawai‘i. So as long as we can reduce the amount of runoff entering the marine environment, we should be good, right? It’s once we actually started delving in to that answer, and the process and needs started to unravel, that I realized just how complicated the situation actually is. For starters, the pollution that’s entering the marine environment in Hawai‘i is coming in different forms, from different sources. It’s wastewater coming from injection wells and cesspools, stormwater runoff coming from landscapes, and sediment runoff coming from fallow agriculture land and construction sites. Which means there are multiple stakeholder groups with a variety of interests, complex social structures, and embedded organizational and political systems that all need to be involved in protecting coral reefs. So our work isn’t as simple as saying we need to address the primary threat to reefs. Instead, our work is about restoring entire social and natural systems. During our strategic planning meetings, the word  came up a lot. Traditionally, the Hawaiian word refers to a slice of land, ranging from the tops of the mountains down to the sea, that follows the natural boundaries of a watershed. But there’s more to it than just the land and the sea—there are also the communities, the businesses, the politics and the social networks included in that word. In order to really save coral reefs, we have to restore entire   to their healthy and functioning natural states—not just from the environmental side, but also from the social side. So what does that mean? It means we have to overcome the emotions and systems that are preventing us as a society from taking action toward restoring the health of the marine environment and in turn, the health of local communities. And in order to do that, we must be able to demonstrate that protecting coral reefs leads to good things. We must be successful in the work that we’re already doing—working with hotels along the Ka‘anapali coastline of Maui to prepare them for using recycled water and adopting LID (Low Impact Design) practices in their landscapes; working with the stakeholders of the Kahekili Herbivore Fisheries Management Area (KHFMA) to protect herbivore populations from overfishing along the Ka‘anapali coastline; working with the Puakō community on Hawai‘i Island to reduce the amount of wastewater entering the marine environment from individual homes; and of course, building partnerships with other organizations, businesses, and individuals who are also working to protect Hawai‘i’s coral reefs. If we can do all of this, and demonstrate that these projects have real life impacts, we have a better chance of motivating others to adopt practices that will help protect coral reefs, one of the unique natural wonders that make Hawai‘i special, for generations to come. One of the highlights of the trip for me (aside from seeing whales breaching off the coast of Maui!), was talking to Duane Sparkman, the Engineering/Landscaping Manager at The Westin Maui Resort & Spa. He’s a real advocate for the environment, and has changed the Westin’s landscape practices to reduce their impact on the near-shore reef. He uses compost instead of chemicals, is building rain gardens and designing the landscape to catch stormwater, and is preparing the hotel to use recycled water on their landscape. By doing so, he’s creating a more sustainable future for the Westin, and setting up systems that will lead to cost savings in the long run. And the landscape looks prettier—the plants are healthier and the grass is greener. Sparkman is the perfect partner and spokesman for what we are trying to accomplish. His landscape is a critical part of the  —it’s the last line of defense, the property closest to the coral reefs. Having his landscape designed to catch sediment and prevent stormwater runoff is a major factor in restoring the health of the watershed. And he’s demonstrated success—by putting coral reefs at the forefront of his decisions and actions, he’s positively impacting the business and he’s enhancing the guest experience. “I just want to do the right thing for the environment,” says Sparkman. “If this reef dies, what did I do? I didn’t do the right thing. The ocean is the jewel. That’s the thing we’re trying to save. It’s not about me.” While I absolutely love Sparkman’s humility and selfless rationale, I have to disagree with his last sentence. Saving the reef is about him, and it’s about me, and it’s about you. Saving the reef means we protect livelihoods and economies. It means we protect our homes, businesses, and hotels from wave action. It means we have healthy, nutritious food to eat. It means we can find the cure to horrible diseases and have necessary medicines. Saving the reef is about keeping us, and our planet, healthy. We have no choice but to keep saving coral reefs, and I’m so glad we have such tremendous partners and supporters to help us do just that."

        "content": "UH Hilo, a leader in liberal arts education in Hawai’i, is planning the development of a marine field station at Puakō, on the Kona coast of the Island of Hawai‘i. The impressive coral reefs at Puakō are among the best developed and most diverse in Hawai‘i, making the site an ideal location for coral reef studies. Numerous scientific studies have been conducted at Puakō, because of the unique characteristics, clear waters, and easy access. UH Hilo, UH Manoa, and top universities across the United States use the Puakō reef as a site to conduct research and train students on coral reef science and conservation. The development of the Puakō Marine Center is timely for coral reef science. Coral reefs are in peril around the world, and Puakō has the potential of becoming the best hands-on living laboratory to promote understanding and conservation of one of Earth’s most precious resources. The site would provide the perfect field station for the study of water quality and coral reef conservation and management. With low impact on the area, the facility would serve to spotlight the traditional Hawaiian relationship with the sea and the growing focus on the connections between human communities and their coastal resources and environments. Located on Hawai’i Island and with the only undergraduate Marine Science degree program in the state, UH Hilo plans to develop the Puakō Marine Center to train undergraduate and graduate students, current and future teachers, and native Hawaiians in marine education and provide a base for coastal research. The center would be one of the few field stations in the world dedicated to ocean research activities in which local students are the primary participants. With the academic support of UH Hilo, whose primary mission is to provide excellent undergraduate liberal arts and professional programs, the marine center would provide a wide range of educational and research activities. The Puakō Marine Center, supported by UH Hilo Marine Science Program, will serve statewide marine education and research training needs and provide support for national and international institutions that desire to conduct research activities in Hawaiian coastal and coral reef environments. The facility will build on successful programs and collaborations, such as the Marine Options Program, the QUEST scientific diving program – QUEST, and Marine Science Summer Course Program. Training future marine leaders and developing collaborations will be our measures of success."

Part of this Kuleana is to prepare the land for development. Through grants from the Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Aquatics, and the Hawaii Tourism Authority they are accomplishing multiple objectives. The purpose of the grant was ungulate and erosion mitigation and native plant propagation. Some of the methods used to achieve this goal include installing ungulate proof fencing, using great care to preserve and protect the historical trail that runs through the land, and building a sediment dam to prevent flood waters from carrying debris into the ocean. To help with the high erosion runoff, rocks were used to disperse the water from the heavy seasonal rains over a larger area and over 2,000 plants were propagated and grown by KCA residents, and planted with the help of volunteers from all over the island, over a 10 week period of time in erosion prone areas. A sediment dam in the large ravine helped to capture more than a foot of sediment from reaching the ocean during the heavy rains in December alone, thus helping to maintain a healthier ocean and marine environment. Additionally, KCA has partnered with Liquid Robotics Inc. who have outfitted a Wave Glider to collect and analyze water samples to monitor the water quality. Samples were collected in four regions between Honokoa and Kaumaki gulches. Kailapa contracted the UH Analytical Lab to analyze the near shore samples at Kawaihae to gather baseline measurements. This monitoring is on-going so that we can compare data and record changes. Part of the success of KCA is the outreach and educational programs it provides to the residents and communities. Through volunteer workdays, workshops are held to teach and learn about proven propagation, out-planting, and watering techniques specific to dryland plants. Using presentations, photos, brochures, maintaining an active website with updated information on past, present, and upcoming projects with relevant current events; utilizing grant opportunities to advance the cultural, historical, and environmental importance of our Islands to educate within our community; as well as sharing knowledge with all Hawaiian Homestead Associations and surrounding areas, we are making strides which are vital to preserving a healthier ecosystem and environment for the Native Hawaiian Ohanas."

        "content": "Severe storms with heavy rains in the week leading up to Christmas led to power outages, downed trees, and flash flooding throughout Maui. In West Maui, ocean waters were cloudy for several days following the storms, and while surf was big, few surfers wanted to venture into the murky waters. Murky ocean conditions are generally caused by an excess of stormwater flowing down from the mountains, and bringing sediment, and other pollutants with it. We recently published an introductory guide to LID systems for hotel and resort property owners and managers to help address this issue—you can find it for download online. Low Impact Design (LID) can help prevent flooding on land and murky conditions in the sea by filtering stormwater before it reaches the ocean. LID refers to landscape designs that slow, filter, and sink stormwater into the ground where it is naturally filtered by plants and soil and can recharge groundwater. Rain gardens are probably the most well-known type of LID system. Instead of flowing down a storm drain or into the ocean, stormwater from roofs or parking lots is channeled into the garden where plants remove pollutants and sink the water safely into the ground. An example of a rain garden can be seen at   complete with an interpretive sign explaining its function in reducing stormwater runoff. For anyone wanting to build their own rain garden in Maui, see this   published by Hui o Koʻolaupoko. Other examples of LID systems found in the CORAL LID guide include: CORAL recently published an introductory guide to LID systems for hotel and resort property owners and managers entitled: Print copies of the LID guide are available by contacting Wes Crile at   or 808 359-3689.  Wes is also available if you would like technical advice or assistance assessing your property’s potential for implementing an LID system.

        "content": "What’s the price tag of coral reefs? Roughly $11 trillion. From food, medicines, recreation, and tourism to coastline protection from erosion, coral reefs benefit an estimated 1 billion people. Zoom in, and more than 330 million people reside in the immediate vicinity of coral reefs, and their livelihoods often rely on healthy reefs and their related resources. But, coral reefs face a multitude of threats, and unsustainable fishing of certain species that help our reefs is one of them.  While unsustainable fishing practices such as fishing during specific months of the year or in certain critical fish spawning threaten the future of reefs, so does fishing herbivorous fish. Herbivorous fish are ones that eat the seaweeds that would otherwise smother corals. These “lawnmowers of the reefs” include parrotfishes (  in Hawaiian), surgeonfishes (like  ,  , and  ), and chubs ( ), among others. Overfishing herbivores exacerbates the challenges that reefs already face, such as pollution. At CORAL, we recognize this critical link between  (wise) fishing and the health of coral reefs. While it may seem backwards, how fishing is done can actually positively impact coral reef health, and fishers can act as stewards of the ocean when fishing sustainably. But, when anyone takes too many fish, they harm not only their target catch populations but also the delicate coral ecosystem.  In short, fewer herbivores means fewer corals and less reefs, so eventually less fish. Overfishing causes a vicious cycle of reef degradation. So, why is unsustainable fishing happening in Hawaii? CORAL interviewed Dr. Mark Hixon, Endowed Professor of Marine Biology at the University of Hawaii, to learn more about the hurdles facing fishers and healthy reefs on O‘ahu.  Whether it’s fishing for sport or for commercial reasons, the challenges faced by fishers in Hawaii are complex and rooted in a history of slim fisheries management within state waters. Despite existing regulations, their ambiguity and lack of dissemination, education, and enforcement has created a chaotic scenario. When asked about the current situation of fisheries, Dr. Hixon explained that “It’s essentially a free-for-all on O‘ahu, which has led to obvious overexploitation – a classic tragedy of the commons.”  This tricky situation remains in part because when attempts are made to introduce proactive fishing regulations, pushback from a vocal minority within the fishing community often ensues. They advocate for self-regulation, perpetuating the status quo of overfishing and reef decline due to a lack of necessary herbivorous fish biomass Indeed, the movement for sustainable fishing is advocated by local respected elders, or  , within the Hawaiian communities, who are expressing their desire for change. There is hope. CORAL partner,   is deeply committed to educating our society regarding this need for replenishing herbivore populations. Founded by Dr. Hixon and other ocean lovers as an educational outreach campaign to encourage understanding and action for sustainable fishing practices in Hawaii,   is more than a small   (club). According to Dr. Hixon, “it’s a growing   (family) of ocean enthusiasts, scientists, watermen and women, and fishermen who care about our Hawaiian Islands, the culture, and the reefs that surround them.” The core belief of   lies in the power of education. Its mission is to help people understand the critical link between healthy herbivorous fish populations and the health and future of coral reefs.  Instead of dictating rules,   aims to empower individuals to become wise, concerned, and sustainable  fishermen and seafood consumers, fostering a sense of responsibility toward the oceans that surround Hawaii. Dr. Hixon explained that “for generations of Hawaiians,   has been the practice of living in balance, of right action, and of acting wisely and with good purpose,” so the organization’s name speaks for itself. When asked about the primary way that fishers can act with both themselves and the ocean in mind, Dr. Hixon responded that it really boils down to “being concerned, wise, sustainable fishers who understand that it’s the herbivorous fish that keep seaweed under control and therefore keep reefs healthy.”  ’ commitment to ocean conservation echoes through various community initiatives. Through compelling television and radio public service announcements,   spokespersons convey the importance of preserving herbivorous fish alive, rather than depleting their populations. These messages are designed to reach a broad audience, directing them to social media platforms where knowledge is shared and amplified. Additionally,   ambassadors like US National Spearfishing Champion Kimi Werner and the organization’s esteemed local ocean scientists like Dr. Randy Kosaki and Dr. Kawika Winter serve as role models for local youth on O‘ahu. Each of the ambassadors and scientific advisors has their own unique journey and connection to the ocean, underscoring the urgency of the cause and demonstrating that every individual can make a difference. ’ message is clear and resonant: the decline of Hawaii’s reefs is partly due to unsustainable fishing practices, but is also a result of multifaceted challenges, including pollution. “Reef decline is due to more than just unsustainable fishing practices. But, if you want to fix the reefs that have been affected by pollution, then let’s cast fishers as the heroes that can save the reef.” By targeting less obvious species than parrotfishes and surgeonfishes that are critical to reef health, fishers can actually allow the reefs to recover while still enjoying their sport. This will pave the way for a healthier marine ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Hawaii’s reefs face a bleak future. Coral bleaching, seaweed infestation, and the loss of diverse marine life are imminent threats. “Hawaii’s coral reefs are predicted to bleach every single year by 2040, and we’re going to end up with a bunch of dead reefs with a bunch of seaweed if we don’t collectively change our ways. And, once a reef is covered in seaweed, there’s no getting it back without abundant herbivores.” Throughout his research and career, Dr. Hixon has witnessed the gradual decline of herbivorous fish populations in various reefs around the world and the impact it has had on the vitality of the reefs they inhabit. He shared that he lost his favorite reef in the Bahamas that he’d studied for 10 years: “the whole thing died before my very eyes; it was just heartbreaking, gut wrenching.” Because he wants his children and grandchildren to benefit from coral reefs, Dr. Hixon and   remain undeterred.   and its mission reminds us that fighting for the preservation of our natural wonders is not just a noble endeavor but an essential one. After all, “the best thing we can ever do is fight the good fight regardless of the probability of success.” We must continue to educate ourselves and others, and always advocate for sustainable fishing. Together, we can be the saviris and guardians of Hawaii’s reefs, ensuring they thrive for generations to come."

That’s why we focus on  In 2024 we will be focused on ensuring that all of the marine protected areas (MPAs) and coastal environments where we currently work are appropriately resourced with real-time fisheries data, effective patrols to minimize illegal activities, funding strategies, and proper management plans.  This is critically important over the next year so that coral reefs bounce back from bleaching events. At the same time, we’ll be working towards bold goals to establish newly protected areas. Our ultimate goal is to create networks of effectively managed marine environments that are critical for healthy fisheries and resilient coastal communities. Our science shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if we curb carbon emissions and reduce local threats to coral reefs. Science also shows that greater genetic variability will help corals adapt to these warming temperatures—which is why it is important to protect a wide network of corals, so those that become more heat tolerant can spread their genes. CORAL is pioneering groundbreaking research with global partners to create a satellite-based tool that can monitor and predict the health and adaptability of coral reefs from space. Success in this endeavor would enable us to offer this innovative tool globally, empowering under-resourced communities with a cost-free resource to streamline their conservation efforts and decision-making processes. To expand our impact, we’re collaborating with scientists, conservationists, universities, and organizations to share our adaptation research findings and advocate for solutions that harness the power of evolution. Your generosity allows us to build stronger partnerships in the scientific community and contribute to 30 x 30 (30% of oceans protected by 2023) initiatives across the globe. In 2024 we will be taking all of the best management practices from our successful watershed restoration project in Maui and expand what we learned to new watersheds and partnerships. We’re collaborating with   to strengthen their efforts, secure funding, and prioritize sediment reduction across the state. Our ultimate objective is to share our insights and best practices more broadly across the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific.

        "content": "—Recent monitoring data collected from Los Micos Lagoon demonstrated a 483 percent increase in fish biomass after a closed fishing season in 2021, signifying both higher quantities and larger sizes of fish. Likewise, it showed an increase in diversity of species and trophic levels.  Los Micos Lagoon often suffers from overfishing, impacting populations of newborn fish that later swim into the ocean and occupy coral reefs. According to Julio San Martín Chicas, CORAL’s Principal Program Coordinator for the North Coast, if we want healthy coral reefs, we must also protect coastal lagoons. And for Tela Bay, a community deeply dependent on local catch and known for endangered corals, protecting reefs is essential.  To address the issue of overfishing, Tela’s local government started a closed season every year from May through June, a timeframe which prohibits fishing in coastal lagoons. This allows fish to grow and swim to coral reefs, thus repopulating stocks and minimizing the impacts of overfishing.  Overfishing occurs when people catch too many fish and the stocks are not able to replenish quickly enough. Not having enough fish can collapse entire reef ecosystems and impact the coastal communities reliant on them.  While this initiative originally started in 2010, it was unsuccessful until recently. According to San Martín Chicas, it was difficult to enforce the rules without sufficient patrols, financial support, and  .  But this year, better funding and on the ground support allowed Tela’s “closed season” to operate more effectively. In addition to CORAL’s financial and technical backing, PROLANSATE Foundation, National Institute of Forest Conservation and Development, General Directorate of Fisheries and Aquaculture (DIGEPESCA), the naval force and rangers were involved. In particular, DIGEPESCA provides preferential access to local artisanal fishers, instead of outside commercial entities—which has been a key component to empowering the Tela community. “This year was a success compared to other years,” said San Martín Chicas. “Community members have told me there was much more control on the water.”  Over the 54 patrol days in the 2021 closed season, 36 fishing nets, nine cast nets and three harpoons were all confiscated and donated to social aid institutions—likely saving hundreds of fish.  For the Tela community, this is great news. After all, fishing is the primary source of income and food for locals. A successful closed season can help ensure healthy fish stocks for subsequent months.  Sufficient fish populations are also significant for coral reefs. Herbivorous fish graze on seaweed, keeping algal growth in check. When their populations decline, they can’t keep up with the algae. As a result, algae can smother a reef.  Research also shows that fish in Tela are   to fish populations in the Honduran Caribbean, and possibly the entire Mesoamerican reef region. Therefore, repopulating fish in Tela, can also impact coral reefs that are hundreds of miles away.  In the future, San Martín Chicas hopes the closed season will continue its success. He’d also love to utilize this science-based information to help reform policies. As a next step, it would be optimal if the closed season was more closely aligned with the reproductive patterns of commercially important fish.  By leveraging new data and leading meaningful initiatives, we will continue to address overfishing and fight for the protection of coral reefs—both in Tela Bay and around the world. "

This tremendous effort was led by Arizona State University in collaboration with scientists, universities, private entities, and NGOs across the globe—including the Coral Reef Alliance. The tool is the first of its kind, using advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images to capture valuable information about the world’s coral reefs in depths of up to 15 meters. The Allen Coral Atlas was named in memory of Paul G. Allen, Microsoft co-founder, passionate diver, and philanthropist, who was committed to expanding our understanding of coral reefs and driving policies to protect them. Following his vision, the Atlas will provide marine conservationists and governments access to data about the location and health of coral reefs. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, has been involved with the project since its early days, and sees the value of this new technology and how it can contribute to reef conservation and management. “About three quarters of the world’s reefs have inadequate mapping and monitoring,” says Fox. “So this helps fill that data gap.” This scientific advance comes at a critical time in history—a time where we will determine the fate of the world’s coral reefs. Every year,  , along with   and an increasing number of coral bleaching events. In fact, scientists estimate that half of the world’s reef-building corals have already disappeared—impacting marine ecosystems and coastal communities alike. But this new technology has the potential to help put us on the right track. The maps serve multiple purposes, acting as a resource for marine spatial planning, aid for hurricane recovery, as well as data to analyze pollution and inform proposed policies for fishing regulations. It is also particularly useful when monitoring coral bleaching, a potentially deadly phenomenon that occurs when water temperatures become too warm and corals become stressed. So far, the Allen Coral Atlas is being used in more than 30 countries and for more than 50 conservation projects. It is free, accessible, and comes with online training tools and workshops. In places like Sri Lanka and the Philippines, the Atlas is already being used when establishing marine protected areas. “The right information and reliable updated data is very important in planning and decision making,” says Reynante Ramilo, a Program Coordinator for Community Centered Conservation in the Philippines. “The Atlas maps will enhance our work toward more efficient biophysical assessment of the marine habitats that, together with the community, we jointly aim to protect and manage through the establishment of marine protected areas.” As more conservation initiatives and locations utilize the Atlas, field scientists are continually ground truthing its accuracy. CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager   is a big part of that effort. Rivera-Sosa is working to bring together a collaborative, global network of field scientists who can verify coral bleaching events that satellites are detecting from space. As a technology, the Allen Coral Atlas provides an incredible opportunity for the conservation science community to collaborate together and work toward our shared goal to save coral reefs. At CORAL, we are optimistic that this tool will assist in our efforts to respond to coral bleaching and mitigate direct reef threats, like water pollution and overfishing. “Now that we’ve mapped the world’s shallow coral reefs, we’re moving on to new areas of innovation,” says Dr. Greg Asner, the Director of Allen Coral Atlas. “It’s our goal to support conservation, management, and policy around coral reefs for generations to come.”"

        "content": "That’s right, underwater communities are breaking all the rules and thriving in unexpected conditions. Our field teams are studying these reefs across the globe—from Tela Bay, Honduras to Hilo, Hawaii. Maybe they’re onto something. Could these misbehaving coral reefs be the key to unlocking the secrets of climate adaptation for all coral reefs? We are working alongside the   to study their characteristics because they may provide valuable insights for our conservation efforts. Misbehaving coral reefs are those that are thriving in conditions that would normally be considered unfavorable for coral growth. For example, some coral reefs are growing in areas with high levels of turbidity, where murky water blocks sunlight and reduces photosynthesis. According to Melanie McField, Director of the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative (HRI), “these reefs in Honduras are defying our expectations of what coral can tolerate and where it can thrive. We would expect these reefs to be overgrown with algae and have very low coral cover. But instead, we are seeing one of the highest in the whole Caribbean. They’re not reading the coral reef ecology textbooks!” Climate change is causing rising sea temperatures, increased ocean acidification, and more frequent and intense storms, all of which are placing stress on coral reefs. However, if we can identify the factors that allow misbehaving coral reefs to thrive, we may be able to use this knowledge to help other reefs adapt to changing conditions. One theory is that misbehaving coral reefs may have   that allow them to tolerate different environmental conditions. For example, some corals may have evolved to tolerate high levels of turbidity by growing thicker tissue or producing more mucus to protect their delicate polyps from sediment particles. All corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, but some may have adapted to higher nutrient levels, and we need to research why. The rate of change in nutrient concentrations is likely very important. Similarly, the increased turbidity in some areas may be providing a protective layer that shields coral from ultraviolet light that can exacerbate coral bleaching in times of high heat stress. Whatever the reason for their success, misbehaving coral reefs offer valuable insights for conservation efforts,” says Jennifer Myton, CORAL’s Conservation Program Director. “By studying these reefs, researchers can identify the factors that allow them to thrive and use this knowledge to develop strategies for protecting other reefs in the face of climate change. For example, if genetic adaptations are the key to misbehaving coral reefs’ success, conservationists could focus on fully protecting reefs with these uniquely adapted corals. Melanie believes that “the opportunity here not only lies in the science to discover why these reefs are misbehaving but also in the conservation work to ensure their protection. We need to get these reefs into  . This will ensure that overfishing is reduced, and we can build resilience. Sometimes unexpected behavior is good.”  CORAL and HRI have a shared vision to increase protections of coral reefs that can be key to long-term preservation and climate adaptation. The work ahead will be community-informed, science-driven—and will hopefully solve the mystery of misbehaving reefs. We will keep you updated on these rebellious reefs as we learn more. We are hopeful that we will identify the factors that allow them to thrive and use this knowledge to develop strategies for protecting other reefs in the face of climate change. With the right conservation efforts, we may be able to help coral reefs continue to provide vital ecosystem services for generations to come."

        "content": "Reef-building corals have faced unprecedented damage over the past century, primarily due to increasing human pressure on coral communities.  One of the most devastating challenges faced by Caribbean corals is the outbreak of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), which was first detected in Florida in 2014. Since then, it has rapidly spread to 26 countries in the wider Caribbean, causing severe impacts on susceptible coral reefs. Our partners, Roatan Marine Park and Bay Islands Conservation Association, have been monitoring the progression of SCTLD in the Bay Islands of Honduras for 2 years. Here are some highlights of the efforts made in collaboration with the Bay Islands Technical Committee to mitigate its effects and raise awareness. In January 2020, monitoring efforts to detect SCTLD commenced on the island of Roatan in Honduras, following its first report in Flowers Bay in September 2020. Utilizing the rover diver methodology (swimming over coral reefs for observation), presence-absence data were collected to track the disease’s progression. Over a period of 13 months, SCTLD spread across the Bay Islands, affecting at least 28 stony coral species.  Roatan and Utila were the most impacted islands, with the disease encircling them rapidly at a rate of approximately 155 m/day. Geographical patterns also emerged, with faster disease progression observed on the windward side of Roatan compared to the leeward side. While we don’t yet know the exact causes of SCTLD,   are believed to play a part in its spread. On the natural side,   seem to be correlated with SCTLD outbreaks. For instance, higher water temperatures and specific surface current conditions might be linked to disease outbreaks. On the human side, activities such as   may unintentionally help propagate SCTLD. Some theories point to ballast water and contaminated dive gear as possible carriers of the disease. High concentrations of dive centers and increased boat traffic in certain areas could exacerbate its spread.  Moreover, factors like   – often consequences of human activities – can further stress corals, increasing the likelihood of SCTLD outbreaks. All of these factors underline the complex nature of SCTLD and the need for continued research to better understand and counter this disease. The rapid spread of SCTLD in the Bay Islands underscores the urgent need for conservation measures. The high dependency of these islands on healthy coral reefs for tourism highlights the importance of addressing the impacts of the disease.  Collaborative efforts between non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government agencies, and local businesses have been crucial in assessing the severity of the disease, mitigating its effects, and raising awareness for coral reef conservation.  Our most effective tools for monitoring and intervention against this devastating disease are local NGOs and our dedicated partners. Their intimate knowledge of the environment and unwavering commitment to its protection are invaluable. By harnessing this collaborative power, there is hope for coral reefs. The rapid spread of stony coral tissue loss disease in the Honduran Bay Islands serves as a  . To combat this devastating disease and protect the invaluable ecosystems it threatens, we must come together and take intentional action.  Here are two actionable ways you can contribute: If you’re interested in delving deeper into the research and understanding the complexities of SCTLD and its spread in the Bay Islands, . It provides valuable insights into the disease and offers recommendations for effective disease prevention strategies.

        "content": "Currently, population growth in coastal areas has led to an increase in fishing activity in different parts of the world. Naturally, higher populations demand greater economic outputs as the need for food and household income also grows. Coastal communities such as those in Honduras’ Tela Bay are experiencing significantly greater pressures on fishing resources and, in effect, on coral reefs. Our team in Honduras has spent the past few years diligently crafting the design and implementation of innovative and sustainable economic alternatives to fishing in water that are critical coral reef areas. Through this program we are giving families financial independence while reducing overfishing pressures. One of these alternatives is aquaponics with native species, which leverages the power of mariculture.   Mariculture is essentially underwater agriculture – it’s aquaculture. But, what does that actually look like?  While critical marine organisms like oysters, algae and seaweed can be farmed and raised   of the ocean, mariculture is the cultivation of these marine organisms using their natural habitats. By leveraging the power of the ocean, mariculture creates a lifeline for coastal communities and the fragile marine environments they depend on. The aquaponic systems that CORAL is installing in Tela Bay, Honduras, capitalizes on the power of mariculture for the sake of rebounding overfished areas in order to protect coral reefs. The benefits of mariculture are vast and vital. This approach to offset the consequences of overfishing also helps mitigate nutrient pollution, provides essential habitats for marine life, supports fish stocks, reduces local climate change impacts, and generates income for communities—all while preserving the environment. Mariculture offers a sustainable path forward for coastal regions worldwide. In July, CORAL’s own Julio San Martin Chicas – our Program Coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras – participated in a hands-on mariculture course provided by Dr. Lonnie Kaczmarsky at the Institute for Tropical Ecology and Conservation in Bocas del Toro, Panama. This course expanded Julio’s knowledge on the subject matter as well as his approach to strengthening CORAL’s aquaponics initiative. His participation in the course also starts to fill an opportunity gap not only for CORAL and our partners, but also for Honduras, as Julio is the first Honduran to participate in this program. We hope that by attending and implementing the lessons that he learned in Panama in Honduras, Julio will be the first of many Hondurans to implement this approach alongside our community partners. ITEC’s program teaches conservationists and citizen scientists how mariculture has the power to sustainably alleviate pressures that coral reefs face, especially in the ever-changing environmental conditions spurred on by climate change. Julio is all about science in action and science for action. Utilizing mariculture as an approach to saving coral reefs isn’t just about growing our knowledge base; it’s about creating a ripple effect of positive change. By empowering individuals like Julio and organizations like CORAL with the right skills and resources, mariculture sets the stage for transformative progress in coral conservation. CORAL is dedicated to promoting sustainable fisheries as a way to bolster the resilience of coastal communities and coral reefs. Mariculture aligns with this mission, offering a way to promote economic stability for coastal communities in Honduras while also preserving the threatened coral reef ecosystems that support them. Now, thanks to Julio and this course, we are one step closer to our goal of protecting and restoring coral reefs in the North Coast of Honduras and beyond."

To fight back, we are working with local partners to stop the spread and ultimately save our valuable coral reefs.  SCTLD moves quickly and has proven to be lethal to some species of coral. The disease exposes the white skeleton of corals and increases the risk of being covered in macroalgae. It first started off the shores of Florida, and later spread to Mexico and then to Honduras.  But since its early days, we’ve been preparing for the arrival of SCTLD. By monitoring reefs and supporting our partners who have advocated for funds to fight SCTLD, we’ve made a lot of progress. Now, scientists are applying a topical antibiotic around the diseased patches of coral, while also identifying the species that are less affected by SCTLD and focusing on ways to ensure these corals can reproduce.  Your ongoing support has given our partners the resources and ability to prepare and react to this deadly coral disease. Thank you for fighting SCTLD, and for keeping corals healthy and more resilient.  (Credit: Roatan Marine Park, Antonio Busiello)"

In 2022, we have advanced our watershed restoration project in West Maui, which focuses on decreasing sediment runoff that reaches coral reefs.  West Maui used to have an abundance of pineapple and sugarcane plantations, which are now out-of-use and have left the land degraded. On rainy days, sediment from these landscapes slides down old dirt roads, into streams, and eventually lands in the ocean and settles on coral reefs. When runoff and land-based pollution enter coral reef ecosystems, they can reduce corals’ access to sunlight and promote algae growth. And when there is too much algae, it can take over space from reef-building corals and ultimately, make it difficult for them to stay healthy and survive.  That’s why our dedicated team members and partners in Hawai‘i are restoring the watershed by installing native plants and vegetation to trap sediment and prevent runoff from reaching the ocean. Thanks to generous donations and hardworking volunteers, we have been able to advance the project in 2022 and continue our work to protect coral reefs. Here is what we’ve accomplished so far: "

        "category": null,
        "content": "Could aquaponics and aquaculture be a sustainable alternative to overfishing? According to Julio San Martin Chicas, our Principal Program Coordinator in Tela Bay, Honduras, the answer is yes: If specific fish can be adequately and competitively farmed using small-scale aquaculture, then we can alleviate fishing pressure on the reef. Aquaculture refers to the practice of cultivating aquatic organisms, usually fish, under controlled conditions. Aquaponics is one step up—it introduces plants, such as leafy greens, into the aquaculture system. The nutrients derived from fish droppings fertilize the plants, allowing one to farm fish and grow food at the same time. San Martin Chicas and Paula Urrutia, one of our community scientists in Tela, are testing the theory that aquaculture could be a more ecologically sustainable alternative to the continuous harvest of wild fish stocks. The team believes aquaculture can also reduce food insecurity and increase fisher income. They setup a test system in early 2020, but then heavy rains hit Honduras and they learned the hard way that an aquaculture system should be covered—the freshwater changed the pH of the water and the fish died. Not long after, COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders began, and the project was put on hold. “After taking a break during COVID, we just started the system up again in January,” says San Martin Chicas. San Martin Chicas and Urrutia are using the project as an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of running a local aquaculture system so they can turn around and teach fishers how to build their own systems at home. “Our goal is to learn the fish lifecycle and how to commercialize it,” says San Martin Chicas. “We’re starting with aquaculture and hoping to grow it into a whole aquaponics system so that people can also grow their own food.” A typical aquaculture system uses tilapia, a native fish of tropical and subtropical Africa and the Middle East. But growing tilapia would be a risky move in Tela. “If tilapia were to escape here, it would become invasive,” says San Martin Chicas. “Instead, we’re using a native fish that is from the tilapia family, called copetona, so that it doesn’t have the potential to threaten the ecosystem.” Tela has been hit hard by overfishing over the years. Tela Bay sits adjacent to a lagoon, which is a popular fish nursery ground. CORAL works with fishers in the area to help relieve fishing pressure. “Tela Bay is an area with lots of fishers and they rely on their fish,” says San Martin Chicas. “Trying to take them off fishing isn’t going to work because that style of work becomes their identity. The goal is to provide them with an income and take some of the pressure off the reef—it’s not going to eliminate fishing, but it can reduce the pressure and make it more sustainable.”"

She arrives at the first site at 7:00 a.m., where she meets long-time community volunteer Keith Neal. They put their masks on, unload the testing equipment and Perez wades her way to knee-deep water to collect their first water quality sample. Neal stays behind to watch the equipment. It’s the first of five sites they will collect samples from that morning, trying to hit all before the sun has a chance to break down bacteria. Once sampling is finished around noon, they part ways and Perez travels south to drop the samples off at two different laboratories before making her way back home to wait for the results. The sampling is part of an island-wide collaborative effort that Perez launched as CORAL’s Program Manager on Hawai‘i Island. The project, called Hawai‘i Wai Ola, brings together eleven different organizations, volunteer community members, and scientists to champion water quality issues on Hawai‘i Island. Right now, the Hawai‘i Department of Health samples and reports on water quality at sites around the island. But their resources are scarce, so sampling is limited and inconsistent. “Our capacity on-island has been hit hard the last five years between hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and now COVID,” explains Perez. “If we want to continue to be informed and have vital information about our water resources while our government is so strained, then we need to support our government in as many ways as we can.” The plan was to launch a volunteer team this summer that would regularly collect water quality samples in Kona, Hilo and South Kohala. Their efforts would bring a more robust and consistent understanding of water quality issues across Hawai‘i Island and reduce some of the pressure on the Hawai‘i Department of Health. But when COVID-19 hit, the volunteer program was put on hold and in-person training was canceled. As case numbers continued to rise on the island, it became near impossible to allow groups of volunteers to gather in a safe manner to sample, let alone to be trained. And beaches were closed, so team members couldn’t access sampling sites. Typically, a sampling team consists of three people. “The sites are really spread out and there is a lot of equipment,” describes Perez. “It’s hard to load and unload on your own, and you can’t just leave thousands of dollars of equipment on a table while you run into the water to collect a sample.” However, Erica and other Hawai‘i Wai Ola members have been forced to occasionally go out on their own, taking advantage of regulatory exemptions to access beaches when possible. That’s because this is a prime time for sampling. There’s a silver-lining to the fact that tourism was restricted in the islands and most beach activities were forbidden: the team had an opportunity to understand what water quality looks like when no one is visiting the beaches. “I can’t stress enough the importance of collecting data when people weren’t using the resources.” says Perez. “There were no tourists. Only a few locals were on the beach, very few people were using sunscreen and getting in the water. It was the perfect opportunity to create a baseline for what minimum-use looks like. Then, when things fully reopen, we can look at that baseline again with more people and more use and compare the two.” Perez is excited for the opportunity to gain a better understanding of how much human use and tourism affects water quality—even if it means continuing to collect samples herself with just one other person to help. It’s an opportunity they wouldn’t have had if 2020 hadn’t brought so many challenges. In the meantime, though, she’s working hard to convert the volunteer training into an online platform so volunteers will be ready and prepared to start sampling when it’s safe."

        "content": "The Hawai‘i County Council on March 3 voted to approve the allocation of $1.8 million to address ocean sewage pollution in Puakō, Hawai‘i. The Puakō coastline is one of 14 priority sites that have been identified in Hawai‘i as areas to be transitioned off of cesspools. Across the state, an estimated 88,000 cesspools release 53 million gallons of raw sewage into the groundwater every day. In waterways and coastal areas, like Puakō, it is sometimes mere hours before that sewage enters the marine environment. The Puakō community is leading the way in this transition to improved wastewater treatment. Since 2014, the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) has worked alongside the Puakō community under their Clean Water for Reefs program to address wastewater pollution on the Puakō reef. Along the Puakō coast there are 643 homes that use cesspool, septic systems, and aerobic treatment systems— but due to Hawai‘i Island’s highly porous geology, those systems mean that untreated sewage often leaks directly into the ocean. “In some places, if you flush your toilet in the evening, and you go for a swim in the morning, you’re actually swimming in your own sewage,” says Dr. Steven Colbert of the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo. Untreated sewage contains harmful bacteria, pathogens and nutrients that pose a risk to human health and coral reefs. The increase of nutrients in the ocean can lead to coral disease and cause destructive algal blooms that can kill corals and damage the coral reef ecosystem. In 2019, the Hawai‘i Department of Health allocated $1.5 million to the project, provided the County of Hawai‘i matched those funds by twenty percent. On March 3, Hawai‘i County Council voted to encumber those funds and agreed to the $300,000 match—bringing the project total to $1.8 million. The funds will support the development of a Puakō facilities plan for a wastewater system. “This is a huge win for the Puakō community,” says Erica Perez, Senior Program Manager at the Coral Reef Alliance. “It took a lot of people to make this happen, and we are so incredibly grateful to all of our partners for supporting clean water for communities and coral reefs.”"

Predictions from scientists paint a grim picture, anticipating that by 2050, all coral reefs will be classified as “threatened.” Beyond issues like overfishing, pollution, and climate change, an unexpected contributor to this crisis is sunscreen. Unbeknownst to many, certain sunscreen ingredients pose a significant danger to coral reefs. The scope of this issue is alarming, with an estimated  . The good news is addressing this concern is relatively simple. By understanding which ingredients to avoid and seeking alternatives, we can play our part in safeguarding these vital ecosystems. The harmful effects of these sunscreen ingredients extend beyond coral reefs, jeopardizing various marine organisms such as fish, dolphins, green algae, and sea urchins.  are among the issues observed, some of which even pose risks to human health. Nonetheless, safeguarding our skin remains paramount, given the dangers posed by UV radiation.  The initial step toward choosing reef-safe sunscreen is to scrutinize its active ingredients. Brands that label their products as due to the absence of government regulations and mandatory testing for reef impact.  The top two ingredients to steer clear of are… And the following ingredients can disrupt coral reproductive cycles, damage DNA, and exacerbate coral bleaching: This is an opportunity for people to do something simple to help save coral reefs. Studies have shown that chemical sunscreen is toxic and has significant impacts to coral health and their reproduction. By using reef safe sunscreen, you are taking part in protecting the reef into the future.  The term “non-nano” signifies particles larger than 100 nanometers, making them safer for marine life compared to “nano” particles, which are smaller than 100 nanometers. Several sunscreen brands are paying attention and getting it right. Those listed below offer products meeting the criteria of being reef-safe and environmentally friendly, and not just by putting a badge on their packaging. For your next sunscreen purchase, remember to keep it reef-friendly by reaching for these brands:   Wearing protective clothing like   provides effective shielding from harmful rays, reducing our reliance on sunscreen. This choice not only benefits our skin but also  . Furthermore, embracing “reef-safe” habits extends beyond the beach. Sunscreen residue can find its way into oceans through waterways and showers, underlining the need for responsible practices even beyond sandy shores. By choosing an alternative to sunscreen, we contribute to a broader movement that harmonizes our well-being with environmental preservation. As we make these mindful choices, we collectively create a ripple effect that resonates far beyond ourselves, nurturing a world where personal comfort aligns seamlessly with the protection of our precious ecosystems.  Picking up beach litter, reducing plastic consumption, adhering to responsible diving and snorkeling practices, supporting legislation for climate solutions, and contributing to worthy causes are all avenues through which we can protect and preserve these invaluable coral ecosystems. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, emphasizes that   in coral reef conservation. A multifaceted approach is necessary. By continually educating ourselves and taking meaningful actions, we enhance the chances of coral reef survival. Bottom line: the responsibility to safeguard coral reefs is up to each of us. By making informed choices and taking action, we can be the driving force behind positive change, ensuring the future vitality of these remarkable natural wonders."

She was selected to mentor this course, along with two other scientists, due to her expertise in wastewater monitoring and management with the local community on Hawai’i Island. Perez used her work in Hawai’i to lead panel discussions, as well as answer questions and guide students on an online forum. She shared methods of monitoring near-shore water quality, identifying sewage on coral reefs, and implementing a monitoring plan. Furthermore, she touched on the significance of community-based action and how residents, like the ones she works with on Hawai’i Island, can advocate to save their coral reefs.  Around the world, many coastal communities are fighting for new sanitation measures to save coral reefs. At least 300 students from 32 different countries completed the Wastewater Pollution course, with participants ranging from different backgrounds, ages, and both scientific and nonscientific professions. “I was really excited to see the amount of people who want to monitor,” says Perez. “Word is getting out that you can monitor to create impact and change.”  After completing the course, many students plan to take action. According to the RRN’s survey results, one participant from Brazil is now ready to conduct a baseline assessment and water quality program in Fernando de Noronha, while another participant from Puerto Rico will use social media to educate the local community about wastewater.  “Coral reef populations have become so decimated,” says Perez. “In response, I believe that people want to act…not just sit back and watch.”  For years, Perez and the CORAL team have been fighting to save some of the most ecologically important coral reefs in Puakō, Hawai’i.  Across the main Hawaiian Islands, it’s estimated that roughly 53 million gallons of raw sewage are released into the ocean from cesspools every day.   that bacterial levels on the Puakō coastline are not in compliance with the standards set by the Hawai‘i Department of Health—and that action must be taken.  In response, we’ve partnered with the Puakō community to advocate for a wastewater treatment plant, with many residents understanding the vital impact clean water has on both their health and nearby coral reefs. “I’m thrilled to share my knowledge after years of advocating for clean water in Hawai’i,” says Perez. “By bringing together our resources at CORAL and the educational tools at the RRN, I believe we will reach more people and create a larger impact worldwide.” "

The USS Liberty beached along its rocky shore after being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in 1942. And in 1963 the eruption of Mount Agung pushed the ship into the ocean, making it quickly one of the most well-known wreck dives in the world. It wasn’t long before tourism became the main source of income for the community. Today, Tulamben is known as one of the best dive spots in Bali, and the USS Liberty wreck can see upwards of 100 people per day during the high season. But with tourism comes more people, and more people means more stress on the marine ecosystems. We started working with the Tulamben community in 2013 to help them manage their coral reefs, and the community is starting to mobilize to take action—notably in the area of waste management. As it is in many other places in Bali, waste management is a challenge in Tulamben, especially during the rainy season. Tulamben, located at the base of Mount Agung in the North East of Bali, is one of the driest places on the island. Rain is a luxury there, but when it comes, it washes the volcanic sediment and trash that has accumulated in the dry river beds straight into the ocean, burying the nearshore coral reefs. The village planned and held a community-wide beach cleanup on February 25, 2015, to help remove some of the debris and bring attention to this issue within the broader community. More than 80 people attended the event, including Nyoman Ardika, the head of Tulamben village, and Komang Agus Sukasena, the head of the environmental agency. “We need both healthy coral reefs and clean beaches for tourists to keep coming to Tulamben,” shared Veronika Niken, one of my coworkers here in Indonesia. “We were excited to see such a great turn-out at the event and to see the community really come together to protect their coral reefs.” As a next step, community leaders have begun collaborating with their local government to rehabilitate some of their coral reefs. To further quote Veronica, “We look forward to continuing to support this village. We’re excited to see what the future holds for their reefs and and to keep partnering with them in their important efforts.”      "

The cases highlight some easy ways visitors and locals can protect reefs, and feature a crochet coral reef made out of plarn, or plastic yarn, by The Pennington School. We were thrilled to be able to highlight the Crochet Reef Project and use it to help bring awareness to the struggle coral reefs face around the world. Read more about this project in the article below, written by one of The Pennington School teachers. In 2008, the sixth grade entered into an interdisciplinary unit (IDU) during the fourth quarter. The broad topic was marine biology, but the focus in 2011 was on coral reef ecology. In science, topics included animals and ecology of the reef, reefs as indicators of global change, and ocean pollution. The main connection to humanities was the link to the study of the Wonders of the World, specifically the Great Barrier Reef. In addition, culture surrounding reef areas and community efforts to save the reef were major topics. Math and languages played a smaller role, but there were still facets of this IDU incorporated in these subjects. Each year, the IDU ended with a culminating display for parents and community members. Highlights of this exhibit were projects and student work from the IDU. In addition, the class as a whole took on one major project to showcase at this event. In 2011, the sixth grade created a Crochet Coral Reef. Started in Australia in 2005, the Crochet Coral Reef is a worldwide project which blends art, science, math, and environmental awareness. Our hope was to create the reef entirely out of plastic yarn (plarn), through the collection of plastic bags at school. Students learned to create the plarn, crochet it, and develop structures that mimic the coral and other sea life commonly found in a reef habitat. In doing so, our hope was to draw attention to the consumption of plastic products and the impact they have on our oceans. Our plastic reef has traveled quite a bit since then. In 2011, our efforts earned a place in The Institute For Figuring’s Satellite Reef program. That same year, our reef was on display in our school gallery and then traveled to the Williamson Gallery, Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena, CA. Quite a few crocheted pieces were on display in their Hyperbolic: Reefs, Rubbish, and Reason exhibit. Next stop…the Maui Airport. Tara Jennings (former middle school science teacher) and I were so delighted to learn that our reef would be speaking to another audience, many miles away from New Jersey. We applaud the Coral Reef Alliance’s efforts and we appreciate your interest in our “plarn” creations. “My soul is full of longing \nfor the secret of the sea, \nand the heart of the great ocean \nsends a thrilling pulse through me.” \n― "

I got to see first-hand how West Maui’s hotels and resorts are literally the last line of defense for adjacent coral reefs. Driving the North Loop Coastline Road Hwy 30, you are feet away from the ocean; as you approach Lahaina, resorts grow in size and grandeur, hugging every inch of land to maximize beach access. One of the highlights of driving this road—for the inner CORAL-geek in me—was seeing several of our   signs. Not only was there one at the hotel I was staying at, but I also saw signs at many of the beaches I visited or drove by. CORAL has helped install more than 50 of these signs throughout the Hawaiian Islands, educating snorkelers and beachgoers about the many types of coral and marine life they may encounter and providing tips on how to enjoy the reefs without damaging them. These signs are just one way we are working to engage local stakeholders and visitors alike; more recently, we have expanded our engagement to address water use and land-based sources of pollution. In West Maui, dozens of hotels are partnering with us, keen on learning what role they can play in reducing their use of fresh water and increasing their sustainable business practices. To date, Maui hotel properties have implemented over 30 sustainability projects from energy and water reduction initiatives, to landscaping best management practices, to guest and employee outreach. One outing that really brought the issue of land-based sources of pollution to light for me was a trip to Ho’okipa Beach on the north shore of Maui. The beach is a great place to watch surfers and we had stopped in to marvel at all the talent on demand. From the lookout point, we soon realized there were other creatures vying for our attention: several Hawaiian green sea turtles ( ) were making their way to a quiet corner of the shore to bask, a rare behavior documented only in Hawai‘i  and Australia. As many as 70 turtles have been recorded at one time. The Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund maintains a presence on this beach to ensure that the turtles are not disturbed by excited fans. Descending from the lookout point to get a closer look, it didn’t take long to notice that one of the turtles was covered in tumors. According to  , fibropapillomatosis is a non-malignant tumor-forming disease first discovered in Hawai‘i in 1958. Initially the disease was found only in green turtles, but it is now spreading to other species worldwide. It is the leading cause of death in green turtles. The direct cause/link is uncertain, but   by Duke University, the University of Hawai‘i, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicate that the disease is more prevalent in areas where there is an excess of nitrogen runoff from land. While humans do not seem to be affected by this virus, turtles are the prime victims of this excess pollution; their only source of food is the nitrogen-polluted algae, which ultimately leads to these debilitating tumors and premature death. As CORAL’s grants manager, I have written countless proposals discussing threats to coral reefs; many of these threats degrade reefs over time, dispelling some of the urgency to act now, as the impact isn’t always clear or immediate. Seeing this turtle first-hand highlighted a clear connection between land-based sources of pollution and the health of the marine environment. Our reefs—and our turtles—are literally dying, and if we don’t fix the problem at the source soon, we may have no marine life left to save."

Why protect herbivores? Because they are the reef cleaners. If there is too much algae on a reef, it can smother and kill corals. Herbivores do an excellent job keeping algae in check. The KHFMA stretches from Black Rock to the south end of Honokowai Park. Within these boundaries, rudderfish (nenue), parrotfish (uhu), and surgeonfish such as the convict tang (manini), and sea urchins are protected. Catching or gathering of these species is not permitted. So, is it working, and how do we know if it’s working? Since 2008, before the creation of the KHFMA, this reef has been monitored. With the establishment of the KHFMA we’ve seen an increase in the numbers of herbivorous fish as well as an increase in their overall size. Fish sizes and numbers have also increased in the areas adjacent to the KHFMA, which means more fish for fishermen, and more food for predator fish like ulua which fishermen love to catch! There are also promising signs of improved reef health, though it is still too soon to tell because coral takes many decades to grow. If fish size and numbers increase within the KHFMA they will continue to keep harmful algal blooms from occurring. That’s why more herbivores are mo’ bettah! For more information, visit "

Your guests have to tip toe through muddy water, or jump over oily puddles to get from their cars to the hotel lobby. What if there was a pavement or concrete that could allow rainwater to pass right through it, sinking safely into the ground, eliminating the need for expensive storm drains or gutters, and keeping polluted runoff from entering the ocean? Thankfully there is—pervious concrete! Pervious concrete is a special mixture of gravel, cement, water, and a little bit of sand. Once it dries it creates a durable pavement that has an open-cell, or pervious, structure, permitting water to trickle through. Pervious concrete can be used in most of the same applications as regular concrete, is ADA compliant, and costs roughly the same amount to install and maintain, though it does require a trained pervious concrete technician. Pervious concrete has been successfully used for: If you have ever visited the USS Arizona Memorial on Oahu, you probably weren’t there to examine the pavement, but the parking lot which sees over one million visitors a year utilizes pervious concrete for its parking stalls. For those wishing to check out an example here on Maui, swing by the new Bank of Hawai’i at 140 Hoohana St in Kahului (across from the Safeway) where pervious concrete was recently installed in the parking lot. While there are a number of pervious options for hardscaped areas like paving blocks, stepping stones, and grass paving cells, pervious pavement could be a good option if you want the look and feel of regular concrete, but with the advantage of stormwater infiltration. Remember, the more you can use pervious options for hardscaped areas within your property, the less polluted stormwater runoff you’ll have to deal with and the less of this pollution will enter the ocean.

It’s not every day that you hear about conservation efforts that have enhanced people’s lives, and it’s such a powerful thing to know that communities can really thrive and benefit from protecting their natural resources. So when I hear about how our work translates into benefits for local communities, it warms me from the inside out. I had one of those moments recently when speaking with Juliane Diamond, one of our program managers. She was in Fiji last month, and attended a stakeholders meeting for the Namena Marine Reserve. The meeting was held by the Kubulau Resource Management Committee (KRMC), a local NGO we’re working with to protect the Reserve. Juliane was there along with about twenty other people—a mix of community members, dive operators, KRMC members, local authority figures, and more. They joined together to talk about the year’s progress, and the future of the reserve. When we met to talk about her trip, Juliane reminded me that the Namena Marine Reserve sold over 1,600 dive tags last year—more than ever before. They sold so many that they ran out halfway through the year and had to order more. The dive tags generate much needed revenue for the reserve and not only help fund management efforts, but are also used to directly benefit the neighboring Kubulau community. So these extra funds mean that the local community can install shelters and make repairs at bus stops, so community members don’t have to wait for buses in the rain. The funds are also used to provide scholarships for children of the Kubulau community to go to school. Juliane had a chance to catch up with Sereima Kalouniviti, a scholarship recipient from 2007. She received a scholarship to help her complete her bachelor’s in Applied Science, and is now working for the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. “I felt relieved that there was something there that could help me finish my degree and get to graduate,” said Kalouniviti. “If [the scholarship] hadn’t existed, I don’t know if I would have been able to afford it.” According to Aborosio Dulunaqio, a KRMC member, “Namena is a source of life for Kubulau.” And it really is. Surrounding the tiny island of Namenalala, the approximately 70 square kilometer Namena Marine Reserve was established in 1997, when community members successfully banned commercial fishing within the region. We’ve been working with the community to help them address illegal poaching in the Reserve, and to help enhance the dive tag system and generate more revenue for the Reserve and the community. While the reserve helps preserve such an incredible underwater treasure and popular dive spot, it is also so much more. No one could have said it better than Fiji resident and KRMC member Tevita Uluiburotu: “CORAL and Namena carry the hopes and future generations of Kubulau.” For more information about the Namena Marine Reserve and the Kubulau community, visit  ."

Thanks to advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images, we can detect the conditions of coral reefs in different parts of the world. The Atlas is testing a new   that measures the brightness of coral reefs and categorizes whether bleaching risk is low, moderate, or severe. CORAL’s Program and Outreach Manager, Andrea Rivera-Sosa, is currently collaborating with field scientists in Australia to groundtruth the data collected by the tool. “Many scientists are monitoring right now and sharing information on reef conditions. By matching their findings with the Atlas’s bleaching monitoring system, we can help validate the Atlas’s algorithm,” says Rivera-Sosa. “This will further strengthen the capacity of the bleaching monitoring system to better inform scientists around the world.”  If the Atlas can successfully determine where and when bleaching occurs, it will help scientists better track these events, and help communities advocate for regulations that reduce local stressors in areas impacted by bleaching. Minimizing direct threats, like overfishing and water pollution, while also reducing carbon emissions, will give coral reefs a better chance of surviving and recuperating from these widespread bleaching events, and ultimately adapting to warmer waters. The first global mass bleaching event occurred in 1998, and sadly, these instances have become more and more frequent. Scientists and environment advocates are strongly urging governments, corporations, and individuals to take actions that will help reduce global C02 emissions. As for coral reef experts, we are working to keep reefs healthy enough to survive the warming temperatures.  When ocean waters are too warm, coral reefs get stressed. As a reaction, hard corals expel their small, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in the coral tissue and act as their primary food source. Without zooxanthellae, corals begin to bleach and are at risk of dying if they remain in this state for too long.  We’ve already lost 14 percent of the world’s corals in the last decade and we can’t afford to lose more. After all, coral reefs act as a home to 25 percent of marine species, protect coastlines, boost economies, and feed millions of people.

        "content": "Forty underwater temperature loggers now sit underwater on coral reefs across the Bay Islands in Honduras. Their purpose? To identify the temperature range that corals can withstand and typically experience within a year.  These ONSET TidBits, as they’re known, measure water temperatures every minute and store the data internally. Every four to five months, a diver heads underwater to download the data provided by the temperature loggers. The data gives our scientists a better idea of the types of temperatures coral reefs experience in the area. But it could also be the key to helping coral reefs adapt to climate change. Most coral reefs have a narrow temperature range in which they can thrive. When waters get too warm, many hard corals will bleach—they’ll expel zooxanthellae, tiny algae that live inside the coral tissue and photosynthesize, providing the coral with an important food source. If ocean temperatures come back down within a few weeks, the zooxanthellae will return and the corals can recover. But if temperatures stay high, the corals can ultimately die.  Across the globe we’re seeing an increase in both the frequency and severity of coral bleaching events as ocean temperatures rise. But there is hope. Some corals have survived warming ocean temperatures—these heat-tolerant corals are the key to spreading heat tolerance to other reefs, which will be crucial as ocean temperatures continue to warm. If we protect corals on “hot reefs,” as well as the cooler reefs where their larvae are settling, we can help coral reefs adapt to future environmental conditions and evolve. And gaining a better understanding of the temperature ranges that coral reefs typically experience will help us get there.  Governments, scientists, communities, and conservationists work diligently around the world to put protections into place for their marine environments. So how can we help them design protected area networks in a way that allows for the spread of heat-tolerant genes?  Our TidBit research hopes to inform this question.  The temperature loggers were placed at 20 sites around the Bay Islands, with two loggers per site, about 200-400 meters apart. Scientists took georeferenced photos of the reef along the transects between the two temperature loggers, so temperature data can be compared to a reef’s composition. Now, we can start to answer questions like “can reefs with more species diversity or greater structural complexity also tolerate more heat?” Scientists hypothesize that by better understanding the relationship between a reef’s structure and a reef’s temperature range, we can create a tool that would allow practitioners around the world to estimate a coral reef’s adaptation potential.  Let’s say there is a strong relationship between reef structure and heat tolerance—for example, reefs that are more structurally complex tend to be more heat tolerant. If that’s the case, then couldn’t tools like the  , that can detect a reef’s structure using satellite imagery, also tell us whether or not a reef is more heat tolerant? And if the Atlas is free and online, then couldn’t governments use it to help determine which reefs they should protect based on which reefs are more likely to spread heat tolerance? We are actively working with our local partners to gather and analyze the Tidbit data that is being collected across Honduras. We’re also looking to expand the TidBit data collection to other locations to see if the relationship between reef structural complexity and temperature in the Mesoamerican Reef region is the same in other locations.  With our partners, we’re investigating whether we can use tools like the Atlas to provide open-access information about a coral reef’s adaptation potential. And if the answer is positive, it could change how marine protected area networks are prioritized and designed for decades to come. "

        "content": "Think back to 2020—hospital visits rose as COVID cases climbed, borders closed, businesses and schools shut down, and people panicked. The world we once knew spun upside down in a matter of days. And like so many, ocean conservation organizations, which depend highly on tourism revenue, suddenly faced unprecedented challenges as they worked to protect some of the planet’s most important ecosystems.  Fast forward two and a half years. The pandemic still lingers, but our local partners are thriving and conservation programs have stayed afloat—a truly remarkable accomplishment for coastal communities that watched their economies crumble overnight. In collaboration with   and thanks to a generous donation, we are so proud to have supported many of these tourism-dependent organizations during the pandemic and are thrilled to celebrate what they’ve accomplished. Two local partners worth highlighting are the   and  , who utilized CORAL and MAR Fund’s financial support in creative ways to keep their programs running, staff on the ground, and marine ecosystems protected. Let’s take a closer look at how these organizations found success during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Illegal fishing is a constant battle in marine protected areas, including the Bay Islands National Marine Park, which is co-managed by the RMP. Without patrol rangers patrolling the waters, vibrant fish populations will diminish and coral reef ecosystems could be impacted.  When COVID hit in 2020 and tourism revenue disappeared, the RMP prioritized their control and surveillance program and acted quickly to allow patrol rangers to stay on the water full-time, with non-patrol staff agreeing to temporarily cut their hours. In addition, the RMP found new sources of revenue to make up for the loss of tourism by ramping up their online presence and focusing on digital marketing and fundraising. It turned out to be a smart move—as the island of Roatan saw a 150% increase in illegal fishing in nearby coral reefs that year. According to Francis Leán, the executive director for the RMP, the team was successfully able to increase the number of patrol boats on the water, in order to keep up with the surge in illegal fishing. “The work of our patrol rangers is vital,” says Leán. “If it wasn’t for them, the coral reef wouldn’t be what it is today.”  Today, five boats continue to monitor the protected area. The patrol rangers, alongside the Honduran navy, have confiscated and recorded a total of 905 illegal fishing items since 2020, ultimately improving the health of Roatan’s coral reef ecosystems. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, TASA focused on developing a business plan to support the effective management of the Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, which boasts 342,000 acres of marine managed space within the Mesoamerican reef in Belize.  MAR Fund helped fund this plan, through the Belize Marine Fund and the MPA Emergency Funds Project that was developed with CORAL. The business plan was created by TASA and Blue Finance and puts emphasis on securing predictable sources of unrestricted funds to manage the reserve. According to Valdemar Andrade, executive director at TASA, oftentimes marine protected areas rely on short-term grants, which do not always secure long-term sustainability of an area’s conservation actions and the teams that drive these programs. By putting more emphasis on generating predictable, unrestricted funds, TASA is gaining financial autonomy to successfully manage the atoll long-term.  TASA’s strategy has allowed their team to focus on developing tourism infrastructure, designing a citizen science program, purchasing equipment to work with the fishing community, and much more. “My vision is to make the reserve a model marine reserve for Belize, where users take an active role in the management and decision-making of the reserve based on information received from stakeholders and science,” says Andrade.   By supporting CORAL, you are also supporting our dedicated partners, local communities, and alliances across the globe. Together, we have found success working directly with organizations like RMP and TASA, helping ensure they have the support necessary to carry out vital conservation programs dedicated to protecting ocean environments. "

        "content": "Tela Bay, Honduras has some of the healthiest corals along the Mesoamerican Reef, boasting an abundance of critically endangered species, averaging a high rate of coral cover, and providing an important source of coral larvae for the region. It’s why we work with local communities, scientists, and partners to protect Tela Bay and its natural resources. Most recently, we collaborated with local partners to finalize a management plan for Tela Bay’s Wildlife Refuge, a marine protected area that often suffers from the impacts of overfishing. The plan was recently approved by the government and will now act as a new tool to protect Tela’s coral reefs.  Back in 2017, Tela Bay was declared a marine protected area (MPA). But unfortunately, officials didn’t have the guidance or resources to truly preserve the bay effectively. That’s why we helped the Tela Bay Technical Committee, a local group made up of NGOs, governmental organizations, scientists, and community members, develop a management plan for the refuge. “The management plan is a result of the determination and dedication of our local community in Tela, who care deeply about protecting their resources,” says Julio San Martin Chicas, CORAL’s principal program coordinator for the North Coast of Honduras. A fisheries plan, which the committee created to indicate sustainable fishing regulations in the region, was used as a base for developing Tela Bay’s full management plan. In addition to providing guidelines for healthy fisheries, the management plan now offers information on how to manage tourism, respect local customs and values, encourage environmental education, and more.  “Together, our goal is to offer guidance to officials so they are able to enforce regulations, support the livelihoods of communities, and ultimately protect Tela Bay,” says San Martin Chicas. “Establishing a plan will bring us one step closer to saving the region’s coral reefs.” What happens next is crucial. Across the globe, so many MPAs, like the Tela Bay Wildlife Refuge, are only protected  —but they aren’t properly managed in real life due to lack of enforcement, education, funding, or resources. Our work at CORAL is to ensure communities have a feasible plan in place and can effectively manage their MPAs and minimize the human impact.   In 2023, we will work to secure funding in order to implement the actions from Tela Bay’s management plan, which in turn will protect the area’s fisheries and coral reefs. From there, our scientists, partners, and community leaders will observe the bay, measure the effectiveness of new actions, and monitor the health of our beloved coral reef ecosystems. in supporting our on-the-ground staff and local partners in Tela, Honduras. With your help, we can preserve this ecologically important area and continue to support its coastal communities. "

Much of our work is focused on helping communities develop successful management programs so they can create and enforce local regulations that will really benefit their coral reefs. And the first step is often to design a management plan. We’ve known for a long time that for a management plan to be successful, it has to be built around local resources, traditions, and customs. So naturally, our first step in working with a community is always to learn as much as we can about the area and really understand the dynamics and relationships. Next we help them gather and compile information about their environments, cultures, and lifestyles. This is what we’ve been doing in Bali, where communities have created seven marine protected areas on the north shore, all with significant management challenges. In Tulamben and Amed, both small fishing villages in Bali, we’re partnering with Lens of the Community of Indonesia (LMN) through the Photovoices program to help the local residents document their natural environments, cultures, traditions, and lifestyles through photos. When compiled, these photos tell powerful stories about how community members are interacting with nature and help identify issues and challenges that may affect management programs. Through the photos, we will be able to gain a better understanding of what’s happening to Tulamben’s and Amed’s natural resources, and help governments and local NGOs better prioritize conservation initiatives. The program and photos also help foster a sense of ownership over their environment, and often lead to more buy-in and support from local community members. Forty individuals—a nice mix of community members, local governments, and indigenous village representatives—are participating in a training which will run from April to August, 2015. By having such a diverse group of representatives who all play a role in protecting Bali’s natural environment, this program is helping to foster the conversations necessary to build support for conservation. Thank you LMN for leading this effort! And to the communities of Tulamben and Amed, snap away! We can’t wait to see the final photos when they are compiled into a photo book later this year.  "

This tremendous effort was led by Arizona State University in collaboration with scientists, universities, private entities, and NGOs across the globe—including the Coral Reef Alliance. The tool is the first of its kind, using advanced algorithms and more than 2 million high-resolution satellite images to capture valuable information about the world’s coral reefs in depths of up to 15 meters. The Allen Coral Atlas was named in memory of Paul G. Allen, Microsoft co-founder, passionate diver, and philanthropist, who was committed to expanding our understanding of coral reefs and driving policies to protect them. Following his vision, the Atlas will provide marine conservationists and governments access to data about the location and health of coral reefs. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, has been involved with the project since its early days, and sees the value of this new technology and how it can contribute to reef conservation and management. “About three quarters of the world’s reefs have inadequate mapping and monitoring,” says Fox. “So this helps fill that data gap.” This scientific advance comes at a critical time in history—a time where we will determine the fate of the world’s coral reefs. Every year,  , along with   and an increasing number of coral bleaching events. In fact, scientists estimate that half of the world’s reef-building corals have already disappeared—impacting marine ecosystems and coastal communities alike. But this new technology has the potential to help put us on the right track. The maps serve multiple purposes, acting as a resource for marine spatial planning, aid for hurricane recovery, as well as data to analyze pollution and inform proposed policies for fishing regulations. It is also particularly useful when monitoring coral bleaching, a potentially deadly phenomenon that occurs when water temperatures become too warm and corals become stressed. So far, the Allen Coral Atlas is being used in more than 30 countries and for more than 50 conservation projects. It is free, accessible, and comes with online training tools and workshops. In places like Sri Lanka and the Philippines, the Atlas is already being used when establishing marine protected areas. “The right information and reliable updated data is very important in planning and decision making,” says Reynante Ramilo, a Program Coordinator for Community Centered Conservation in the Philippines. “The Atlas maps will enhance our work toward more efficient biophysical assessment of the marine habitats that, together with the community, we jointly aim to protect and manage through the establishment of marine protected areas.” As more conservation initiatives and locations utilize the Atlas, field scientists are continually ground truthing its accuracy. CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager   is a big part of that effort. Rivera-Sosa is working to bring together a collaborative, global network of field scientists who can verify coral bleaching events that satellites are detecting from space. As a technology, the Allen Coral Atlas provides an incredible opportunity for the conservation science community to collaborate together and work toward our shared goal to save coral reefs. At CORAL, we are optimistic that this tool will assist in our efforts to respond to coral bleaching and mitigate direct reef threats, like water pollution and overfishing. “Now that we’ve mapped the world’s shallow coral reefs, we’re moving on to new areas of innovation,” says Dr. Greg Asner, the Director of Allen Coral Atlas. “It’s our goal to support conservation, management, and policy around coral reefs for generations to come.”"

        "content": "From a conservation point of view, we don’t often think of coral reefs going hand in hand with construction and development. But they do—coral reefs attract tourists, and with tourism comes infrastructure. Coral reefs also provide benefits to communities, and people tend to concentrate in areas where they can reap those benefits. Over the years coral reefs along Maui’s West coast have fallen victim to this cycle. As more houses, hotels, roads, and other infrastructure projects are created, more and more rainwater runs off into the ocean, bringing with it nutrients and sediment that are harmful to the reefs. Earlier this summer we partnered with the Sustainable Living Institute of Maui (SLIM) to hold a six-week course for West Maui’s landscapers, landowners, and accommodations industry professionals to address this issue. The course taught them about various low impact design (LID) principles they could implement in landscape and construction projects to help reduce the amount of polluted water running off into the ocean during storms. LID uses the principles of nature to design landscape and development plans that preserve the natural function of a watershed. For example: If we work to restore the watershed to its natural state, we can divert stormwater from entering the ocean and help improve the water quality for coral reefs. Individuals from seven different properties attended and represented more than 100 acres of coastline. One participant came all the way from Lanai in order to learn more and bring LID principles back to his hotel, The Four Seasons, Lanai. In fact, we are proud to report that participants are taking action and each one developed a sustainability project that they are implementing on their property. “Through this course we invested in human resources and knowledge, and that goes really far,” says Wes Crile, CORAL’s Hawaiʻi-based program manager and coordinator of the course. “It’s one thing to build a rain garden for someone, it’s another thing to educate them on how to build it. We’re building a collaborative group of LID advocates who will now spread the word.” Coral reefs are a vital habitat for marine life, supporting nearly a quarter of all marine animals. By protecting them, we’re also protecting one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. But keeping coral reefs healthy isn’t just beneficial for the environment, it’s also beneficial for communities. Coral reefs are an important source of protein for more than one billion people worldwide—and they provide vital livelihoods for families. They also help protect the coastline from large storm waves. Hotels are also finding it’s in their best interest to protect them. In Hawaiʻi alone, reefs bring in more than $10 million in tourism revenue annually. Sustainable practices are no longer a trend, they are here to stay. More and more travelers seek to support businesses that help protect the environment. When hotels invest and take the time to educate their staff they help build a vital skill set and knowledge that gives employees an opportunity to talk about sustainability initiatives to their guests. Take the Kahana Sunset Condominiums—longtime resident and site manager, Jackie Scheibel, attended the course and she is helping to pave the way with a new public walkway that will provide easy beach access. She is actively using her new LID skills and will use big planters to filter stormwater as it comes off the road and place native plants along the hillside to help stabilize sediment. In addition, she will use pervious pavement so water will sink into the ground instead of running into the ocean. Just imagine what would happen if these LID practices were implemented across large coastal properties—we could potentially divert millions of gallons of stormwater from entering West Maui’s marine environment each year. Help CORAL and hotels such as The Four Seasons and Kahana Sunset continue this great work! Show your support and help provide a more secure future for the communities and industries that rely on coral reefs by ensuring reefs have the clear, nutrient-free water they need to survive.  "

I was born and raised on Oahu, and growing up spent my summers surfing with my dad, paddling canoe with my sister, and working in the   (taro patch) with my aunty. We have an important value of  in my culture, which means caring for the land. This responsibility is a big part of our identity and is the basis for a lot of our traditional beliefs. So I can’t help but get really excited when I see our island come together on sustainability initiatives. That’s how I felt a couple of weeks ago when we partnered with the   to take Alan Arakawa, the mayor of Maui, on a bike ride along our island’s west coast. A couple of month’s ago, I was talking with CORAL’s Program Manager from Hawaiʻi, Wes Crile, about how much we’d love to build a coastal bike path designed entirely with low impact design (LID) principles. Using LID principles like vegetated swales, pervious pavement, and rain gardens would help prevent runoff and sediment from entering the ocean—a big threat to Hawaiʻi’s coral reefs. Instead, it would filter and sink it deep into the ground, even recharging our aquifer. A bike path is perfect for this as it generally follows a contour line of the land, cutting across the watershed at a specific elevation. The path could act like a barrier for stormwater runoff coming down from above. Not long after this conversation, we started talking with the MBL, who were putting together plans to build a bike path along Maui’s west coast, from Olowalu to Lahaina. This area has some of the best reefs on the island, but right now they are heavily affected by sediment running off from the nearby  , or upslope, region and into the water during heavy rain events. This was a perfect opportunity for a partnership. The CORAL team is now collaborating with MBL to design plans for Hawaiʻi’s first ever LID bike path. In addition, we are working to secure funding and support. On June 29, Mayor Alan Arakawa came on a bike ride to see the area and provided suggestions on how to keep the project moving forward. I’m so excited about this project and am eager to forge ahead when we secure the necessary funds and permits to start construction. Stay tuned for more information about this project, and be sure to plan a trip to Hawaiʻi—you will want to ride along the new bike path once it’s completed!

        "content": "The Namena Marine Reserve (Namena) in Fiji is renowned as of the world’s most incredible scuba diving locations, attracting divers from around the world with its unparalleled coral reef and marine life. When snorkelers or divers visit Namena, they proudly wear a round “poker chip” style tag on their gear, which they later take home with them as a treasured token of their time in Fiji. What many people don’t realize, however, is that this dive tag is much more than just a souvenir – it represents a great success story for community-based conservation. Namena is Fiji’s largest “no-take” Marine Protected Area (MPA) and forms part of the traditionally-owned fishing grounds ( ) of the Kubulau community. The dive tag program was born over 15 years ago when the Kubulau community approached CORAL for assistance in developing a sustainable management system that would protect Namena’s fisheries from overexploitation, while providing tangible benefits to the community. In 2003, CORAL helped the community launch a dive tag program, modeled off of a system used in Bonaire Marine Park in the Caribbean. The program uses fees from the purchase of dive tags to fund MPA management and community development, thereby increasing community “buy-in” for conservation and alleviating fishing pressure. CORAL assisted in funding and implementing the first Namena dive tag in 2003. Ever since then, Namena has been holding an annual Dive Tag Photo Competition in which individuals from around the world are invited to submit underwater photos from Namena. The winner of the competition has the unique privilege of having their photo featured on the Namena Dive Tags for the year. This summer, in the fifteenth year of the Photo Competition, photographer Lars Wahlquist won over the judges with his stunning photo of a   nudibranch. Today, both coral reefs and the Kubulau community reap the benefits of the voluntary dive tag program, in what is clearly a win-win for both communities and conservation. More than 1000 tags are purchased annually by visitors and Marine Recreation Providers at the price of FJ$30. The funds collected from the sale of the dive tags are used to conduct maintenance on moorings within the reserve, fund patrols for enforcement, and sustain a scholarship fund for students from Kubulau, which has already benefitted well over 200 students. Namena is now one of the most successful MPAs in Fiji, and its dive tag user fee system is upheld as a model for other community-managed MPAs throughout Fiji and the world. If you ever have the luck of diving in Namena, you can be proud that your dive tag purchase is making a meaningful contribution towards protecting coral reefs and supporting Fijian communities!"

Earlier this month, our team installed two weather stations in the Honokōwai and Wahikuli watersheds. Skye Instruments generously donated a weather station for each of the watersheds we are currently working on restoring in the Ka’anapali area of West Maui. These two weather stations will provide CORAL with information on local weather conditions including temperature, wind speed and direction, rainfall, soil moisture and– best of all – are all powered with solar panels.  The data generated by the weather stations will be remotely transmitted, allowing our Maui program to look at real-time weather conditions at our sites, plan watering schedules for native plants at our restoration sites based on local conditions and determine how these environmental factors are influencing the success of our restoration projects. The data will also help us analyze the amount of rain that triggers sediment to mobilize across the landscape and cause “brown water” occurrences in coastal waters. Brown water advisories are issued by the Department of Health of Hawaiʻi when heavy rains cause flood waters that contain chemical runoff, sediment pollution and waste from overflowing cesspools. Last year alone, there were 167 Brown Water Advisories issued in West Maui. These events are harmful to people and corals, as the pollution from stormwater travels downstream and eventually settles on coral reefs, where it causes coral degradation and death. Armed with the information from the new weather stations and the turbidity monitors installed near the mouth of Wahikuli and Honokōwai streams, CORAL will be able to investigate the correlation between rainfall, sediment accumulation at our restoration sites, stream turbidity and sediment accumulation on coral reefs.  As the native plants we have planted at our restoration sites become established and more erosion control practices are installed, we aim to show that more sediment will be retained on the land. Ultimately, our streams and reefs will be cleaner due to our restoration sites and monitoring programs,  and West Maui will have less brown water events in coastal waters, benefiting both people and coral reefs."

Dr. Colton is succeeding Dr. Michael Webster, who has chosen to leave his role to pursue research at New York University on how life can adapt to climate change. “The Board is very excited about Dr. Colton’s promotion,” stated John Anner, Chair of the CORAL Board of Directors. “We know Madhavi is going to take CORAL to a new level of success with her deep understanding of coral adaptation and conservation. Her expertise in local and global conservation empowers her to translate CORAL’s scientific to save coral reefs across the globe.” Dr. Colton is a conservation scientist whose career is focused on helping the world’s ecosystems cope with the effects of climate change. She has over 20 years of experience in marine conservation and research, and as CORAL’s Program Director, created partnerships with local communities to measurably improve water quality, reduce overfishing and preserve intact coral reef ecosystems around the world. During her tenure as CORAL’s Program Director, Dr. Colton had the honor to support our amazing field teams and their growth.  For example, in 2018, after years of campaigning, the Mesoamerican Region (MAR) team, led by Jenny Myton, was able to convince the Honduran government to approve the creation of a new marine protected area (MPA),  . The refuge protects 86,259 hectares of coral reefs and coastal ocean, and is a welcome addition to a network of MPAs that cover 57% of the region. Our Hawai`i’s programs, led by Jos Hill, have experienced similar successes. Over the past few years, CORAL’s staff and volunteer team have made   in West Maui. So far, the team has planted approximately 8,000 plants that are holding sixty tons of soil a year in place that would otherwise flow downstream and smother coral reefs. Dr. Colton also managed the development of a new science-based conservation strategy called  . She led the Modeling Adaptation Potential (MAP) Project team to improve understanding of how corals adapt to the effects of climate change, and the team’s first paper was published in the scientific journal   last July. The results identify the actions necessary to improve corals’ chance of survival, and the   that provides hope and solutions to save coral reefs. She’s also raised awareness of CORAL’s work on the international stage by partnering with organizations like The Nature Conservancy and guided staff to bring in game-changing grants from organizations like the Honda Marine Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). “CORAL is in a strong place thanks to Dr. Webster’s leadership. I am looking forward to building on that momentum to grow CORAL’s existing programs while also scaling our work to have a greater global impact,” stated Dr. Colton. “By combining our latest scientific findings with effective community-based conservation, we can save coral reefs and preserve their benefits for people and wildlife. The coral reefs of the world are counting on us to get this right!” For more information, please read our  ."

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "COVID-19 has affected all of us in one way or another. Some people have lost loved ones or friends and neighbors to this pandemic. Some of us are now sheltering in place, unable to travel or do many other activities that we recently took for granted. We are all experiencing uncertainty about what the future holds. However you may be affected, we at the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), continue to extend our heartfelt thoughts to all of you, our extended CORAL family. CORAL and our community partners have been working to rapidly change our work in response to COVID-related lockdowns. We wanted to take this opportunity to talk about how we are adapting our approach to coral conservation in the face of this pandemic. CORAL is on a mission to save the world’s coral reefs. We do this, in part, by working collaboratively with communities to reduce local stressors to reefs—like   and  . Key to our success are our local partner organizations. Over time, we have helped many local community groups grow into strong organizations that are largely self-sufficient. However, even the strongest organizations are now threatened by the ramification of the pandemic. To illustrate the challenges that our partners face, we are going to take you on a virtual trip to Honduras to see what life is currently like for our partner Roatán Marine Park, and how they are adapting to their new situation with CORAL right by their side. Roatán Marine Park (RMP) is one of the local organizations responsible for managing the Bay Islands National Marine Park, which at 650,000 hectares is Honduras’ largest marine protected area (MPA)  . One of the biggest threats to reefs in Honduras is overfishing—and indeed, overfishing thought to affect more than 55 percent of the world’s coral reefs. When people overharvest fish on a reef, whether for food or the aquarium trade, the entire food web is affected. On healthy reefs, seaweeds (also called macroalgae) are kept at low levels thanks to intense grazing by herbivorous fish, like parrotfish and surgeonfish. When these fish disappear, the delicate balance of the coral reef ecosystem is disrupted, and macroalgae can grow unchecked, smothering reefs and making it harder for corals to reproduce and for their larvae to settle. RMP is reducing overfishing by establishing sustainable fisheries policies and practices. These regulations mean little unless they are enforced, and so one of the key roles that RMP plays is conducting regularly law enforcement patrols. RMP is also building awareness among fishers about the detrimental impacts of overfishing to help them make different decisions. CORAL and RMP have been partners since 2005. CORAL’s team in Honduras helped build RMP’s financial and management systems, and have supported key positions at RMP. CORAL also financially supports their patrol operations, which enforce local fishing regulations up to eight hours a day, six days a week. As a result of our partnership, herbivorous and commercial fish biomass in Roatán has increased significantly.  COVID-19 has severely impacted the lives of the people of Honduras. On March 16th, the Honduran government closed its borders and required all of its 9.5 million citizens to remain at home. Tourism, once the principal source of income, has stopped. Organizations like RMP derive most of their revenue voluntary fees paid by scuba divers and products sold to tourists at their eco-stores. As RMP’s Executive Director Francis Lean says, “People who once depended on tourism for their livelihoods are turning to illegal fishing practices, which is creating an enormous pressure on the reef. Rangers are continuing their patrols for now but our ability to keep them up is uncertain.” While the pandemic has thrown a curveball at us, at CORAL we pride ourselves on our resilience and ability to discover innovative ways to support our community partners, like RMP. Our team in Honduras is working with the leaders at RMP to create plans to address this sudden reduction in income. They have come up with unique and creative ways to raise funds and drive traffic to their on-line eco-store. They are also looking at how to reduce expenses. To support them, CORAL is directly providing grants to support staff salaries at RMP and other organizations across the country. Additionally, we are also working with our generous funders to seek flexibility in how the grant monies will be spent so that they can be used to support ongoing operations. As of now, we are making headway with funding RMP’s programs but we have no idea how long borders will be closed nor how long tourists will stay away. “The spirit of collaboration has always been strong here in Honduras between CORAL and its partners. If anything, the coronavirus pandemic has strengthened our bonds and determination. We are banding together to overcome these new challenges. Our hopes are high, our minds are focused and our hearts are committed to getting through this together.” – Jenny Myton, CORAL’s Associate Program Director, Honduras. You can help our friends in Honduras and at RMP. You can help us to ensure that we can continue to safeguard our precious reefs. You can help us to keep the momentum going with our conservation programs. You can also support CORAL’s efforts to save the world’s coral reefs by supporting our spring appeal.

        "content": "Deep in the South Pacific, there is a small island called Oneata, which is one of the three hundred and twenty-two islands that make up the Fijian Archipelago. This network of islands encompasses one of the most extensive coral reef systems in the world, and is a critical site for coral reef conservation, with an astounding 42 percent of the world’s coral species. Unfortunately, Fiji’s coral reefs are declining rapidly due to global threats like climate change and local threats like overfishing. The Coral Reef Alliance, or CORAL for short, has worked with communities in Fiji for over fifteen years to promote sustainable management systems for fisheries and corals. CORAL initially began working with the Kubalau community in Bua Province, as they established The Namena Marine Reserve, Fiji’s largest locally managed marine area. The Namena Marine Reserve is a top global dive site, and it also provides tangible benefits to the Kubalau community in the form of increased fish size and number of catches, as well as dive tag fees from tourists. The funds from the dive tag system cover management costs of the reserve, fund community infrastructure projects like bus shelters and have provided scholarships to over two-hundred students to date. The people of Oneata rely heavily on coral reefs to support local fishing grounds, and the community’s food security has been threatened by declining reef health and overfishing. Oneata is far from the main islands of Fiji, so there is little tourism revenue. The supply boat comes every few weeks, and while locals do grow their own cassava and vegetables they have to travel great distances to access other food markets. Fishing, therefore, is a vital source of food and income. The Oneata community reached out to CORAL and asked for help with their locally managed marine area, citing the success of the Namena Marine Reserve. Right now, CORAL is actively working with Oneata to strategize around the creation and implementation of sustainable fishing solutions that will ensure food security and decrease fishing pressure on coral reefs."

And the fishes that we see before, won’t be able to see that much nowadays.” Food security is especially concerning in Oneata, where the distance from the main Fijian islands limits access to food markets. Traditionally-owned fishing areas called iqoliqoli have been used for generations, but overfishing has dramatically decreased catch sizes and catch amounts. On a recent field visit to Oneata, the community requested the help of the Coral Reef Alliance to address overfishing concerns. Soko Ledua, the head of the local fishing group, is one of the community members who worries about the future of fishing in Oneata. For decades, fishermen have sought out the highly-prized sea cucumber, which can have a market value upwards of 50 US dollars each. But like the reefs, populations of sea cucumbers are declining. “Before, just in front here, we just catching (sea cucumbers) here, twenty, forty pieces per day. But here, let’s see, yesterday here we are catching only seven. If we keep on harvesting this one, maybe ten years left…” Last year, CORAL held a planning session and workshop with communities in Oneata to help identify challenges and successes with the current management efforts of their iqoliqoli. That meeting inspired a number of solutions that are specifically tailored to Oneata’s needs. For example, CORAL is working with the Ministry of Fisheries in Fiji to train the local fishing group and community on best practices for sustainable fishing. Fishermen will learn how to measure the appropriate catch size for different fish species, and will train to become fish wardens of the iqoliqoli, to better protect it from outside fishing pressure. CORAL is also establishing partnerships in Oneata to create aquaculture systems in exchange for strong community commitment to avoid overfishing in the marine reserve. One such system is a mollusk and lobster aquaculture pilot program, which will provide a source of food and livelihood for the community while the iqoliqoli recovers. This is the first time that CORAL is tackling aquaculture, and what we love most about this collaboration with Oneata is that the ideas were generated by members of the community. This project will be an important model for how to finance conservation on remote coral reefs that don’t have access to revenue from tourism, and will be scalable to other remote areas of Fiji.

Coral reefs and fish populations are intricately linked, and the decline of coral reef health in Fiji has jeopardized food security in Oneata, where a remote location means that local communities depend on fishing for both their food and income. CORAL is teaming up with local leaders in Oneata to create win-win plans that benefit both the community and conservation. This type of management structure enables families to maintain their livelihoods and, at the same time, builds sustainable resource systems that will last for generations. Implementing stronger regulations against overfishing, teaching community members about sustainable alternatives and protecting coral reefs in and around the local fishing grounds will ensure that the people of Oneata safeguard their own future as well as the future of nearby ecosystems. CORAL has a long history of working with communities in Fiji to protect coral reefs and the people who rely on them. We know that people and reefs depend on each other, and we’re working in Fiji and a number of other places across the globe to unite communities to save coral reefs. But we can’t do it alone; we need your help. Right now, we have the local support necessary to develop durable solutions that can exist well into the future.

        "content": "In early March, 2018, communities in Amed and Tulamben held coastal cleanups to show their support for the third International Year of the Reef (IYOR). Local communities, Reef Check Foundation Indonesia (RCFI), and the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) encouraged youth participation as part of the event. The cleanups helped stakeholders share information about the impacts of marine debris on marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs, which support numerous living organisms. In these communities, coral reefs are the foundation of the local economy. On Sunday, March 4, 2018, Rare Tulamben, a youth group in Tulamben village, conducted a coastal cleanup in their neighborhood and along a stretch of beach. In the past, Rare Tulamben held coastal cleanups every Sunday morning, but the volcanic activity of Mount Agung, which led to community evacuations late last year, reduced the frequency and consistency of these cleanups. The community plans to continue these weekly activities as soon as Mount Agung’s volcanic activity decreases. Rare Tulamben is supported by TPST-Tulamben, a local trash management agency. I Nyoman Suastika, one of the local leaders working with Rare Tulamben, said that the involvement of youth in this kind of activity helps build their awareness of the environment at an early age. Suastika added, “Children usually do cleanups around this area. By doing this, we hope these activities will not only be useful for the children, but also the surrounding community in the future.” Participants of the Tulamben cleanup collected 110 kg (242 lbs.) of garbage, which was dominated by plastic. In addition, participants found Styrofoam, cigarette butts and fishing gear.  I Gusti Ayu Lakshmi from the RCFI explained that the cleanup was part of the preliminary data collection that can inform future trash management awareness campaigns. Lakshmi shared that she hopes more parties will participate in the future to help encourage waste management at the local level. The Amed coastal cleanup took place on March 3, 2018 and concentrated on Jemeluk Beach. Participants included youth, representatives of the fishermen community Tunas Mekar, photography community Klik Amed, the waste management non-profit Yayasan Peduli Alam, dive operators and members from adjacent communities. Participants walked approximately six hundred meters on Jemeluk Beach and collected a total of 120 kg (264 lbs.) of garbage. Most of the waste collected during the Amed coastal cleanup was plastic. Common forms included shopping bags, food wrappers, bottles and straws. Styrofoam comprised the second most common type of trash, followed by fishing gear, which included pieces of nets, fishing line and rope. I Nengah Polos, a representative of the Klik Amed community, said that “garbage on the beach is usually more common in the rainy season because additional trash is brought by both ocean currents and water flowing from the higher ground. Therefore, this kind of activity should be routinely implemented in addition to reducing sources of waste.”"

The CORAL Prize is a unique opportunity to recognize the people that are truly making a difference in the future of coral reefs, and applicants are nominated by a member of their community for their achievements and dedication. This year, we are honored to present Komeno Roberto Jean Luc (Roberto) as our 2018 CORAL Conservation Prize winner. Roberto grew up in Atsimo Andrefana, (Southwest) Madagascar, an area struck by immense poverty but surrounded by some of the most beautiful and diverse coral reefs. Roberto’s dedication to coral reefs and his community has been proven time and time again through his work as Head Scientific Advisor at Reef Doctor, a UK-based non-profit conservation and social development organization, and over his 18 years at the Institute of Fisheries and Marine Sciences in Toliara Madagascar. Roberto leads Reef Doctor’s diverse conservation and development projects including; aquaculture, reef restoration, marine reserve management, and research. He is one of only of 4% of the population of Atsimo Andrefana to obtain a university education; he holds a Masters in Applied Oceanography from the University of Toliara and a degree in Natural Sciences from the University of Antananarivo. Roberto has worked on a wide range of conservation efforts including monitoring coral bleaching, managing and developing marine protected areas and protecting and monitoring seagrass. His research yields important science-based information for all partners and has pioneering new techniques and pushed the boundaries of development and coral research in Madagascar. Roberto is both an integral member of the reef conservation community and an outstanding leader in his community. Atsimo Andrefana is a rural area where over 70% of the population has received less than 4 years of education and 88% of the population is identified as living in either severe or acute poverty, according to an Alkire and Santos Multidimensional Poverty Index assessment. Through his work at Reef Doctor, Roberto has worked closely with the local fishing communities to provide the skills and tools to the local community to protect and manage their marine and terrestrial ecosystems and support the livelihood of around 200,000 rural fishers threatened by declining fishery yields and degraded marine habitats. This, in turn, improves the well being of the impoverished rural communities as well as the natural environment and resources they depend upon, which are largely threatened by degradation and over-exploitation. Roberto’s commitment to leadership in both coral reef conservation and within his community has helped save coral reefs in Madagascar and serves as an inspiration to all who love and depend on coral reefs."

        "content": "In 2016, CORAL began an exciting new partnership with the Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL) at Stanford University. Three key players met to kickstart this collaboration: Dr. Michael Webster, CORAL’s Executive Director, Dr. Jeremy Bailenson, VHIL’s Director, and Dr. Robert Richmond, Director of the University of Hawaiʻi’s Kewalo Marine Laboratory. Although they didn’t know it at the time, their meeting would lead to one of the most popular virtual reality films presented at Tribeca. Their discussion centered around one key question:   The answer became clear when Dr. Richmond, who is also a CORAL Board member, suggested that VHIL staff attend a Palauan congressional meeting to show leaders how their coral reefs looked in virtual reality. This meeting would provide decision-makers and leaders with an immersive opportunity to learn more about coral reefs, their importance, and the threats they face. And then, hopefully, to positively influence the trajectory of future laws and regulations affecting coral reefs and coral reef conservation. With CORAL’s help, two VHIL staff members – Tobin Asher and Elise Ogle – traveled to Palau to film underwater virtual reality footage. Asher and Ogle’s visit coincided not only with the congressional meeting but also with a Stanford University Overseas Seminar, taught by Dr. Robert Dunbar and Dr. Stephen Monismith of Stanford University and Dr. Richmond. Asher and Ogle were able to join Stanford students and staff from the Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC) on daily field expeditions and filmed a diverse selection of both healthy and degraded reefs. The congressional meeting took place on July 7, 2017, at PICRC; Palauan delegates and senators attended the event, PICRC staff moderated the event and Dr. Richmond and Dr. Dunbar gave presentations on coral reef conservation and management. The goal of the meeting was to connect decision-makers and scientists and to facilitate understanding of how climate change and local stressors are affecting coral reefs in Palau and the people who depend on them. After the presentations, Asher and Ogle ran personalized demonstrations of virtual underwater footage from Palauan reefs. Many congressional members had never experienced VR technology before, and for some senators, it was their first time seeing an underwater landscape of coral reefs. An especially impactful underwater scene showed a popular snorkeling site, with tourists inadvertently kicking corals on the reef. Experiencing coral reefs in virtual reality and seeing the threats they face helped attendees understand the importance of protecting coral reefs, especially the popular tourist sites. Soon after the experience, Palauan senators introduced initiatives that would reduce the number of people at popular tourist sites and also made commitments to further research to protect coral reefs. The collaboration between the VHIL and CORAL didn’t end after the landmark congressional meeting. Asher and Ogle attended the 2017 CORAL Prize event last September and led individual immersive experiences for attendees. CORAL staff experienced bustling Palauan coral reefs and saw the power of virtual reality for conservation. VHIL staff also used the virtual reality footage from Palau to create  , an underwater VR film that was showcased at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2018. The film was a breakout star at the festival, garnering praise like “the best… virtual reality experience on offer at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival” from Observer Magazine. The film’s upbeat message helped connect viewers to coral reefs, and its interactive nature contributed to its success. As underwater filmmaker Ogle points out, “When you put the headset on and you feel immersed, that’s really what drives this experience as far as creating attitude and behavior changes for coral reefs.” The VHIL team is now working to bring   to popular Virtual Reality platforms, like SteamVR, Oculus and VIVEPORT. The film is available on Oculus  . Asher believes the message of hope was critical to the film’s impactful debut. “One of the things that was important to us was that it wasn’t a doom and gloom story. We wanted to emphasize that there are things people can do to combat what’s happening, and if we take action we can see positive results for coral reefs.”"

        "content": "Over the past few years, there’s been a steady increase and interest in a number of coral conservation activities that fall into the broad category of restoration. These include coral gardening, breeding corals in tanks and transplanting them onto reefs and growing corals on artificial reef structures in the water. At the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), we frequently get asked questions about restoration activities, so we thought we’d take a moment to explain some of the more common techniques, their potential benefits and disadvantages, and how CORAL is approaching restoration. One of the most common approaches to restoration is to place artificial reef structures on the ocean floor on which corals can grow. In some cases—for example, when natural reefs have been bombed for fish or mined for building materials—this approach may be an essential tool for rebuilding reefs. This is the case in several locations in North Bali, Indonesia, where many of the natural reefs are severely degraded. In response, communities are installing a variety of rebar and concrete structures on the seafloor to provide a place for baby corals to settle and grow. Unfortunately, deployment of these materials is haphazard, and sometimes, when they aren’t properly affixed to the seafloor, these structures become dislodged in storms and turn into wrecking balls, damaging natural reefs. At the request of these communities, CORAL is launching a new project that involves in-water testing of three common restoration materials. Our goals are to identify which approaches are best for rebuilding reefs and use this information to improve coral restoration techniques in North Bali and beyond. Another popular restoration technique is to grow corals in aquaria and out-plant them onto natural or artificial reefs. However, there remain a lot of questions about whether this and similar approaches are scalable due to their high implementation costs. If the goal of restoration is to repopulate degraded reefs, it’s likely that lots and lots and lots of corals will need to be out-planted to have a positive impact on the natural ecosystem. For example, we estimate that there are billions individual coral colonies in the Mesoamerican Reef, which spans over 600 miles of coastline from Mexico to Honduras. How many corals would need to be grown and out-planted to impact this ecosystem? Ten thousand or ten million? To answer this and similar questions, we launched a partnership with The Nature Conservancy’s Caribbean program this past summer. Using a mathematical model that we have developed with partners at the University of Washington and Rutgers University, we will estimate how many corals, planted with what frequency and in what locations relative to predominant ocean currents, are going to be required to positively impact coral reefs. We will use results from this model to develop “rules of thumb” for restoration practices that will help the conservation community evaluate the return on investment for restoration activities. A third approach to restoration is to select or genetically engineer corals that have particular traits—such as the ability to thrive in hot water—breed these corals in lab aquaria and out-plant them onto reefs. While this may seem like a good idea (the world is getting warmer, after all!), there is a very real risk that these approaches could compromise a reef’s genetic diversity. The inherent genetic diversity in coral reef ecosystems means that some individual corals thrive in warmer water and some do better in cooler water. Even as the average global temperature gets warmer, there will be variability about that average. If we saturate a reef with only corals that thrive in hot water, what happens if our predictions for a particular site are wrong and it cools? Or what happens if the engineered corals are particularly susceptible to a disease that strikes the reef? Basically, by engineering a solution and artificially selecting corals for unknown future conditions, we are putting all our eggs in one basket with potentially disastrous consequences. In the end, for these and other restoration techniques to be successful, they must also include effective conservation and management to the address the local stressors that led to reef decline in the first place. Without improving water quality, reducing over-fishing and stopping destructive practices, no reefs—natural or artificial, grown in an aquarium or in the ocean—have much chance of surviving. In this way, restoration can be thought of as one tool in a tool belt; let’s just remember you can’t build a house with only a hammer. That’s why at CORAL, we take a holistic approach to conservation that combines community-driven conservation with cutting edge science. We work with communities to reduce local threats to reefs and improve livelihoods, creating win-wins for reefs and people. We choose locations for our efforts that are connected to each other by the movement of baby corals. The resulting networks are places where corals can adapt to climate change through natural processes. We call these networks Adaptive Reefscapes. Simultaneously, we are advancing conservation science by testing and refining approaches to saving coral reefs. Our work on restoration is aimed at improving our understanding of how restoration activities can be most effective; by sharing this information, we can improve restoration globally."

        "content": "Coral reefs have been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons: island construction projects that are burying reefs, El Niño causing coral bleaching, and the risk to corals from carbon pollution. So it was unwelcomed news when we learned in October about a new study,  , that shows a common ingredient in sunscreen, oxybenzone, is bad for corals. Even at very low concentrations, the growth rate of baby corals exposed to oxybenzone slowed down and they became deformed. When the concentration was increased, baby corals bleached, which caused them to release their food-generating  . Scientists are just starting to understand how chemicals like sunscreens can harm corals. The current study is an important step forward, but we expect to learn more about the effects of oxybenzone on corals in the years to come. We will also learn about how a myriad of chemicals are interacting to create a potentially toxic soup for corals. In the meantime, we know enough to take action. Oxybenzone is demonstrably bad for corals and we need to limit its concentration in coastal waters. Corals are as important to the reefs as trees are to the forest: they build the habitat for all of the other life that calls the reef home. But by knowing that this risk exists for corals, we view this as an opportunity to do something small to help: when you’re visiting coral reef areas, don’t lather up with sunscreen, instead cover up for corals. Everyone can take one or more of these simple steps: As an added benefit, covering up just might be good for you, too. In addition to harming corals and other animals, scientists have identified oxybenzone as an endocrine disruptor with estrogenic effects (acting similarly to estrogen in our bodies) by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) ( ) and the International Chemical Secretariat ( ). When covering up is not an option, there may be some sunscreens that are less harmful to corals. In particular, research indicates that nonchemical, mineral-based sunscreens are best (such as top   ranked  ,  , and   sunscreens). Corals face many stressors that put the entire reef ecosystem at risk. Finding solutions for corals is important for the many species that call the reef home. It’s also important to the millions of people around the world who rely on coral reefs to provide food, protect shorelines from damaging storms and sea level rise, and to create economic opportunities through tourism. The good news is that many places are already working to help keep corals healthy by maintaining thriving fish populations and reducing coastal water pollution. If we can reduce harmful sunscreens from the coastal environment, we can give corals a little more breathing room to adapt to a changing world."

Around the world water pollution from land-based sources is killing our reefs—from cesspools and sewage pollution to contaminated runoff and pollutants. —on Hawai‘i Island, the small, but strong community in Puakō is setting out to change the trajectory for its coral reefs and, could set a precedence for community wastewater treatment state-wide. Puakō Reef is one of the most significant reefs in the main Hawaiian Islands. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designated the South Kohala region, including Puakō, as a Coral Priority Management Site through its Habitat Blueprint initiative. The Puakō community, alarmed by the changes to their reef, reached out to local scientists and the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) to evaluate the causes and find solutions on how to restore reef health. A key challenge for wastewater treatment in Puakō is the proximity of residential properties to the shoreline, combined with the geology—very porous volcanic rock and high groundwater. This means that any polluted water released from residential treatment units can make its way to the reefs. Studies of this reef reveal that high levels of nutrients, bacteria, chemicals and pathogens enter the ocean from local cesspools. The overabundance of nutrients upsets the delicate balance of corals and causes an increase in algae and a loss of coral cover. On February 1, CORAL and the Puakō community reached a   with the release of a comprehensive   that supports the   project. The report provides a thorough analysis of three potential wastewater treatment solutions for the Puakō community and a formal recommendation on the best option—an onsite treatment facility.

        "content": "Biologists talk a lot about biodiversity (aka biological diversity). But what does this really mean? Biodiversity refers to the variety of life. When biodiversity is high, it means there are many different types of organisms and species. Coral reefs have very high biodiversity—more than 25 percent of all marine species are found on coral reefs, which occupy less than one percent of the ocean. And every organism plays a unique role and contributes to how coral reef communities survive and function. When scientists lament the loss of biodiversity, they are not only saying that the number of species has changed on a reef or in a region, but that there may also be changes in how that reef functions. Coral reef species exist in a delicate balance of roles and responsibilities. The herbivores graze and keep algae growth in check. The predators keep the populations of herbivores and weak or injured fish in balance. Parrotfish munch on coral and emit the sand that many tiny creatures live in and on. Cleaner shrimp and fish remove parasites to keep many species healthy and thriving. The pink lacquer of crustose coralline algae releases chemicals that signal to larval coral there is a good place to settle. Each species has a role, and when that role is lost or threatened, the impact can cascade across other groups. High biodiversity ensures the health of the reef. It spreads those roles across many species, so if one species is affected by a disease or other threat, that role won’t be lost on the reef. Biodiversity also benefits humans. Many medical advances have come from coral reef species, and there are still an estimated   species yet to be described. We can only imagine what might be discovered next, from new species to new medical advances."

        "content": "In November 2015, I boarded a 9:30 p.m. flight from Los Angeles and eleven hours later awoke to another dawn in another world. It was my fourth visit to Fiji since my first in 1980, and as I stepped off the jet, I was again welcomed by a chorus of island birds drifting my way on a warm tropical breeze. Fiji is a land of song, gentle people, and warmth above and below. I knew this was just the start of so much more to come.   On this live-aboard trip, I spent ten days on the Nai’a with 17 people from around the globe, cruising and diving Fiji’s Bligh Waters. Our itinerary included a return to one of my favorite dive destinations on the planet—the Namena Marine Reserve. Five years ago I made a day trip to Namena’s amazing reefs, diving twice among its brilliantly colored soft corals and huge schools of fish. This time, I was looking forward to several days’ of diving, to really explore Namena’s wonders. There were many memorable moments on the trip. One I will never forget was on the way to Namena when we twice dove the Nigali Passage near Gau Island. You descend just when a strong, tidal current whisks you along a natural amphitheater at 60-90 feet where sharks greet you with outstretched fins. About five minutes into each dive we came upon 25 to 30 gray reef and white tip sharks who were slowly swimming against the current, making lazy circles as they traveled along. It felt so natural, if not a bit surreal, to swim freely amongst them on their daily passage, as compared to a baited shark dive. Instead of watching the show from a sheltered ledge on one of the amphitheater walls, aptly named “the bleachers,” I opted to swim freely, and as our paths crossed, I got an up-close and personal experience with these predators. If the sharks were not enough, the amphitheater empties into two shallow gardens of brilliant corals that are home to hundreds of species of fish. A few days later we reached Namena. We were fortunate to have Didi Dulunaqio, Program Coordinator at the Coral Reef Alliance, come aboard to join us for a meal and inspire us with his personal narrative about the grass-roots creation and success of the Namena Marine Reserve. Didi is a heroic figure throughout dive circles in Fiji. He continues to work with the Kubulau Resource Management Committee and districts to protect and sustain Namena’s reefs and strengthen the partnership forged between CORAL, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the villagers of Kubulau. Namena was spectacular in 2010, but what I saw on this visit was a noticeable step up. If I had to guess, five more years of conservation has yielded a 20 percent increase in the abundance of fish and the density of the corals. We swam among impossibly large schools of trevally, yellowtail, snappers and pelagics, and thousands of golden, orange and pink anthias colored every dive. To see one enormous Napoleon wrasse on a dive is a treat; how about six together? And while catching a glimpse of a pygmy seahorse camouflaged in coral is not atypical on a multi-day dive trip, how about settling in with two pregnant pygmies free swimming back and forth between their perches? Or surfacing from a fantastic dive, only to jump into the water again to free swim for twenty minutes among a school of five manta rays – they seemed just as interested in showing off for us as we were in swimming with them. I’ve been diving on coral reefs since I was 10-years-old. Times are tough for corals, including on some of Fiji’s reefs. But this return to Namena and the Bligh Waters gave me a great deal of hope. It’s evident that when communities unite to save their coral reefs and forge alliances with organizations like CORAL, who have the experience and expertise to help them help themselves, the results can be spectacular. And success in one location has a domino effect on nearby communities who soon want to follow the formula and sustain their reefs. My return to the coral gardens of Namena left me thankful and proud of what collaborative conservation can, and will, accomplish for coral reefs around the world.  "

This stems not only from my personal love of nature but from my belief that all life is interrelated, a belief that drives my work with the Coral Reef Alliance. I learned this early through the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant that explains how life began, our shared genealogy. The ancient chant is more than two thousand lines, practiced, learned and shared over generations. The Kumulipo begins with cosmic darkness. At the time when the earth became hot At the time when the heavens turned about At the time when the sun was darkened To cause the moon to shine The time of the rise of the Pleiades The slime, this was the source of the earth The source of the darkness that made darkness The source of the night that made night The intense darkness, the deep darkness Darkness of the sun, darkness of the night Nothing but night The night gave birth Born was Kumulipo in the night, a male Born was Po‘ele in the night, a female The Kumulipo tells us that the Ko’a, or coral polyp, was the first organism created. The Ko’a was followed by seastars, cucumbers, and urchins, each increasing in complexity. Early translators of the chant noted that the order of species closely matches the biological groupings we use today. Born was the starfish, his child the small starfish came forth Born was the sea cucumber, his child the small sea cucumber came forth Born was the sea urchin, the sea urchin [tribe] The chant teaches us that life in the sea and life on land are inexorably connected, and what we do on land has a direct connection and impact on all organisms in the sea. Hawaiians recognize that these organisms are the building blocks for all life on this shared planet we call Honua. There is a resurgence of interest in the chant as people look for the traditional knowledge of ecological connections. The Kumulipo is always in the background of people’s minds. Born was the tough seagrass living in the sea Guarded by the tough landgrass living on land It is our   (responsibility) to preserve and protect all living organisms because we all come from the same primordial beginnings– ­from the night, from the slime, from the coral polyp. These lessons of the Kumulipo are deeply integrated into our consciousness. It’s something we feel in our  (deep within our being). We are all related, part of one   (family), and it is our responsibility to care for the land under our feet, the sea around us, and our coral reefs.

The Roatan Marine Park (RMP) in Honduras is an inspiring example of how conservation efforts lead to great things. The success and growth they’ve shown are tremendous. Last year, CORAL invested in the sustainability of RMP with a $12,000 grant to hire a sustainable finance coordinator. The new position was designed to help them diversify income streams and build relationships within the private sector. The goal was to increase their capacity so they can expand to new areas of the island and continue to protect Roatan’s unique natural beauty. With the new coordinator, the RMP has grown its membership base by 40 percent—they’ve built stronger relationships with donors, businesses, and community members. They also helped create a U.S. 501(c)3, which allows them to fundraise in the United States. “A lot of visitors come here and want to make a tax-deductible donation to the park,” says Jenny Myton, CORAL’s associate programs director based in Honduras. “This new 501(c)3 makes that possible.” As a result of the coordinator’s hard work, the RMP just received a $100,000 donation from a popular clothing brand. The unrestricted donation will support the sustainable finance coordinator position for the next four years and will help pay for necessary marine management, patrols and community development projects. “The RMP is reaching a new level of independence,” says Myton. “It’s exciting to see that CORAL’s initial investment is paying off. Communities can finance their conservation efforts, and we can use this example as a blueprint for other communities around the world.”"

Launched in 2012 with a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, RTI’s goal was to understand how multiple factors—for example, wave energy, herbivores, and the distribution of coral species on a reef—interact to affect the health of a coral reef. In conjunction with our scientific research, we worked with coral reef managers around the world to understand how they use science to inform their management decisions. We based our scientific research on the remote atoll of Palmyra in the central Pacific. Armed with cameras, clipboards, settlement tiles, temperature data loggers and more, we collected a truly staggering amount of biological, physical, and ecological data. Simultaneously, we worked with communities around the world—including partners in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Palau—to make sure that our scientific work was relevant to conservation and management challenges. Now that we have completed RTI, I wanted to share some of our key findings: We have combined these and other findings into a mathematical model that allows us to explore how climate change might affect reef health by increasing the frequency and intensity of disturbance events. If we know how healthy reefs, like those at Palmyra, can withstand change and recover from disturbance, we may be able to unlock the key to this resilience for other reefs around the globe. While funding for RTI has ended, our collaborative work will continue for years to come as we build on what we have learned from Palmyra and our work with communities around the world."

        "content": "A plane flies low over a turquoise sea off the coast of Queensland in northern Australia. Below lies the largest reef in the world: the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). At first, I think—or maybe it’s hope—that the white patches are boulders or cresting wavelets. But as the plane flies on, their true identity becomes undeniably clear: these are bleached corals. And there are a lot of them. As   taken by researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies makes clear, the GBR is in trouble. Reports indicate that up to 93 percent of corals in the northern part of the reef have bleached. But it’s not just the GBR that’s reporting bleaching: corals in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean, north and south Pacific, and coral triangle are all turning bone-white. What does it mean to say that a coral is bleached? Corals get their colors from tiny algae that live within their tissues. These algae help corals grow by capturing energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. When waters get too warm for too long, these algae go into overdrive and their ramped up metabolism creates a toxic environment for corals. In response, the algae get kicked out, and the corals lose their color. Bleached corals aren’t necessarily dead corals, but the longer the bleaching continues, the lower the chance is that the corals will be able to recover. The current bleaching in the GBR is part of the third recorded global bleaching event. It’s the result of a particularly strong   occurring on top of already elevated global temperatures. Any single event is worrisome, but scientists are seeing an increase in the frequency of bleaching events. This means that corals don’t have the time they need to recover, and this has many people very worried. Only time will tell us how many—or how few—corals will survive this latest event. I had been reading reports of bleaching from around the world for months before I saw that video, so I should have known what to expect. But those thousands of words had not prepared me for a minute-long video. Those of us in conservation like to joke that we are trying really hard to put ourselves out of work. How great would it be if coral reefs no longer needed our help? I have never been so saddened by job security than when I saw all those bleached corals. We have a lot of work still to do. So what can we do? We can reduce local threats to reefs—such as overfishing and water pollution—so that reefs have ‘breathing room’ to recover from disturbances like bleaching. We can urge our politicians to take action on climate change. And we can find ways to support the many communities around the world that are working to protect coral reefs, one of the most wondrous ecosystems on earth."

They live in warm waters at 2-40 meters deep in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and can grow up to 12 inches (31 cm) long. Blue Tang are one of more than 70 species of surgeonfish, a group of fish known for the very sharp spines near the tail. They normally hold these spines close to their body, but they can extend them when threatened. When they are young, they feed exclusively on plankton. As adults they are omnivores, eating both algae and invertebrates, including plankton. Royal Blue tangs play an important role in maintaining the health and balance of coral reefs. Herbivores graze the algae (seaweed) on reefs, similar to cattle or sheep in a field. These herbivores keep the algae in check and keep space open for corals to grown and settle. Without herbivores, algae can overgrow and crowd out corals. Coral reef structure is important to blue tangs who hide in coral branches, crevices and holes to avoid predators like groupers, bar jacks and tuna. Despite how endearing Dory might appear in the movies, the real blue tangs do not make good pets because they need large tanks (which are expensive), a carefully balanced diet, and they are susceptible to disease—therefore they need very experienced aquarists to take care of them. Because this species cannot be bred in captivity, they are currently collected from coral reefs and there is concern that increased demand as a result of  will put too much pressure on wild populations. For all these reasons, this species is better left on a reef or enjoyed at a responsible public aquarium."

        "content": "Coral reefs around the world are being hit hard by many stressors. At the local level, they’re dealing with issues like overfishing and poor water quality. At the global level, they’re facing warming temperatures, more acidic oceans, and stronger storms. With effective management, we can mitigate many local threats. But the global ones are a bit harder. It’s clear that if corals are going to survive global climate change, they are going to have to adapt. The good news is that we know that corals can adapt. They have evolved numerous ways to deal with environmental conditions – for example, some corals thrive in murky river mouths while others flourish in warm-water lagoons. But the pace of climate change is rapid, leaving corals with a small window in which to adjust to rapidly changing conditions. So what can we do to help corals adapt? This was the topic of one of Monday’s sessions at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS). Lead by our very own Dr. Madhavi Colton, the session brought together experts in coral reef biology, genetics, and ecology to answer this very question. Many of the talks in this session focused on assisted evolution—that is, speeding up evolution through direct management. For example, one speaker shared her work creating hybrid corals—similar to work being done to create hybrid tomatoes. If you breed the sperm from one species of coral with the egg from another, can you create a coral that will do better under future conditions? Dr. Adrian Stier of the University of Washington called these predict-and-prescribe approaches. Predict-and-prescribe approaches place bets about what future conditions will look like and which corals will do better under these conditions. If those predictions are correct, then these strategies can be incredibly effective. But according to Stier, they are also inherently risky because they are focused on a few species or genes. What if those bets are wrong? We risk losing the very diversity from which climate change winners could naturally emerge. Instead, Stier advocated following Warren Buffet’s example. Financial markets are like ecosystems in that they are inherently unpredictable (despite what your financial manager might have told you!). In the face of this uncertain future, a smart investment decision is to hedge your bets and diversify your portfolio. Through diverse investments, you are less likely to lose everything and more likely to consistently gets better returns. We can do the same for coral reefs, Stier said. Instead of investing all of our efforts into creating corals of the future, we can protect diverse portfolios of options. We can let nature pick the winners. As one member of the audience stated, if we focus our efforts on reducing local threats—many local threats, not just one or two—and building marine protected areas that are connected to each other, we’ll have a better chance of corals adapting to future environmental changes."

        "content": "For many years, few people paid attention to the impacts that poor water quality has on coral reefs. But this is changing. At the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), many sessions focused on discussing this important issue. Never has the CORAL team been so excited to hear so many talks on sewage, sedimentation, and runoff! Poor water quality impacts most of the reefs around the world. When polluted water enters the ocean, it carries both sediment and nutrients. Sediment can smother a reef, blocking out the sunlight that corals need in order to grow. Nutrients fuel the growth of algae and seaweeds which compete with corals for space. According to a talk by Stephanie Wear of The Nature Conservancy, high levels of nutrients can also lead to higher incidences of coral disease and bleaching. This is particularly relevant today when we’re in the middle of the third global bleaching event. But as Wear pointed out, our efforts to address reef threats are unbalanced: there is more focus on combatting overfishing than on addressing poor water quality. We know that to help corals deal with climate change, we need to reduce all local threats to reefs so that they have the ‘breathing room’ to adapt. However, poor water quality is a complicated issue to address. Often our water quality standards are designed with human health in mind, but this may not be enough to keep corals safe. Also, addressing poor water quality usually means heavy upfront capital investments in infrastructure, which can be a significant hurdle for many communities. The good news is that we know what we need to do. The first step is to help local communities understand the effects of land-based pollution on coral reefs. Dr. Tracy Wiegner’s project at the University of Hawai‘i is a great example of that. A partner with our   project, Wiegner, and her team have helped the Puakō community on Hawai‘i Island understand the effects of poor water quality on their local reef. Their study found that cesspools leak sewage into the nearshore environment in as little as six hours. According to Wiegner, there are 90,000 cesspools in the state of Hawaii, and 50,000 of those are on Hawai‘i Island. Hawai‘i is the last state in the US to ban cesspools, and the second to last state banned them 50 years ago. Work like that of Dr. Wiegner shows linkages between land and reefs, and can be instrumental in motivating communities to take action. The next step is to connect communities with the tools and resources they need to address water pollution. We’re already doing this on  , on  , and in  . With the amount of attention poor water quality received at ICRS this year, we’re optimistic that we will see an increase in global efforts to address these threats in the coming years."

        "content": "Overfishing is a widespread problem across our oceans. As our global human population quickly approaches eight billion, pressures on these ocean resources will only increase. That means bad news for coral reef fish. They are even more vulnerable to overfishing than pelagic (open ocean) fish because of their biology, said Dr. Charles Birkeland in his Tuesday morning plenary session at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS). Coral reef fish are slow growing and long-lived, and there’s ample evidence that older, bigger fish are more fertile and produce young that are better equipped to survive the larval phase. Coral reef fish play a vital role in the coral reef network of life. For example, herbivores, or grazing fish, eat algae and seaweeds and can prevent them from overgrowing corals on a reef. In this morning’s plenary address, Dr. Pete Mumby explained that coral larvae, or baby corals, are less likely to settle on a reef where algae is present. By keeping algae in check, herbivorous reef fish can facilitate coral recruitment and reef recovery. Coral reef fish are also the lifeline for many communities, providing an important source of food and income. That income can come directly from the sale of fish, and can also be generated by tourism (let’s be real, who doesn’t love to see reef fish while on a dive?). Combatting overfishing can therefore benefit communities in multiple ways. For example, one study from Palau quantified the value of sharks to tourism as compared to fisheries and found that sharks were much more valuable alive than dead. The same study found that tax revenue from scuba tourism was 24 times higher than the total revenue of the fishing industry. Birkeland suggested that communities will benefit by limiting reef fish to local markets rather than exporting them. In fact, Palau banned the export of coral reef fish, which has been great news for both reefs and the communities that rely on them. It’s no wonder that so many efforts focus on addressing overfishing on reefs. The stakes are high—500 million people rely on coral reefs. But is addressing overfishing alone really enough to save our coral reefs? Melanie McField from the Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI) says perhaps not in the Caribbean. In a new study of the Mesoamerican Reef region, McField found that the presence of algae on a reef did not correlate with the population of herbivores. External factors like poor water quality also contributed to reef decline. This means that protecting herbivores alone won’t save coral reefs: it’s important to combat overfishing in conjunction with cleaning up water quality, which is what we are doing in Honduras. This is a common thread at ICRS this year. As you’ve read over the last few days, it’s not enough to address a single threat in isolation. We need to take a holistic approach to addressing multiple local threats if coral reefs are going to adapt to the many global changes coming their way."

        "content": "Last year, over 190 countries came together in France for the 21  session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21). They negotiated the Paris Agreement—a global agreement on limiting global warming. It was a great example of setting ambitious policy to protect our natural resources. COP 21 has been a popular topic at this year’s International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), the theme of which is bridging science with policy. It’s an important topic—how can we build a stronger partnership between scientists and policy makers to protect coral reefs? For example, the parties at COP 21 vowed to pursue efforts to limit global warming to under 2.0 C; however, according to Dr. Janice Lough in this morning’s plenary session, a 1.5 C increase in temperatures would have drastic effects on coral reefs. Using data from a variety of sources, Dr. Lough showed that our Earth has already warmed by 1.0 C since the early 1800s. Given that we’ve just witnessed some of the worst coral bleaching in history and that we haven’t hit the 1.5 C mark yet, people are understandably worried. In this instance we definitely need to bridge the gap between science and policy—we need more scientists like Lough to stand up and say that a 2.0 C goal isn’t good enough, and we need policy makers who will listen and respond. There’s a piece missing to that though, and one that we can’t ignore. Local communities are the ones that depend on coral reefs and that will suffer the most if we lose our reefs. They aren’t the ones going to conferences like COP 21 though, and they aren’t always the ones conducting the scientific research. How do we make sure their voices are heard, and their resources are protected? How can we help these communities be strong and resilient in the face of these looming global shifts? We can do what we at CORAL do best—we can help them manage their natural resources. We can continue working in places like Fiji, where we’ve helped the Kubulau community autonomously manage the Namena Marine Reserve. We can continue supporting communities in Bali with their efforts building locally-managed marine protected areas (MPAs). We can continue working with our partners around the world to ensure communities benefit socially, financially and culturally from conservation. As numerous talks at ICRS have pointed out, strong management that effectively reduces local threats can buy corals the time they need to adapt to changing environmental conditions."

According to preliminary results from Dr. David Gill, many marine protected areas (MPAs) have inadequate staffing and financial resources for management activities and this could be affecting their ecological performance. Thankfully, at this year’s International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), we learned about various creative conservation financing mechanisms being developed and implemented around the world. Our favorite example is from   in Honduras (note: we may be a bit biased!). Jenny Myton, our Associate Programs Director for the Mesoamerican region, presented on their model this afternoon. In 2009 we helped RMP develop a business plan. From that plan, they’ve become 100% self-sustaining financially. They’ve created merchandise shops that bring in a third of their total revenue, and another third comes from the sale of voluntary dive tags. As you may have read in a previous blog post, in 2015 we gave RMP a $12,000 grant to hire a sustainable finance coordinator. They’ve since multiplied that amount astronomically, covering the costs of the position for the next several years as well as an expansion of marine park patrols to new areas. The example from RMP demonstrates that if we invest smartly and efficiently in building local management entities, we can help communities autonomously manage their resources in the long-term. Together, we can help empower communities to protect their coral reefs."

        "content": "In a natural landscape, trees and soil help soak up rainwater, but in developed or urban landscapes, rainwater falls onto streets, parking lots, roofs, or other non-absorbent surfaces like concrete and asphalt. Instead of sinking into the ground, rainwater runs off the land, picking up harmful pollutants like nutrients, pesticides, petroleum residues, and sediments along the way.  During heavy rains, the water that runs off the landscape is called stormwater. Eventually stormwater ends up in our oceans – either by traveling down storm drains or by flowing into waterways like rivers and streams that lead to the ocean. When polluted stormwater flows into the nearshore environment, it  . Nutrient pollution enables the overgrowth of algae which can kill corals by smothering them, blocking their access to sunlight and promoting coral disease. High levels of sediment runoff can also kill corals by suffocating them and blocking their access to sunlight. In Hawaiʻi, stormwater pollution is an island chain-wide problem. Because of our often steep topography and prevalence of altered landscapes (like concrete and deforested agricultural lands), most stormwater follows a quick path straight to the ocean. Large storm events in the islands can transfer so many pollutants into our coastal waters that the Department of Health has to issue “Brown Water Advisories” – warnings to the public that the water is potentially contaminated and poses a health threat to swimmers. A Brown Water Advisory is being issued for the island of Maui due to recent heavy rains. The public is advised to stay out of flood waters and storm water runoff due to possible overflowing cesspools, sewer manholes, pesticides, animal fecal matter, dead animals, pathogens, chemicals, and associated flood debris. Not all waters may be affected, however, if the water is brown stay out and continue to practice good personal hygiene. Follow up with your primary care physician if you have any health concerns.” Stormwater in Hawaiʻi not only poses a threat to coral reefs and human health but also negatively impacts the economy by causing a loss in revenue for the tourist industry. It causes a host of other environmental problems like polluting streams and denuding the land of important topsoil needed for agriculture. In West Maui, fallow agricultural lands and the design of dirt roads within these plantations has created easy pathways for sediment to travel to the ocean. Lack of ground cover, the slope of the land, and frequent heavy rains create perfect conditions to transport topsoil with all its contaminants down to coral reefs. In West Maui, CORAL’s   Initiative focuses on preventing sediment and nutrient pollution from reaching the ocean and degrading reefs.  We take a   (“ridge to reef”) approach to restore the natural function of a watershed to filter stormwater and absorb nutrients, sediments and other chemicals.  We work with farmers, Hawaiian communities, local nonprofits, private businesses, and the government to restore streams, which capture and stabilize sediments and nutrients so that they don’t flow into the ocean. We are piloting stream restoration techniques that combine modern technology with native vegetation and traditional Hawaiian agricultural practices. For example, we are planting deep-rooted vetiver grasses to help stabilize soil, absorb nutrients and pollutants, increase ground water infiltration, and improve the environment for successful replanting of native vegetation. When vetiver sediment traps are planted within dirt road “kickouts”, they can hold runoff from road segments, detaining water for long enough for sediments to soak into the soil, rather than flow into streams. These actions not only restore streams and prevent pollutants from entering the ocean, but they also lead to a whole host of benefits like restoring ecosystem services, improving habitat for species, and creating recreational opportunities for communities. If you live on Maui and are interested in playing a role in this important work,   You can help plant native plants, create sand bag corridors, and take part in other fun stream restoration activities! For more details, email Annalea Fink at maui@coral.org. You can also help reduce stormwater pollution and safeguard coral reefs year-round by reducing pesticide and chemical use in your yard, and/or by implementing low impact design (LID) solutions like   or   in your home or workplace.

One of the key findings of the HRI Report Card is that the long-term dedication and collaboration of groups like CORAL in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) has paid off, leading to direct and measurable improvements in reef health. Despite the fact that corals worldwide were hard-hit by mass bleaching over the last few years, 10 years of reef monitoring by HRI – from over 300 sites across 1000 kilometers and four countries – tells us that things are looking up in the MAR. The positive trend is attributed to   and a significant  , which now cover 57% of the MAR. Legal protection and local management actions like no-fishing zones can lead to a measurable and positive shift in the number and size of fish. And when herbivorous fishes (like parrotfish and surgeonfish) thrive, coral reefs benefit because these fishes intensively feed on harmful seaweeds that outcompete and can overtake corals. The   are encouraging for two reasons: First, it tells us that there are indeed straightforward and concrete actions we can take to help corals adapt to the immediate challenges in their environment. Second, it tells us that the strategies that CORAL has been employing in our twelve years of engagement in the MAR are exactly the right things to be doing.  . For over 15 years, we have been working in West End, supporting and building the capacity of Roatán Marine Park (RMP), our long-time partners and co-managers of the Bay Islands National Marine Park. Nowhere is the success of our approach more evident than in the recent declaration of the Tela Bay Marine Wildlife Refuge. Thanks to the hard work of CORAL and partners, in early 2018 the Honduran national government approved the declaration of this new marine protected area, which covers 86,259 hectares of reefs and coastal ocean. Hiding in Tela Bay’s unassuming murky waters are some of the healthiest coral reefs in all of the Caribbean. Scientific surveys have shown that Tela Bay supports a staggering sixty-nine percent of live coral cover, which is more than three times the average coral cover in the Caribbean. The bay supports forty-six coral species, eighty-three fish species and eighteen types of marine habitats. It is also home to healthy populations of elkhorn and staghorn coral – a rare distinction given that these critically endangered species have declined by eighty percent over the past thirty years. The refuge will not only ensure the future of this stunning ecosystem, it will also enable the coral reefs to continue to provide food and economic opportunities to the thirteen coastal communities that live on its shores. As part of our efforts to protect the unique reefs of Tela Bay, CORAL also played a key role in the declaration of Honduras’ first coastal managed-access fishery in   – a lagoon near Tela Bay where juvenile reef fishes grow up.  This managed-access fishery creates an important model for fisheries reform in the southern MAR. We’re continuing our work with local partners to ensure protection of this marine treasure through projects that create win-wins for people and reefs, such as supporting alternative livelihoods to reduce unsustainable fishing in Tela Bay and the neighboring  Amid the often gloomy messages about the fate of coral reefs, we feel it’s important to acknowledge and celebrate the hard-earned conservation successes by dedicated communities of people who care deeply about the future of reefs – from non-profits and the dive community to governments and local fishing communities. We look forward to seeing what more we can accomplish together! En enero de 2018, compartimos los resultados del informe de Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI, La Iniciativa de Arrecifes Saludables, por sus siglas en inglés) sobre el estado y las tendencias de la salud de los arrecifes en el Arrecife Mesoamericano (SAM). Uno de los hallazgos clave del Reporte de HRI es que la dedicación y colaboración a largo plazo de grupos como CORAL en el Arrecife Mesoamericano (SAM) ha dado sus frutos, lo que ha llevado a mejoras directas y medibles en la salud del arrecife. A pesar de que los corales de todo el mundo se vieron muy afectados por el blanqueamiento masivo en los últimos años, 10 años de monitoreo de arrecifes por parte de HRI, en más de 300 sitios a lo largo de 1000 kilómetros y cuatro países, nos dicen que las cosas están mejorando en el SAM. La tendencia positiva se atribuye a un   y un aumento significativo de las , que ahora cubren el 57% del SAM. La protección legal y las acciones de gestión local, como las zonas prohibidas para la pesca, pueden conducir a un cambio medible y positivo en el número y tamaño de los peces. Y cuando los peces herbívoros (como el pez loro y el pez cirujano) prosperan, los arrecifes de coral se benefician porque estos peces se alimentan intensamente de algas marinas dañinas que compiten y pueden sobrepasar a los corales. Los   son alentadores por dos razones: primero, nos dice que hay acciones sencillas y concretas que podemos tomar para ayudar a los corales a adaptarse a los desafíos inmediatos en su entorno. En segundo lugar, nos dice que las estrategias que CORAL ha estado implementando en nuestros doce años de participación en el SAM son exactamente lo que hay que hacer.  . Llevamos más de 15 años trabajando en West End, apoyando y reforzando la capacidad del Parque Marino de Roatán (RMP), nuestros aliados de siempre y cogestores del Parque Nacional Marino de las Islas de la Bahía. En ninguna parte es más evidente el éxito de nuestro enfoque que en la reciente declaración del Refugio de Vida Silvestre Marina de la Bahía de Tela. Gracias al arduo trabajo de CORAL y sus aliados, a principios de 2018 el gobierno nacional hondureño aprobó la declaración de esta nueva área marina protegida, que abarca 86,259 hectáreas de arrecifes y océano costero. Escondidos en las modestas aguas turbias de la Bahía de Tela se encuentran algunos de los arrecifes de coral más saludables de todo el Caribe. Las investigaciones científicas han demostrado que la Bahía de Tela mantiene un asombroso sesenta y nueve por ciento de cobertura de coral vivo, lo que supone más de tres veces la cobertura media de coral en el Caribe. La bahía alberga cuarenta y seis especies de coral, ochenta y tres especies de peces y dieciocho tipos de hábitats marinos. También alberga poblaciones sanas de coral cuerno de alce y cuerno de ciervo, una distinción poco común dado que estas especies, en peligro crítico de extinción, han disminuido un ochenta por ciento en los últimos treinta años. El refugio no sólo garantizará el futuro de este impresionante ecosistema, sino que también permitirá que los arrecifes de coral sigan proporcionando alimentos y oportunidades económicas a las trece comunidades costeras que viven en sus orillas. Como parte de nuestros esfuerzos para proteger los arrecifes únicos de la Bahía de Tela, CORAL también desempeñó un papel clave en la declaración de la primera pesquería costera de acceso controlado en la  , una laguna cercana a la Bahía de Tela donde crecen los peces juveniles de los arrecifes. Esta pesquería de acceso controlado crea un modelo importante para la reforma pesquera en el sur del SAM. Seguimos trabajando con colaboradores locales para garantizar la protección de este tesoro marino a través de proyectos en los que la gente y los arrecifes salen ganando, como el apoyo a medios de vida alternativos para reducir la pesca insostenible en la bahía de Tela y la adyacente  A pesar de los mensajes a menudo desalentadores sobre el destino de los arrecifes de coral, creemos que es importante reconocer y celebrar los éxitos en materia de conservación conseguidos con mucho esfuerzo por comunidades de personas dedicadas que se preocupan profundamente por el futuro de los arrecifes, desde las organizaciones sin ánimo de lucro y la comunidad de buceadores hasta los gobiernos y las comunidades pesqueras locales. ¡Con gran expectativa esperamos ver qué más podemos lograr juntos!"

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented economic crisis across the globe—particularly in countries and regions that are highly dependent upon tourism revenue. In Honduras, for example, eight percent of the GDP comes from tourism. Spring break is one of their most popular travel periods when tourists from around the world flock to the Bay Islands on the Honduran Caribbean coast. The Bay Islands are a launching point to the world’s second-largest reef system—the Mesoamerican Reef—and the beautiful white sand beaches attract vacationers from around the globe. But this year, Easter week alone saw a loss of $283.4 million USD and nearly 30,000 jobs. The local communities who depend on that revenue and income felt the effects acutely. CORAL has partnered with local Bay Island communities since 2005 to build programs that reduce the impact of tourism on the reef and to ensure proceeds from tourism benefit communities and the environment. But perhaps even more importantly, we’ve helped the communities build programs that allow them to become resilient to setbacks, including COVID-19. When tourism suddenly came to an abrupt halt, CORAL and its local partners immediately got to work. We united with Go Blue Bay Islands and various tourism industry and government representatives to create a local committee that could help the region safely reopen its tourism economy. The popular committee soon expanded into a national committee and began addressing tourism safety across the country. Together the team created The Tourism Revitalization Plan*, which outlines biosecurity guidelines and best practices that provide a framework for restarting tourism responsibly and safely. “One of the greatest values of these guidelines is that they come from a joint approach that promotes inclusivity and applicability,” says Ms. Syntia Solomon, President of the Bay Islands Tourism Bureau and one of the founders of Go Blue Bay Islands. “Our destination and businesses must reopen, and we must restart domestic and international tourism responsibly and safely. To achieve this, all cross-sector businesses, regardless of size, must put in clear, sustainable and practical protocols.” The document has outlined protocols for businesses across sectors, like hotels, restaurants, tour operators, dive centers, rental car companies, beaches, gift shops and more. Some of the protocols are fairly familiar—like ensuring ease of access to hand-washing stations, requiring face masks, and encouraging social distancing. Others focus on ensuring employees and tourism operators are trained to recognize and address risks. And some outline clear response procedures for when an employee or community member tests positive. Just like coral reefs, when human communities are able to shift and adapt in times of crisis, they can stand strong—and even thrive—when faced with shocks and stresses. By listening to our local partners and acting based on their feedback, and by ensuring local communities have a united voice and the resources they need to weather periods of uncertainty, we can help the Bay Islands bounce back and reopen safely. “One of the most incredible things about the Bay Islands is our proximity the Mesoamerican Reef,” says Tanya Amaya, CORAL’s Program Manager in the Bay Islands. “Our economy is built around people coming from across the globe to experience its magic and enjoy our beautiful beaches. We’re hopeful that with these new protocols, we’ll be able to reopen the economy safely and begin welcoming visitors again.”  "

        "content": "As Executive Director of the Roatán Marine Park, Francis Lean can relate to her tourist clientele—she used to be one of them. Originally from Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, Lean used to join the 1.6 million people who visited Roatán on vacation each year. Roatán is one of the three main islands that make up the Bay Island chain on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. Its economy is highly dependent upon tourism, and travelers from around the world flock to the island to enjoy its beautiful white sand beaches and turquoise waters. The Roatán Marine Park (RMP) is one of 14 organizations that are responsible for day-to-day management of the resources within the Bay Islands National Marine Park, the largest marine protected area in Honduras. Like many businesses and organizations on the island, RMP is almost entirely reliant upon tourism—85% of its operating budget is tied to tourism, both directly and indirectly. So when COVID-19 led to widespread global lockdowns and a sudden halt in tourism, it hit the community and RMP like a ton of bricks. Overnight, their revenue plummeted. Their four gift shops, which typically account for nearly half of their revenue, no longer had any customers. Donations from tourists stopped coming. Hotels, restaurants and dive shops halted their sponsorships as they struggled to cover their own expenses. “We couldn’t believe it. It was very scary,” describes Lean. “Personally, I was very positive, thinking it would be over in a few days or a couple of weeks. But after a couple of weeks, I realized that we were going to have to make some tough decisions and prioritize.” The RMP team decided that maintaining their patrols was their top priority. “With everything that was happening, people were going to head to the ocean to get food,” says Lean. “We needed to make sure they did it sustainably.” As predicted, from April to June RMP saw a 150% increase in poaching compared to the same period last year. But paying for patrols meant they had to make cuts elsewhere. The non-patrol staff agreed to cut their hours and their salaries by 50%, and they closed all but one of their gift shops. Despite the hardships, Lean says RMP has been fairly resilient overall. She attributes much of that resilience to the relationships and collaborations they have in the community, which, she says, is largely a result of the support they have received from CORAL over the years. She highlighted their partnership with the Honduran Navy as an example, something CORAL helped establish. Every RMP patrol boat carries two members of the Navy to help with enforcement and safety. With five patrol boats, that’s at least ten Navy members per day. Typically, her staff would drive to another part of the island to pick up the Navy members from their base and bring them to the park office before each patrol. But with resources and time now a scarce commodity, community members have stepped up to house and feed Navy members locally and donate fuel for the patrol boats. RMP staff members also have taken to digital fundraising and marketing efforts. “We’re going digital,” says Lean. “We opened up a store online so now we can sell our products online, and we’re doing online fundraising also.” And with CORAL’s help, they have received a few grants to help cover some of their operating costs. CORAL has also created the Honduras COVID Reef Rescue Fund to solicit donations for RMP. Slowly, tourists are starting to return to the island. “People are feeling more positive now,” says Lean. “People are starting to work again and some of the dive shops are starting to get a small trickle of customers.” Looking forward, Lean knows they will be feeling the impacts of this downturn for years to come. But she’s confident in the organization’s ability to adapt and sees these past few months as an opportunity for the community and local businesses to reassess and reevaluate how they operate. At RMP, they are brainstorming new ways to diversify their revenue stream and are looking to secure more grant funding to make that happen. In the meantime, Lean encourages people to start following the Roatán Marine Park on social media and visit Roatán again. “The island is here waiting for you guys to come see it and take care of it,” pitches Lean. “This is the time to come to Roatán—the reef has taken a break from people, and that’s a good thing.”"

        "content": "Local scientists from CORAL and the   made an exciting, new discovery during this year’s coral reef monitoring in Trujillo, Honduras. With the help of nearby fishers, they found multiple sites of new coral reefs that have not previously been monitored or studied by the local scientific community. For a while, local scientists suspected there were new reefs, but were unable to find them due to bad weather and other complications. “This is great news and we’re hoping it is just the tip of the iceberg,” says CORAL Conservation Program Director Jenny Myton. “It’s possible that there are even more reefs nearby.”  Trujillo’s newfound reefs are functional and have an estimated 12 to 16 percent live coral cover, compared to Trujillo’s average cover of just nine percent. If properly protected, new reefs in Trujillo may be beneficial for the entire Mesoamerican reef region.   According to HRI scientist Ian Drysdale, Trujillo’s new reefs are considered a “sister” to the reefs in Tela Bay, which are more than 100 kilometers away. This is because the dominant type of coral on the reefs is the same, as are many of the surrounding fish and wildlife. Studies show that fish connectivity between the two regions is high, with some scientists hypothesizing that Trujillo actually is a source of fish larvae for all of Honduras.   In fact, there is connectivity between coral reefs in many parts of Mesoamerica due to ocean currents. While  , reef-building corals release male and female reproductive cells known as gametes, which join together to form baby coral. The offspring then ride the current for up to three weeks before eventually attaching to a hard surface to grow.  “Marine currents can be very strong,” says Drysdale. “When massive spawning events happen [in Mesoamerica], it is in the rainy season with high winds, storms, and currents. This can send offspring farther away, versus when we have flat, calm seas.”  By discovering, monitoring, and protecting new reefs, like the ones found in Trujillo, we will also protect corals found in other parts of the ocean. With this knowledge in mind, CORAL works to establish healthy coral reef networks throughout Mesoamerica, thus protecting vital coral species, coastal communities, and surrounding wildlife.  When examining the Trujillo reefs, both Drysdale and CORAL Program Coordinator Paolo Guardiola noticed a lack of fish and physical evidence of reef damage, which point to signs of overfishing.  “We saw anchor scars,” says Drysdale, discussing the devastating damage found on an entire row of barrel sponges amongst the reef. “An anchor went right across [the sponges] and the scar was more than a meter wide and 15 meters long.” When protecting a network of sister reefs, it is important to address the direct threats facing each area. By minimizing overfishing and irresponsible practices in Trujillo, we will also improve the health of reefs in other locations.  That’s why CORAL turns directly to the local community in Honduras, working side by side with community scientists and local fishers to secure healthy fish populations for different reefs in the region.  “For about two and a half years, we’ve been collecting data to build a fisheries management plan,” says Guardiola. “If we protect reefs in Trujillo, we’ll also improve the local economy. Fishers will be able to collect larger fish and at higher quantities.” This ongoing data is shared with key stakeholders, like NGOS, local governments, and fishing communities, in order to create awareness and promote sustainable fishing practices that protect coral reefs.  As we continue to learn about Trujillo’s new coral reefs and the threats they face, our team, local scientists, and members of the community can continue to evolve practices and push for new protection measures—so coral reefs in Mesoamerica can continue to thrive for generations to come.  "

This June, many of the world’s top coral reef scientists met at the International Coral Reef Symposium in Hawaii to discuss the challenges facing coral reefs. Sunscreen and other personal care product ingredients were hot topics. Of particular concern to scientists was oxybenzone, a chemical used in sunscreens to protect our skin from damaging UV light. Oxybenzone is bad news for corals, harming them by; Perhaps most alarming is that all of this can happen with very low doses of the chemical, only 62 parts per trillion (equivalent to one drop of water in 6.5 Olympic swimming pools)! Sunscreen can enter the water directly from our bodies while swimming, or it can wash off the sand at the beach. Spray-on sunscreens especially create a chemical cloud that often misses the skin and settles on the sand. As the tide comes in, all these chemicals wash into the ocean;   found higher oxybenzone concentrations in the ocean at high tide than low tide.

I would love to say that ICRS filled me with a sense of optimism about the state of reefs. However, the truth is that corals face a dire future unless we act now at both global and local scales. At a global scale, rising carbon dioxide levels are heating our planet. The recent El Niño, along with elevated temperatures, is causing widespread and devastating bleaching around the world. Dr. David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park Authority, shared how much of the GBR has been impacted by cyclones over the past decade. Recently, unusually warm water bathed the untouched northern part of the GBR, causing severe bleaching of  . At a local level, ICRS dedicated several sessions to the impacts of poor water quality on reefs, highlighting the important connections between land and sea. Other talks focused on the roles of herbivores in combating algae, and how over-fishing has reduced herbivore populations in many areas. Fortunately, amongst the bad news, there were some things that gave me hope. I felt a palpable sense of urgency at ICRS. Rather than being another scientific conference at which to learn about cool but esoteric research, this meeting actively sought to apply new knowledge to conserving coral reefs. To me, this underscores the importance of the work we are doing at CORAL to unite communities to save coral reefs. We can create the conditions for corals to survive climate change by building strong and effective management systems in which local people have the capacity and financial support for management. It’s also clear that this alone won’t be enough: humans need to drastically reduce emissions. I’m hopeful that the recent COP21 agreement ratified in Paris will create incentives for governments to act. It’s clear that time is running out for reefs and many other ecosystems: we need to act now if we want future generations to experience the wonder of coral reefs."

Did you know that some of the 129 species of butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae) are “mucus munchers?” As strange as it might sound, some butterflyfish take advantage of energy-rich coral mucus as a primary food source. Corals produce mucus as a protective layer or use its stickiness to trap food.  Butterflyfish feed on this nutrient rich layer and take advantage of this easy to consume food source. Other butterflyfish species feed on coral polyps or small invertebrates and plankton. Butterflyfish are fairly small and laterally flattened – they look like a disc with rounded fins. They are found around the world on coral reefs and are brightly colored, often with some combination of yellow, black and white. Many butterflyfish species are monogamous and territorial. You will often see a pair swimming together on a reef, although some species roam farther and in larger groups. They are active in the daytime and hide in crevices at night to avoid predators. When butterflyfish reproduce, they release buoyant eggs that float with plankton that once hatched, go through a larval stage where the tiny fish have plate-like armor, before growing into miniature adults. Next time you visit a reef, keep an eye out for these beautiful reef fish and see how many species you can identify."

One of the greatest rewards is meeting and working with such diverse groups of people and building strong connections with the communities in Fiji. Following Tropical Cyclone Winston, l discovered just how passionately connected to the Kubulau community I had become. I wanted to do more to help, and in July, I had an amazing opportunity to connect on a much larger scale at the inaugural Melanesian Spearhead Group, Emerging Leaders Program. Here, I learned about new ways to help community’s recovery from devastation and hardships caused by such a catastrophic storm. During the Melanesian Youth Leaders Forum, I met people from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji. We all shared our successes and challenges and along the way, we gathered valuable and shareable lessons. We were welcomed by the President of Vanuatu the Honorable Baldwin Jacobson Lonsdale in a traditional welcoming ceremony. The four-day program was in two broad parts: presentations by different organizations in the morning and traveling to field sites to see how the work is carried out in different parts of Efate. The most inspiring session was with the Minister for Lands, the Honorable Ralph Regenvanu. He spoke eloquently about his experiences growing up in the midst of Vanuatu fighting (to gain independence), and how they shaped and influenced his decisions. He realized early the importance of culture and traditions and that led him to study anthropology. When he saw that the work he was doing was being undermined by the way land issues were being handled, he returned to school to study law and then went into politics because the only way he felt he could make real changes was from the inside. The biggest takeaway emerged from the afternoon field site visits and the work being done by Wan Smol Bag, Activ, and Lapita. These three companies have managed to continue to work despite the challenges faced during and post-Tropical Cyclone Pam. Compared to Fiji’s recent Tropical Cyclone Winston, there are many similarities in the adversity they faced and how they are working on recovery. Activ is a company that sells local handicrafts and teaches those in the community how to make quality goods. Lapita is a bakery, owned by an indigenous local, who sources products within the community. Visiting these businesses, I immediately imagined how we could replicate these ideas in Fiji. These local practices perfectly pair with CORAL’s conservation work to create and support marine protected areas in an effort to create alternative livelihoods and lessen the reliance on coral reef resources. A unique lesson I learned is how theater and arts are used to share messages, or even provide meaningful alternative activities for young people. At present, much of the recovery effort has focused on basic necessities such as delivery of food, water, and rebuilding materials. Moving forward there is an opportunity to provide more support for emotional and psychological support for victims of Tropical Cyclone Winston. In Vanuatu, I saw the positive impacts that theater and arts played in helping communities cope with trauma. A lesson I can take back to Fiji. This forum is a powerful example of what can happen when you unite people from various communities from around the globe. I left the forum with new friends and ideas about how to help Fiji communities continue to recover from disaster. I look forward to sharing this knowledge with CORAL and the communities at the forefront of local conservation efforts here in Fiji."

While there, I was invited to visit some coral reefs off the West coast of Sulawesi. It was rumored that some areas had 100 percent live coral cover, so I jumped at the chance to go and see for myself. Before I tell you what I saw in the water, I need to explain just how skeptical I was of the reported health of those reefs. I have completed more than 1,000 coral surveys in the past few years with Reef Check Australia and other research groups. In my experience, when people say a reef has 100 percent live coral cover it is usually closer to 70 percent. So, it was with some skepticism that I headed off to Sulawesi take a closer look. To get to the dive site I took a 30-minute boat ride from the city of Makassar in Southwest Sulawesi to Pulau Badi. The area off Makassar is heavily fished, using both cyanide and bombs, so I was not sure what I would find when I jumped into the water. What greeted me was amazing. There truly was 100 percent live coral cover. I hadn’t seen reefs like this ever before. They were beautiful—not many fish, but so much coral diversity. Moreover, I didn’t see any signs of bleaching, the global bleaching event of the last few years seemed to have left these corals untouched. What I found most interesting is that these healthy patches of coral were next to areas that had been bombed for fishing. These areas were not recovering due to unstable coral rubble being swept around in the currents. A group of us went to visit Pulau Badi to see how Mars Symbioscience is investing in restoring these damaged sections of reef. We hope to learn how some of these strategies might be applied to reefs in Bali. Ultimately, it is a relief to know that places like this still exist; that there are bright spots where corals are adapting and thriving, despite warming waters and the pressure of human activities. I got back on the boat a bit more inspired and determined to work ever more diligently to protect special places like this, and to reduce threats in places where coral health is poor. It is a reminder that corals can survive and adapt to a rapidly changing world. As humans, we just need to make sure that we are doing all that we can to support healthy reefs. This is an area of the reef that is damaged from bomb fishing.     Pak Eka from Les Village snorkels in Pulau Badi and learns how Mars Symbioscience is stabilizing and restoring coral reef damaged by bomb fishing.   Here is an area on the same reef with healthy coral cover.

I’m sitting around a kava bowl with community elders, and we are discussing how to protect and conserve their marine resources. You see, this community depends on coral reefs, but the reefs are facing mounting threats. The elders are concerned: they want to ensure there are fish in the sea for their grandchildren and great grandchildren. I am here, in Fiji, as part of my work with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), and at the request of communities who have asked us to help them create effective and durable approaches to coral conservation. I am here to help save coral reefs. CORAL has worked in Fiji for the past 15 years. We’ve worked closely with the resource management committee in the Kubulau district—also known as the KRMC. The Kubulau community has traditional ownership of the Namena Marine Reserve—one of the largest   (no take) areas in Fiji. Through training and micro-grants, we have helped the KRMC increase its management capacity, including establishing a voluntary fee program for visitors. In 2015, the community raised more than $20,000 to support the Namena Marine Reserve, community infrastructure projects and scholarship programs that have benefitted more than 170 students. Over the last decade, we have seen the community’s capacity and autonomy grow. This was proven in February during the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Winston—a category 5 storm that passed directly over Kubulau. Following the storm, KRMC had the resources they needed to start the recovery process without opening their   area to fishing. By not using their marine resources, the community is helping the reef recover from the storm. (You can read more about KRMC’s post-Winston efforts  .) CORAL continues to play an important role in Kubulau and we have been pursuing ways to share our knowledge with other communities. This work bolsters efforts by the Fijian government to include 30 percent of its ocean in marine protected areas (MPAs) by 2020. Our work has paid off. We are thrilled to announce that thanks to a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of State we will expand our work to Cakaudrove, Ra and Lau provinces. In fact, we’ve already begun, and during my recent visit, I met with elders and community members from these provinces. What I learned is that each community approaches conservation in a different way. There is a unique opportunity in  . The elders are working with the government to launch a new nearshore management zoning pilot project. The project will identify different use zones in the marine environment such as fishing,  , and tourism. If successful, this approach could be rolled out to other communities across the country. is situated across the Bligh Passage from Namena Marine Reserve and many of its communities were hit hard by tropical cyclone Winston. In Ra, a number of governmental and non-governmental initiatives are underway to help improve management of marine protected areas. Oneta is 200 miles across open ocean from Fiji’s capital Suva. Part of the   province, this island is less than three miles long and is surrounded by an atoll of reefs. Conservation in Lau is more localized; many communities have established   areas through traditional agreements and with little outside support. The community on Oneata reached out to Fiji’s Provincial Conservation Officer from the iTaukei Affairs Board for help. They connected the community to CORAL. Together with partners, we will help these communities strengthen their approaches to conservation. Through training in topics like fisheries enforcement and financial administration, we will build the capacity of local communities to effectively manage their resources. We will use what we’ve learned from our work in Kubulau as the basis for building a network of effectively managed areas in Fiji. I look forward to my next visit to Fiji, to sitting down with community leaders to drink kava and talk about how we can save reefs. We look forward to once again sharing what we learn so that our collective successes can guide and shape conservation work across the entire region. We can save coral reefs for the children of today and tomorrow."

        "content": "It was early Sunday morning, in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Winston. No one knew the full extent of the damage it had left behind. Scattered reports were coming through the little transistor radio my mum kept for emergencies, and for the days and weeks that followed, it would prove to be an incredibly valuable device. My first instinct was to check on our partners and friends in Kubulau— they were in the direct path of the Category 5 cyclone. There was absolutely no way to reach them. The communication towers for both phone networks in Fiji were down. As reports started coming in from other communities and the devastation they faced, I began to worry. Did Kubulau make it? What had they lost? What did this mean for the Namena Marine Reserve and their pristine coral reefs? CORAL is closely tied with the people and districts within Kubulau. Since 2005, we have helped develop and create an effective and sustainable community group that manages the district’s natural marine resources, the Kubulau Resource Management Committee (KRMC). As I was about to discover, the KRMC proved its worth in the wake of Winston—not only to the people of Kubulau, but also to the reefs within the Namena Marine Reserve. Early Tuesday morning, when the cell towers were restored, I received a call from Peni Were, the coordinator for the KRMC. I was apprehensive about taking it—what could I say to someone who had potentially lost everything in the strongest cyclone to hit this side of the planet? My anxiety was quickly allayed by the decisiveness of our conversation. He spoke quickly through their harrowing experience. When I asked what they needed he sounded like he was reading off a list; pinch bars, hammers, cutters, and most urgent of all, chainsaws. He said, “Right after the cyclone, the KRMC organized all able-bodied men to begin clearing fallen trees on the roads and in the villages. In the last 24 hours, we’ve reached all accessible villages except three and have collected figures on the extent of damages.” In just three days, while most other communities in Fiji were still in crisis mode, this district had proactively begun their rehabilitation without outside assistance. As assessments conducted by the government’s Disaster Management Center indicated, the Kubulau district was one of the worst hit in Vanua Levu with more than 80 percent of houses destroyed. The quick recovery process is a result of their strong communal, traditional and familial ties. These attributes transferred to the KRMC and together, they were able to respond and fund their immediate recovery needs. Kubulau suffered great losses to their iqoliqoli (traditional fishing grounds). The local fishermen had two accessible iqoliqoli, and after Winston, one of them was completely destroyed; it was all sand. Despite this, they did not have to open up their tabus (restricted fishing areas). The reef fees they collect go into a community fund and savings account. This means the communities of Kubulau had the financial resources they needed to get by and make up for lost fishing and tourism incomes. As I was about to hang up, Peni told me that Paulo Kolikata, the recipient of the 2015 CORAL Conservation Prize, wanted to speak with me. The first thing he said was, “Isa Lisi, na nodatou vale sa yali” which means “Isa Lisi, our home is gone.” It hit me hard. In the iTaukei language, to say nodatou was to include me as a member of his home. We shared the loss. I choked back on tears as I thought of the lovely pale yellow concrete home that had billeted me just two weeks earlier. I returned to Kubulau three weeks after Winston. It was difficult, but I did not openly cry when I saw the destruction—it served no purpose; it would not bring back what was lost. What I could do was become an amplifier, to take the data and stories I had gathered and find ways to give back. Even though the state of their environment was dire, and the pain and grief of those affected could be heard under their cheery voices, what stood out most prominently was their resilience and their determination to move on, rebuild and grow. To note: Together, we grieved and supported our partners and friends in Kubulau. Thanks to CORAL’s generous supporters, we were able to send the KRMC more than $5,000 to buy chainsaws, gasoline and other much-needed equipment and tools."

Research conducted on Palmyra Atoll by members of the   found that pristine coral reefs dampen much more wave energy than expected. In other words, healthy reefs are better at protecting coastlines from wave and storm damage. Conversely, a reef that is not as healthy (perhaps due to poor water quality or overfishing) is less able to absorb or dissipate wave energy. This creates a negative feedback loop: less healthy reefs take more of a beating which leads to—you guessed it!—even less healthy reefs. Over time, this can cause previously protected coastlines to become more susceptible to wave and storm damage.

Soft corals, in particular, have been found to possess compounds that could be used to treat various types of cancers.

Researchers isolated these steroids from soft corals and performed various experiments on human cytomegalovirus, mouse lymphocytic leukemia, human colon adenocarcinoma and human lung carcinoma. Their successful experiments have paved the way for continued experimentation on how soft corals can be used to life saving drugs.

Dive tourism, fishing and farming are the lifeblood of Tulamben and Amed, and there is a deep concern about the health and management of local coral reefs. Because of these concerns, we have been working with our partners in these and other villages along the north coast of Bali to establish a network of well-managed marine protected areas that are ecologically connected and socioeconomically sustainable. Effectively managing this network requires the support of local communities. To garner this support, community concerns and knowledge must be understood and incorporated into management plans. To build an effective management plan, we partnered with Lens of the Community of Indonesia and asked villagers to use photos to document their natural environments, cultures, traditions and lifestyles. The photos tell powerful stories about how community members interact with nature and can identify issues and challenges that may affect management priorities. In both Tulamben and Amed, the photos identified sedimentation, trash and tourism activities as major threats to reefs. This was the first time community members had an opportunity to voice their concerns and their vision of their future and the future of their reefs. These photos can be used to build management plans and help governments and local NGOs better prioritize conservation initiatives. We are hoping to expand this project to other parts of Bali and create community-driven and community-supported marine protected areas.

Five hundred million people around the world depend on reef fish and other animals for food and income. In addition to providing a significant source of protein for up to a billion people, coral reef fish support commercial and artisanal fisheries and serve as a key tourist attraction. By one estimate, the coral reef global fishing and tourism industries are worth four hundred billion dollars each year. Many fish populations around the world, however, are overfished. Overfishing can harm reef ecosystems by removing fish that perform essential functions—for example, when too many herbivorous fish are harvested, reefs become overgrown with macroalgae (seaweed). Overfishing can also harm the communities that depend on reefs for income. Groupers are one type of fish that can be sold for a high value and given such, many species of groupers are overfished. Groupers naturally come together to spawn and such a fish aggregation can be very easy to harvest. Creating well-managed local fisheries helps fish populations like the grouper to recover after harvesting events and ensures that local communities can earn income over the long term. One way we work to create more sustainable fisheries is by the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), which are locations in which some (or all) types of fishing are banned. Over time and within an MPA, fish populations are able to increase and some fish will inevitably move out of the restricted area. In addition, fish within the MPA grow older and larger—they become “ ” (which actually is a real term used among researches that stands for “big old fat fecund female fishes), which produce more and better young. In these two ways, MPAs can help fish populations increase outside the MPA. Realizing the benefits of an MPA, however, requires that the MPA is effectively managed—that there are adequate staff to enforce regulations and they have the financial resources to support management activities.

In fact, RMP has been so successful at harnessing their fundraising potential that they have expanded their activities to include educational programs for local schools, an extensive marine infrastructure program and designing and implementing tourist education programs.

Sharks are commonly misunderstood and widely feared. These remarkable animals, however, are valuable to the tourism industry and the economic health of coral reef destinations. A   from the Australian Institute of Marine Science found that shark tourism accounts for approximately eight percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the island nation of Palau. The study showed that the roughly 100 sharks inhabiting the most popular dive sites in the area were each worth $179,000 annually to the local tourism industry, giving each shark an approximate lifetime value of $1.9 million. Worldwide, established shark-related diving operations can be found in at least 83 locations in 29 different countries. However, shark populations are declining at an alarming rate. Approximately 30 percent of shark species are threatened or nearly threatened with extinction, and the status of another roughly 50 percent is unclear due to insufficient data. Intense commercial fishing is largely to blame for the decline, and shark finning, the practice of removing a shark’s fins and discarding the rest of the animal to die at sea, is particularly rampant. This practice is driven by demand for shark fin soup, a delicacy that creates a lucrative market for shark fins. Because most sharks reproduce late in life and bear few offspring, scientists fear that some severely depleted populations may take hundreds of years to rebuild. This frightening prospect has compelled conservationists, scientists and government officials to push for greater shark protection. Recently,   and the Maldives have created shark sanctuaries by prohibiting commercial shark fishing in their countries’ exclusive economic zones.   also implemented a shark fishing moratorium, and   has now instituted a retention ban aimed at banning the possession of shark fins in state waters.   recently signed a shark and ray sanctuary into law. Lastly, in  , we have worked with our partners to get better protection for sharks through wide-reaching media and education campaigns. These initiatives will educate communities about their vested stake in preserving healthy shark populations to support the coral reef ecosystems that provide them with food, income and coastal protection. Additional shark sanctuaries and conservation policies are gaining momentum around the world.

        "content": "The facts are clear: our world is getting warmer, and the warming is happening rapidly. For plants, animals and other organisms, shifts in climate have enormous consequences. Nowhere is this more true than on coral reefs, where a worldwide crisis is underway that has scientists and environmentalists asking a chilling question: how can we save coral reefs? At the Coral Reef Alliance, we believe that the natural process of adaptation can help save coral reefs. A   co-authored by CORAL staff and others, argues that adaptation will occur faster and have a better chance of succeeding if nature has many options with which to work. Options take the form of different species, individuals and genes and work like tickets in a lottery: most are not winners, but a few have just the right combinations to succeed. This article outlines an innovative approach and practical advice about how we can facilitate the processes of adaptation through the creation of adaptation networks, which maximize the probability of nature finding the winners. Adaptation networks have three attributes. They are: Adaptation networks serve as experimental testing grounds where billions of evolutionary match/mismatch tests (lottery draws) allow nature to pick winning combinations of genes and species. As our climate continues to change, these winners are vital to creating the ecosystems of the future in which humans and other species can continue to thrive. This approach to the creation of adaptation networks is a direct contrast to many contemporary conservation strategies that are based on forecasting which species will succeed under future environmental conditions. However, it is notoriously difficult to predict the effects of climate change on local environments accurately, and even harder to predict which organisms will succeed in these anticipated conditions. In the face of this uncertainty, it is unwise only to protect those species or areas that we think will survive in the oceans of the future. It is for this reason that adaptation networks could prove to be the best method to save coral reefs by protecting diversity and allowing the natural selection process to happen."

Located at the base of Mount Agung in the North East of Bali, Tulamben is one of the driest places on the island.

Recently, the   arranged a community cleanup to remove inorganic trash from the river mouth at the  . The cleanup was officially opened by the head of Tulamben Village, Nyoman Ardika, and had over 60 divers participate, including local divers from Tulamben, tourists, nongovernmental organizations, representatives of the East Buleleng community, and Nyoman Musna, a member of parliament from the Karangasem Regency. After the cleanup had ended, about 120 kilos of inorganic trash were from a depth of 17 to 20 meters underwater. This community effort will help reduce the stresses placed on the local marine life by human activities such as tourism. Though it’s great to see a large turnout from the community for this cleanup, it shouldn’t be necessary to maintain this global treasure. In honor of Earth Day, you can do your part: consider making a lifetime pledge to not litter and to help clean up trash when you see it. If you’re out for a walk at your local park, pick up that soda bottle and recycle it instead of leaving it for the next person. If you’re on vacation and snorkeling or diving on the local reef, keep your trash in a safe place and properly dispose of it when you return to the shore. Inorganic waste is a human problem and therefore can be solved by humans. Only together can we help create clean water for people, reefs and our home, planet Earth."

It turns out that there may be a Goldilocks solution that’s not too big and not too small. Adaptive Reefscapes should be as big as possible to reduce problems caused by large disturbances; a small Reefscape might be at risk from one major hurricane or bleaching event, but a large Reefscape is more likely to include some reefs that are unharmed and can be sources of future recolonization. Large Reefscapes are also more likely to include lots of different kinds of reefs and corals. This diversity, which we described previously, acts as options for the future. Conversely, if a Reefscape is too big, baby corals will not be able to spread readily from one reef to the next, slowing down the potential for adaptation. By creating Adaptive Reefscapes that balance the need to be large and connected, we can find a Goldilocks solution that’s just right."

For his project, Justin chose to raise funds for the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and awareness about the current state of coral reefs. At an annual Innovation Fair in the early spring, students present products they design, test and mass produce to raise funds for their chosen organization. Justin designed and manufactured a beat blox, an “elegant, cordless iPhone speaker that doesn’t need to be charged.” At the end of the fair, Justin sold all 29 speakers and raised a record-breaking $580.

The goal of my school project was to raise awareness of what is happening to the coral reefs and to try to stop these delicate ecosystems from being destroyed. Coral reefs are so beautiful. I saw pretty amazing ones in the Philippines, and I know that they are in danger of dying all around the world because of dynamite fishing, human carelessness and pollution. Coral Reefs are very important because they protect the coastline from damaging storms and waves and they provide a habitat, shelter, and protection for thousands of marine organisms. By making people aware of the situation reefs face and getting support, I was also able to raise funds. I thought of a new product that would appeal to my school community that I could manufacture by myself. I love music, so I decided to make an iPhone speaker. I made a few prototypes that failed, or that didn’t look that great. It was very frustrating coming up with the idea. Finally, I came up with a speaker that worked, was solid and not too expensive to make. When I was sure I had my finished product, I started manufacturing the speakers. I created flyers to advertise to the school community. I also presented the product at the school assembly. I tried to create some buzz by talking to students about it.

Currently, coral reefs are suffering great losses due to local threats, such as overfishing and unsustainable tourism, and global threats, such as rising ocean temperatures. As the executive director of a coral conservation nonprofit, I must ask myself how we can save coral reefs. Fortunately, we have an answer found with the corals themselves. Today there is a growing scientific evidence that corals can adapt to environmental changes. In fact, corals have been adapting for hundreds of millions of years. We can see evidence of coral adaptation everywhere on coral reefs. For example, scientists are discovering corals that are thriving in harsh conditions, like the unusually warm waters in lagoons in American Samoa. These special corals are defying the assumption that corals are fragile and headed for extinction. To save coral reefs, we must reduce local-level threats to reefs that help these special corals survive, grow and spread their special genes to future generations and withstand global threats – this is the process of coral adaptation. Seizing upon this revelation, CORAL is pioneering an innovate conservation blueprint called   – healthy networks of  ,   and   reefs. Adaptive Reefscapes include many types of reefs, habitats, species and genes. We safeguard DIVERSITY to preserve options for an unpredictable future. Rapid adaptation requires a CONNECTED network of healthy reefs such as Marine Protected Areas or Locally Managed Marine Areas to facilitate the spread of baby corals to different reefs and repopulate degraded reefs. Small networks of reefs are vulnerable to a single disturbance such as a storm or a disease outbreak. Connecting LARGE networks of reefs protects reefscapes against losing everything all at once. With our many partners, we are creating an Adaptive Reefscape along the Mesoamerican reef region, which spans the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. Already, we have been able to identify key reefs where we can give corals a leg up by reducing coastal pollution and improving fisheries management. We are also developing a mathematical model to pinpoint additional reefs that we should protect to help corals adapt. Our goal is to launch similar Adaptive Reefscapes in three other key coral reef regions around the world. Creating successful reefscapes in these regions will provide a proven blueprint for global coral reef conservation."

For those that are landlocked or have never visited tropical waters, coral reefs probably don’t often come to their mind. However, for individuals like Justin Jesuele, a seventh grader at Viewpoint School in California, coral reefs and the ocean bring fond memories of sandy beaches, warm water and a sense of belonging. Recently, we featured a   about Justin’s school project when he created beat blox to raised funds for CORAL. This second post will provide more insight into this creative self-described environmentalist who wants to share his love of coral reefs with the world. Justin’s first memory of the ocean was as a very young child vacationing to  with his family. While there paddling on a boogie board with his good friend, he saw his first sea turtle in its natural habitat. He remembers the moment vividly because it made him feel like he belonged there experiencing nature and its “diverse ecosystem full of marine life and cool animals.” In addition to boogie boarding, Justin also loves doing activities such as snorkeling where he’s able to “see the beauty of the ocean.” Like others fortunate enough to visit coral reefs, Justin particularly enjoys and appreciates the “beautiful underwater world” created by corals and the diversity of animals and fish that live on, in and around reefs. His favorite type of coral is the brain coral or  . He’s fond of this coral because it’s long evolutionary history and because “it looks so much like a brain!” Justin also has a favorite reef fish: the black tip reef shark. He saw his first one while snorkeling in the Philippines off the coast of  . Having held a long fascination with sharks, Justin likes to equate them to the cops of the marine world due to their ability to help maintain the delicate balance between fish populations in marine ecosystems. He also enjoys the Hawaiian triggerfish ( ) simply because of its “really cool” name in native Hawaiian: humuhumunukunukuāpuaʻa; I mean, who can blame him! However, Justin worries about the future of our underwater havens. As Justin likes to put it, “coral reefs support all the life in the ocean in that all of the lives are interconnected in the marine ecosystem. Marine animals depend on coral reefs for protection and habitat. They are important to the ocean ecosystem. Also, coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and waves. Coral reefs are dying because of human carelessness and ignorance. Climate change, dynamite fishing and pollution all disturb the ecosystem — that can’t be good for the animals that live in the ocean or for the human species as a whole.” As an environmentalist, Justin cares about the positive and negative effects we have on our planet. He wants “to keep nature safe, and coral reefs are such an important part of the ocean.” The future of coral reefs is bright due to young champions like Justin who one day will don the mantle of coral preservation to save coral reefs."

Not too long ago, however, the local coral reefs had been devastated by overharvesting and pollution. What changed to allow these reefs to recover? Tisa Fa’amuli, a native Samoan and self-described eco-warrior, decided to take it upon herself to restore the reef. She created a   to raise awareness about the Sanctuary and expressed her mission to CORAL Board Member Michael Bennett, who recently visited American Samoa and had the opportunity to document and share Tisa’s inspiring story. Tisa Fa’amuli’s story starts on the island of Tutuila where she was born and raised by her father Afenoa. Being the second of twelve children, Tisa learned many lessons from her father about working hard, providing for a large family and respecting the land. “This is where I learned about conservation,” Tisa notes. While growing up in the 50s, “these words were not used: conservation, sustainable. We lived it. We didn’t identify them. It was a way of life. It was a way for survival.” These lessons stuck with Tisa and shaped her future in unexpected ways. At the age of 34, after numerous years living away from home, Tisa moved back to her hometown of Alega from San Diego, California and didn’t recognize her childhood village. The fish in the bay were gone, the coral reefs were dead and the beaches were covered in debris. Tisa soon realized “that this village needs to be restored.” To help kick start restoration efforts, Tisa and her two sons started clean-ups along the coastal highway and beaches. Local community members thought she had lost her mind “because nobody cleans the highway; it’s the government’s job.” It was around this same time in 1980 that Tisa decided to start protecting a small strip of beach and coastal waters near her property, creating a self-declared marine sanctuary. Her goal was to restore the local marine life back to what it was when she was a child. She created her own no-take zone that was largely enforced by word of mouth and a variety of self-enforcement methods. She and her partner, Candy Mann, performed night patrols looking for poachers and used flash lights to scare them away, sometimes even getting in a kayak to chase them off of the protected area. In 1989, inspired by these experiences, Tisa started Tisa’s Barefoot Bar & Eco-Resort, using the profits to help fund her conservation efforts. Over the years, Tisa learned to use education and outreach as an effective tool for protecting her special sanctuary and gaining local buy-in. By speaking with local fishermen and villagers, she could convince them about the importance of caring for the marine environment, not catching baby fish, or not catching entire schools of fish. “I would just engage them in conservation and have them really feel my heart as a sincere way (not) to come and destroy or kill the reef, walk on the reef (or) try to get the fish” explains Tisa. “I put it in forms of education that they understand.” In order to ensure that these life lessons get passed down to future generations, Tisa has started training her grandchildren on how to protect the reef and has shared stories from her father about always caring for the land and taking pride in your roots. Thanks to Tisa’s time and effort, in 2013, the local government officially created a no-take Marine Protected Area (MPA) with a stated goal to “educate other communities how to start Marine Sanctuaries to protect our beautiful islands and education on indigenous fishing seasons and methods.” Tisa’s future goal is to have a place that is open to local people to come, learn and enjoy marine life in perpetuity, and, through her hard work and dedication, she has created just that opportunity."

HRI Report Cards give sites a reef health score, analyze changes over time, and propose actions to improve reef health and enable reefs to endure and thrive.   The recently released   tells us that overall reef health in the MAR has improved from an initial reef health index of Poor (2.3) in 2006 to Fair (2.8) this year, using a scale that ranges from Critical (1) to Very Good (5). The positive trend is a result of increases in fish biomass, which are attributable to stronger fisheries management and a significant increase in Marine Protected Areas, which now cover 57% of the MAR. Of the four countries that comprise the MAR – Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico –   received the highest score for reef health (3.0). In addition to having relatively high coral cover, Honduras has the highest biomass of herbivorous fishes (like parrotfish and surgeonfish), which feed intensively on macroalgae, a kind of fleshy algae that can grow unchecked in polluted waters and outcompete corals for space.

HRI commenced the   in a big way with simultaneous launches of the 2018 Report Card in Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico. The events were well attended by partners and other allies, and received significant local and international media coverage. CORAL was proud to participate in Honduras’ Report Card launch on January 10  in Tegucigalpa. The 2018 Report Card also marks a decade of data collection by HRI, providing an important temporal perspective on trends in reef health. Despite the fact that corals worldwide were hard-hit by mass bleaching over the last few years, 10 years of reef monitoring by HRI tells us that things are looking up in the MAR. With the 2018 Report Card launch marking a decade of collaboration and conservation, the good news for the Mesoamerican region’s reefs, and the kick-off of the third International Year of the Reef, 2018 is off to a great start!    "

        "content": "Bali’s Mount Agung erupted again on February 13, 2018, just days after Indonesian authorities lowered the alert status from Hazardous (Level IV) to Standby (Level III). The eruption lasted just over two minutes and spewed ash and smoke 1.5 kilometers into the air. Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported that there was no damage, community activities are running normally and flights to Bali continue to operate despite the eruption. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) continues to monitor and support our community partners in the affected villages of Tulamben, Amed and Jemeluk. Mount Agung began exhibiting pre-eruption seismic activity in September, 2017, and authorities evacuated communities within a 12-kilometer radius of the volcano. When two eruptions occurred in late November nearly 140,000 people had been evacuated, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Mount Agung erupted again several times but with less intensity, and authorities lowered the alert status to Level III on February 11, 2018. But two days later the volcano erupted again and reignited fear and anxiety in nearby communities. Concerns are especially heightened as older generations vividly remember the devastating effects of the 1963 eruption, which claimed the lives of approximately 1,600 people, destroyed dozens of villages and lasted for almost a year. I Made Jaya Ratha, CORAL’s Indonesia Program Coordinator, reports that most evacuees from Tulamben have returned home, and reef monitoring and trash cleanup programs have resumed. Challenging conditions such as lack of food and crowded sleeping areas have been contributing factors in the decision to return home to an at-risk area. But life at home is not easy, says Ratha. Tourism is the primary economic driver for many coastal communities in the region, and a scuba diving moratorium in Tulamben closed resorts in October and November. The tourism industry is also struggling in the nearby villages of Amed and Jemeluk, after visitors canceled bookings in light of travel warnings. Meanwhile, prices of fresh produce have increased as ash falls on fields that lack farmers to tend them. Despite these challenges, communities are coming together to rebuild their lives. CORAL staff brought fresh water, vegetables and ventilation masks to evacuated communities during the worst of the volcanic activity, and are working with villages to prioritize their needs. While the memory of the 1963 eruption still looms in their minds, community members are returning home, looking forward and hoping for a calmer future."

        "content": "Popularly known as staghorn corals, due to the similarity of their structure with that of the antler of the mammal in question, the   corals are one of the most important corals in the region of the Mesoamerican Reef System (MAR) because they are reef builders. Thanks to their strong substrate and their peculiar shape,   offer shelter to juvenile fish and protect coastal communities against strong waves. However, there are relatively few places in the Caribbean that still hold large extensions of this coral species. One of these is the Cordelia Banks Wildlife Site, located on the southwest of Roatan Island, Honduras, where the number of   individuals is impressive, says marine biologist  , coordinator of the Smithsonian Institution’s  . “The number of these corals in that bank is surprising, especially after the massive die-off—due to an unknown agent—that in the 1980s reduced their presence in the Caribbean. Approximately 90 percent of them were lost. In addition, this population managed to recover from a bleaching event that affected the corals of Roatán about four years ago and continues to survive, despite being located very close to cruise ship docks and the amount of pollutants it receives from nearby populations,” adds Canty. And it is precisely these signs of vitality and resilience of the   of Cordelia Banks that make it a site of interest not only for tourism but also for science, as a source of propagules (coral larvae) with the potential to repopulate reef communities in the MAR region. For this reason, the organization   (CORAL) sponsored the study of the genetic diversity of the corals of the Cordelia Banks, that is, the total number of different genetic characteristics among them. Such differences are a basic component of biodiversity, and the greater the genetic diversity, the more likely a species is to survive environmental changes. To carry out this research, CORAL contacted Steven Canty, who together with fellow scientists Graeme Fox, Jennifer K. Rowntree, and Richard F. Preziosi, produced the study entitled:   It was published in February 2021 by the journal  (the article is open access) The summary of the document states that: “Amongst the global decline of coral reefs, hope spots such as Cordelia Banks in Honduras have been identified. This site contains dense, remnant thickets of the endangered species  , which local managers and conservation organizations view as a potential source population for coral restoration projects.” According to Canty, CORAL, in addition to being interested in the knowledge of this important coral bank for the MAR region, wanted to have solid scientific evidence to update their management plan. However, how do you manage corals if their biology is unknown? For this reason, he and his colleagues conducted the previously mentioned study. Cordelia Banks is a protected area formed by four coral banks where   sharks and a spawning site for snappers and groupers are present. Samples for the study were taken in 2014 from three of those banks: Big Cay; Cordelia Shoal and Smith Bank. Biologist Mayra Núñez Vallecillo was one of the researchers who participated in the collection of samples. Mayra describes Cordelia Banks as a paradise under the sea, and indicates that having participated in this field work helped her expand her knowledge of coral reefs. According to the biologist, research of this type is important to generate adequate management and conservation tools for the protection of marine ecosystems, on which not only plants and animals, but also people depend upon for their survival. Canty indicates that an important survival mechanism of   fragmentation and the fragmented pieces are carried by the currents, therefore, they can settle in places near or far from the specimen from which they were detached. This situation makes it difficult to determine whether a new coral comes from the same individual, a clone (asexual reproduction), or is the product of the union of two different ones (sexual reproduction). If the specimens come from the same individual, their use to restore degraded coral areas would not be the best option, because since the fragments have the same genetic material, they would all be susceptible to the same diseases or disorders caused by stressful situations, Canty explains. In Cordelia Banks, where the large numbers of colonies of this species cover about 63,440 square meters, “it was possible to identify a low genetic diversity in the three banks of the protected area and the genetic similarity of the colonies ranged from 91.3 to 95.8 percent between the banks. ‘Clonality’ rates were approximately 30 percent across all three banks. And each genotype identified was unique to each bank,” the study notes. “Subtle differences were demonstrated within and among the banks, that is, not all of them come from the same individual. The presence of multiple genotypes suggests   colonies from these banks could be used to maintain and enhance genetic diversity in restoration projects.” For this reason, the study indicates that “management of hope spots, such as Cordelia Banks, and the incorporation of genetic information into restoration projects to ensure genetic diversity within out-planted populations, will be critical in the ongoing challenge of conserving and preserving coral reefs.” Canty explains that he is happy with these findings from the study, because there is more genetic diversity in the   of Cordelia Banks than they thought, and it motivates him to conduct a similar study with mangroves and seagrasses because it is important to know the existing connectivity between small populations in these ecosystems and in the entire MAR region. The data obtained, as well as those produced by the aforementioned research, are used to develop management plans based on scientific evidence. Furthermore, they contribute to identifying the potential for adaptation of ecosystems, so that coastal communities know how to lead this management. For a conservation strategy to be successful, it is necessary to involve the people living in the area, says the biologist. Canty’s recommendation, for those who lead coral restoration projects with fragments of the Cordelia Banks corals, is that they keep a genetic diary, so that they know which fragment and from which colony they used to transplant in a certain site. , an environmental engineer and CORAL’s Regional Program Director in the MAR, explains that the efforts of her work are focused on actions that will help the Mesoamerican Reef thrive. For example, it is imperative that the inflow and negative impact of wastewater on Cordelia Banks be reduced, as the quality of the surrounding water must be optimal in order for it to remain healthy. The conservation work at Cordelia Banks, which according to data from the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative has 72.23 percent live coral (the average in the MAR is 19 percent), also aims to honor its declaration by the Honduran government as a Site of Importance for Wildlife. This declaration, achieved in 2012, took seven years of work from various governmental and non-governmental organizations, among them CORAL. For that reason, the data produced by the study by Canty and colleagues will be useful for teaming up with the other organizations involved to update the site’s Management Plan and to determine and guide the actions to be implemented, concludes Jenny."

        "content": "The CORAL family came together last week in a unique way. A few months ago, the Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS) reached out to Jaya Ratha, our program coordinator in Bali, to help organize the arrival of the Hōkūleʻa in Indonesia. The Hōkūleʻa is a double-hulled standing canoe traveling around the world using traditional navigation methods. Their voyage, called  , or to care for the Earth, is an effort to bring together global partners to protect our Earth and our oceans. “One of the things that was interesting to me was that Hawaiʻi and Bali have a lot of similarities in terms of culture,” said Ratha. Bali and Hawaiʻi were designated as sister states back in 2014, as they are both hugely popular tourism destinations and they share similar histories. This amazing around-the-world voyage brought the Hawaiian culture and heritage to Indonesia—making these two diverse islands feel incredibly connected. As a complete coincidence, CORAL’s Program Coordinator in Maui, Chana Ane, remembers going on one of the early launchings of the Hōkūleʻa and her family is extremely involved in PVS. During its voyage, the Hōkūleʻa stops in various ports to raise awareness. The PVS brings in teachers from Hawaiʻi to join the crew and bring traditional knowledge and contemporary ideas to local communities. The Hōkūleʻa arrived in Bali on August 1, after leaving Australia, and we, along with Reef Check Indonesia, Lensa Masyarakat Nusantara (LMN) and CI Indonesia, helped connect them with various communities in Bali, including the Amed community in the Karangesem regency. The community in Amed has worked hard to protect its ocean environment, which is now officially recognized as a locally managed marine area. The arrival of the PVS helped raise awareness about their work. In addition, it helped connect the community with local government officials to highlight the conservation initiatives underway. While in Amed, the Hōkūleʻa team snorkeled with a community guide and saw the effects of the various threats harming coral reefs. These threats were not unknown to them, as many mirror the same ones affecting Hawaiʻi’s coral reefs. They also learned about traditional salt making, and heard from a small group of people trying to protect and maintain Balinese antiquity. The group shared stories and spoke about traditions and their different cultures. What they learned is that they face similar challenges. Tourism is increasing in Bali. Particularly, in the small town of Amed where people are struggling to protect their values and beliefs. The PVS team from Hawaii was empathetic. They passed along insight on how their state has coped with the influx of tourists, and how they’ve worked to protect their environment, heritage, and cultural identity. Our international teams are spread out all over the world, but we are all connected in various ways. The coming together of the Hawaiian and Balinese cultures made that very evident this week. Like the PVS, we believe in global partnerships. After all, we won’t be able to protect coral reefs without them. Read more about the Hōkūleʻa’s visit to Bali on  , updated regularly.  "

But imagine going back to school and learning about real local issues, and then learning real life skills and using them to solve actual problems in your community. That’s what students in Mr. Ryan Duffy’s class went back to this year. Mr. Duffy teaches sixth through eighth grade math and science at ROOTS school in Haiku on Maui, Hawaiʻi. Last October he came to CORAL’s Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) workshop and learned how to teach his students about the importance of watersheds in a way that’s fun and exciting. He’s applying those skills, and his students are completely engaged! Soon after the workshop, Mr. Duffy’s students started designing a system to capture rain water off their school’s rooftop. They collected data to determine the average rainfall for their region, and measured the surface area of the school’s roof. They compiled this information to calculate the amount of rain they could catch and researched various rain water harvesting systems. They even built a first flush diverter to prevent the polluted water from the beginning of a rain event—and all the debris it brings off the roof—from entering the water catchment tanks. By spring, the students had completed their data collection and calculations and were ready to install their water catchment tanks. Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company donated two 500-gallon water catchment tanks, and CORAL’s Program Manager, Wes Crile, and Mr. Duffy helped install them.  The school is now able to divert about 1,000 gallons of rainwater from entering the ocean at nearby Hoʻokipa Beach each time it rains. Hoʻokipa isn’t too far from the world-famous surf spot, Jaws, and it’s a popular place for windsurfing and kite surfing. Preventing rainwater from entering the ocean there not only helps protect human health, but also helps protect coral reefs. The students will continue the project this year by measuring the rainwater catchment system and its impacts. They will also start monitoring water quality at Hoʻokipa beach and learn about the impacts that sediment and rainwater runoff have on the coral reefs. Soon they’ll start to see how their school project fits into the health of the entire watershed."

        "content": "You’ve probably heard about it in the news. You may even remember living through it in the early 80s and 90s. El Niño is here. It’s already impacting the Pacific Ocean and this August, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) saw variances in sea surface temperatures near or greater than 2.0 degrees Celsius. El Niño refers to warming waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Those warmer waters spread to the east, bringing with them a drastic change in weather patterns. Scientists predict that this year’s El Niño is extreme and may last through the spring of 2016. That means trouble for coral reefs. In fact, NOAA recently announced that “bleaching due to heat stress is expected to impact approximately 38 percent of the world’s coral reefs—and almost 95% of those in U.S. waters.” When water temperatures grow too warm, corals become stressed and oust the tiny algae that live in their tissues, called zooxanthellae. Corals and zooxanthellae have a mutually beneficial relationship that can be disrupted by changing temperatures. Without zooxanthellae, corals lose an important food source which significantly limits their ability to grow. Zooxanthellae are also responsible for giving corals their brilliant and vibrant colors—without them, corals bleach and turn a skeletal white color. Coral bleaching isn’t necessarily the same thing as corals dying. Corals can survive bleaching events, but their survival is contingent on the how warm the water gets and how long the warm period lasts. They will, however, have a harder time recovering if they are already struggling or unhealthy. If there’s a back-to-back series of warm water events, and if corals are already stressed from overfishing and pollution, mortality rates can skyrocket. Given the local threats reefs face in many places, we can expect high coral mortality especially if this year’s El Niño is as strong as scientists predict. We’re disappointed to report that we’ve already seen coral bleaching in Hawai‘i and elsewhere in the Pacific. The warm waters of an El Niño are also associated with an increase in the number of tropical cyclones. These weather events can cause a lot of physical destruction to a reef. If corals bleach, they have a hard time recovering—their growth is curtailed without their partner, zooxanthellae. The combination of increased water temperatures and storm activity can be a “double whammy” for coral reefs. El Niño is a natural phenomenon and we can’t stop it. When you add an El Niño to an already stressed system its effects are more severe. So what can you do about it? You can reduce your emissions and advocate on behalf of clean energy. When you’re out diving you can report bleached corals to local reef managers or to ReefBase (www.ReefBase.org). You can also help us do what we do best—unite communities to reduce local threats. If reefs are healthy, with clean water and an abundant amount of fish life, we can expect the corals to come back later. If we combine our efforts across the globe we can help give corals a fighting chance at surviving these environmental changes."

Even the   has been running a series of articles on coral reefs. I’ve worked with corals for more than 10 years and I can’t remember a time when they’ve ever been so mainstream and popular. But here’s the problem: it’s all doom and gloom. All of the news that’s coming out is bad news. Where’s the optimism? Where’s the hope? Where are the success stories? That’s one of the things I love about CORAL. We know we CAN save coral reefs, and with the right amount of support, we WILL. And that’s why I enjoyed my most recent trip to Bali, Indonesia. I strategically aligned my trip so I could attend the first-ever Buleleng Bali Dive Festival, which was held in Pemuteran. Some of you may remember hearing about it at our 2014 Gala, when the Indonesian Minister of Fisheries and Affairs announced the festival for the first time. The festival was a huge success—complete with a parade, traditional ceremony, educational talks, and of course, unforgettable diving. But, what really hit home on this trip was seeing how motivated and impassioned the local communities are about protecting coral reefs. It was the success stories that really stood out. Take Nyoman Suastika for example. Nyoman lives in the community of Tulamben, a small fishing village in Bali known for one of the best wreck dives in the world. Divers and dive operators consistently dive in this area, but the increase in tourism was damaging the coral and harming the ecosystem. Dive operators from out of the area accompanied visiting divers, which meant a lot of the benefits of tourism weren’t staying within the community. As a result, the community didn’t have the resources to protect the environment. Nyoman took notice and started talking to his community about the issue. His community had a no-take conservation area, and he attended trainings to learn how to turn it into a formalized Marine Protected Area—a conservation area that is formally recognized and supported by the national government—and to ensure it is effectively managed. With the help of CORAL and our local partners, Nyoman organized his community to take action. Together, they established a local group of dive guides called Organisasi Dive Guide Tulamben. Dive operators from outside of Tulamben now call on the local group to lead their trips, instead of sending in guides from outside the area. As a result, more of the tourism fees stay within the community. This enables the community to oversee and manage how their local coral reefs are utilized. CORAL is helping Nyoman and his community protect and manage the local coral reefs in a variety of ways. This includes: Nyoman is an incredibly humble and down-to-earth individual. His motivating driver is simple: his goal is to improve Tulamben’s reefs. He envisions a future where his community understands that conservation is beneficial and leads to a healthy reef and community. He envisions a community that prioritizes sustainable land-use practices. And he envisions an ocean without trash and with an abundant array of fish and wildlife. There is so much incredible work happening in Bali, and around the world, to protect coral reefs. THIS is the kind of ground-up work that we should see in the news. I hope Nyoman’s story inspires you as much as it inspires me. Together we CAN and we WILL continue to protect coral reefs for generations to come."

        "content": "On the northern coast of Honduras, just a few miles west of Tela through lush tropical forests, sits Laguna de los Micos. The Laguna is a treasure trove of biodiversity, surrounded by mangroves and separated from the Caribbean Sea by only a few feet of sand. It’s one of the area’s most important coral reef habitats, and serves as a respite, home and nursery for hundreds of coral reef fish. The Laguna has always been an important area for local communities, providing subsistence and livelihoods. But in recent years, the fishermen weren’t catching as much. Fish populations seemed to be disappearing. Laguna de los Micos is part of the Parque Nacional Jeannette Kawas. The area is protected and has a management plan that includes fishing regulations. For example, boats cannot carry more than 600 meters of net, and the mesh size must be at least three inches. In some waterways you can only fish with hook and line, and spear guns or dynamite are prohibited. The regulations are numerous—but there was never enough money or local participation to enforce them. This year, CORAL and many of its local partners, helped create a patrol program for the lagoon. The Institutional Committee of Fisheries and Marine Resources in Tela*—a conglomeration of government organizations and local NGOs—provides the resources and man-power. CORAL provides the funding and training. A typical patrol may include a car from PROLANSATE, a boat from DIGEPESCA and field techniques from each organization. It’s a true example of collaboration, and it works. Fishermen now report seeing mackerel over 30cm in length, and many regularly catch jacks that weigh more than 10 pounds. The fishermen support the patrols, and are grateful that they are conducted by a local committee. They say it keeps the process honest and transparent. This collaboration is an exemplary model. It’s proof that great things happen when we work together. Conservation isn’t just about protecting the environment, it’s also about working alongside the communities that rely on that environment. And when governments, communities and NGOs partner together, environments thrive."

She makes her way down to the water, finds the spot where the fishermen will disembark after their morning catch, and sits down to wait. On the northern Caribbean coast of Honduras, Tela Bay sits at the bottom of a gently sloping tropical forest, marked by beautiful white sand beaches and sparkling turquoise water. It’s home to some of the healthiest coral reefs in all of Central America—scientists estimate that the bay averages about 70% live coral cover, the highest in the Mesoamerican Reef system. When she sees the first boat begin to approach, Urrutia pulls out her equipment and marks down the time of arrival. She approaches the vessel and requests permission to collect data from their catch. The fishermen are used to her presence by now and her research has become a standard part of their disembarkation routine. She analyzes the fish they caught, carefully documenting all of her measurements. Urrutia was hired as CORAL’s first community scientist in Honduras in 2015. Today she’s one of three community scientists that CORAL employs in the country to gain a better understanding of what is happening to local fisheries. CORAL’s community scientists live in or near the communities where they work, which helps them build relationships and gain trust. They tend to be women, most often from minority groups, who have struggled to find adequate employment and face social and economic vulnerability. Though several of them come from fishing backgrounds with relatives and family members who fish, this is their first foray into science and research. CORAL Program Coordinators train them on the basic science of fisheries and how to appropriately and accurately collect and monitor data. “I have changed a lot thanks to CORAL,” says Greissi Lizeth Villatoro, who began working as a community scientist in early 2019. She works in Laguna de los Micos, a popular fish nursery in the lagoon that feeds Tela Bay. “I have learned many things that I did not know, and taking the data has also helped me a lot.” The program not only provides the scientists with paid employment and much-needed economic stability, but CORAL’s Program Coordinators also encourage the women to work toward personal goals and pursue their education as a way of investing in themselves and their families. Urrutia herself left her role as a community scientist in 2016 to go back to school at the urging of CORAL’s then Program Coordinator. Now that she has graduated, she has come back to CORAL, and has taken on more duties. She’s now supervising the maintenance and data collection of CORAL’s experimental aquaculture project in Tela—a project designed to create an economic alternative for fishermen—in addition to working as a community scientist in Tela Bay. Through their relationships, the women have created a network of fishermen that help support science and understand the importance of rules and regulations. They’ve become a regular presence at community meetings, and report back on their findings to help fishermen understand what is happening underwater. “The most important impact that I’ve noticed is that now people have more respect for closed seasons,” says Urrutia. “Before, 100% of fishermen went out to fish during the closed season, now only between 10-20% are going to fish illegally.” Urrutia has also noticed an increase in fishermen who talk openly about complying with regulations—they chat with each other about following regulations and avoiding damaging practices like anchoring on the reef. Practices that protect the environment are becoming more commonplace. Villatoro has also seen changes among the crabbing community in the lagoon near Tela. “Through the data collection, the crabbers have been learning the appropriate size of crabs to capture,” says Villatoro. “The fishermen’s company has stopped buying small crabs, and several fishermen have stopped using illegal nets where the mesh size is less than three inches.” This change in behavior is a direct result of the relationships and trust the community scientists have built within their communities. They have gained a reputation as being allies, and fishermen see them as a key component to decision making and managing their resource. “In the community where I come from, the work of a community scientist is seen as a means to improve fishing and to find out how the resource is doing,” says Ana Bessy Valdez. She joined the CORAL team in July 2019 and was the first community scientist to start monitoring in Trujillo Bay, the southern border of the Mesoamerican Reef system. “Fishermen are aware that data collection is to improve fishing and they want to know what alternatives they have for bad seasons.” Though not all of the fishermen that Valdez meets choose to provide her with data, the majority enjoy collaborating. Back in Tela, Urrutia casually chats with the fishermen while she takes her measurements. She asks them about their fishing location, depth, travel time, and expenses. The fishermen know Urrutia by now, and they trust her. They tell her who is still out on the water, and when and where they will likely land. She packs up her equipment, and relocates down the beach so she can be ready for the next arrival. When the last boat arrives at 10:00 a.m., she takes her last measurements, and bids her fishing friends farewell. She’ll be back tomorrow, same time, same place."

Throughout my time here, that initial impression has held steady: our staff works tirelessly every single day to support the local communities that depend on coral reefs, and together with our partners, they move mountains to ensure coral reefs have what they need to not only survive, but thrive. And our supporters remain steadfast in their commitment to protecting coral reefs for generations to come.  That is why I am full of both sadness and gratitude as I write to inform you I have decided to step away from my role as CORAL’s Executive Director. CORAL is a remarkable organization, and one that I will always hold dear to my heart. I am grateful that this position has allowed me to explore nonprofit administration and management, which has  led me to realize that my passion lies in conducting the direct science and conservation work that makes CORAL thrive. It has been an absolute honor to witness how CORAL has evolved over the last decade. We have grown to become a leader in a ground-breaking conservation movement that uses evolution to rescue reefs from climate change. We continue to partner with communities to protect coral reefs, but we now focus on directly addressing the biggest threats to reefs, like poor water quality and overfishing, and we do it in a way that allows coral reefs to adapt to climate change. And most recently, when the world was rocked by a global pandemic, we pivoted to ensure our partners could continue their reef-saving work amidst their unprecedented economic losses.  The CORAL Board of Directors has launched a   for a new Executive Director to assume responsibility when I depart in early June. I am confident that my successor will bring CORAL’s work at local, regional, and global levels to new heights as CORAL continues its vital efforts to keep coral reefs healthy so they can adapt to climate change. Thank you for all of your support over these last 10 years. I will miss this tremendous organization and community dearly, though I look forward to our paths crossing in a new way as we all continue to fight for coral reefs.  Thank you for your ongoing commitment to CORAL, and for making my time here so memorable.  With heartfelt appreciation, Madhavi Colton, Ph.D."

Nearly $375 billion in services comes from coral reefs alone each year. As a global community, we simply cannot afford to lose our coral reefs.  Today’s ruling is an ecocide—an unlawful act that was committed knowing that there will be widespread damage to the environment. The decision by the partisan and politicized Supreme Court to ignore science and instead rule in favor of corporate revenue puts us all at risk. Without clear action from our nation’s leaders, the lifesaving measures we need to curb emissions and slow the rate of climate change are out of reach.  In January, a report by the International Panel on Climate Change showed that if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half by 2030, we can still limit global warming to 2.7°F. The report showed that was an achievable target with appropriate government action. We are currently on track for 4.9°F of global warming, which from a coral reef standpoint alone, would create simultaneous ecological, humanitarian and economic crises.  Now is the time to take bigger, bolder action to address the climate crisis. We formally call on the leaders of this great nation to respond to today’s setback by passing legislation that curbs our greenhouse gas emissions with urgency and severity.  The science is clear: we must do more, and we must do it quickly.

        "content": "The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) was honored to be recognized by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies Annual Meeting as one of six organizations and individuals to receive The Climate Adaptation Leadership Award for Natural Resources (CALA) on September 9, 2020. The CALA was established in 2016 to recognize exemplary leadership in the field of climate adaptation and the protection of the nation’s vital natural resources and the people who depend on them in a changing world. “Climate change poses growing risks to our nation’s valuable fish and wildlife resources and the many people, businesses and communities that depend upon them,” stated Kelly Hepler, President of the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and Secretary of the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks. “This year’s awardees have done outstanding work to help safeguard species, habitats, and communities in a changing world, and we are thrilled to recognize their efforts.” In 2015, CORAL launched a pioneering research project to understand what actions we can take today to help corals adapt to climate change. The results, published in Nature Climate Change, show that evolution can help rescue reefs from the effects of climate change. The research shows that when we conserve a diverse portfolio of coral reefs species, variable environmental conditions and significant connectivity, we enable the necessary conditions for nature’s survivors to spread their genes to future generations. The research also shows that adaptation is possible when local stressors are reduced across a network of sites. The result is an Adaptive Reefscape: a network of healthy reefs in which corals can adapt to climate change. A vitally important component of CORAL’s Adaptive Reefscape approach is that the reefs within the network are healthy. This means that reducing direct threats to reefs, particularly unsustainable fishing and land-based pollution, is essential. Well-managed reefs serve as sources of repopulation over the long-term, enabling coral survivors to rescue other reefs across a region. As a leader in coral conservation, CORAL works with communities and conservation professionals around the world to turn the peer-reviewed scientific results into action to give reefs the best chance to survive the coming decades. “We are beyond thrilled to have been selected as one of this year’s CALA Award winners for our work on Adaptive Reefscapes,” says Dr. Madhavi Colton, Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance. “Our research shows that coral reefs can adapt to climate change if they are kept healthy. It is an honor to have the backing of fish and wildlife agencies as we work with local communities and conservation professionals around the world to create the conditions in which corals can adapt.” This award is sponsored and guided by the Climate Adaptation Leadership Awards Steering Committee which is made up of representatives from the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and various Federal agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

These baby corals are starting unique journeys, following ocean currents for a few days or weeks before settling down on new reefs.

Baby corals are looking for a reef that has conditions that match their individual needs.

But some baby corals are special because they inherited an ability to thrive where others can’t. When reefs are well connected, these special corals can grow and spread from one reef to the next, building the reefs of tomorrow. We can help corals by creating safe environments, such as Marine Protected Areas or Locally Managed Marine Areas, which provide the best conditions for baby corals such as clear water and healthy fish populations.

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet and are home to 25 percent of all marine life though they occupy less than one percent of our oceans. There are sponges and corals of all shapes and sizes, hard and soft; tiny fishes like pygmy seahorses and big fishes like tiger sharks; there are anemones, nudibranchs and snails – the list goes on! Reefs are also diverse in types of habitats: fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls to name a few. Even a single species of coral is genetically diverse. But why does coral reef diversity matter in an era of global climate change? We all know the facts: corals face an uncertain future due to local threats, such as pollution and overfishing, and global threats, such as climate change and ocean acidification. But without the reef-building corals, like staghorn or elkhorn, there is no reef and no habitat for the myriad forms of life that call reefs home. If we are to have reefs in the future, these reef-builders will need to adapt. Fortunately, scientific research shows us that corals can adapt to changing climates. At the Coral Reef Alliance, we are developing a blueprint based on cutting-edge science that promotes coral adaptation within diverse, connected and large networks of healthy reefs called  . Our Adaptive Reefscape strategy draws ideas from evolutionary biology, economics and ecology. Evolutionary biology tells us that adaptation is more successful when there is a lot of diversity, like the diversity found within the many types of reefs, habitats, species and genes on coral reefs. In this case, more diversity means more evolutionary options for the future. Similarly, financial investors know that diversifying their portfolio can hedge bets against an uncertain future. In a diverse investment portfolio, some stocks behave independently from one another making the whole portfolio more stable. Researchers have discovered that diversity also affects ecological systems, which are less prone to boom and bust cycles when they are diverse. By combing these ideas in an Adaptive Reefscape that safeguards a diversity of habitats, species and genes, corals will be better able to adapt to global environmental changes and survive for centuries to come. We are first applying our Adaptive Reefscape strategy to the Mesoamerican Reef, which spans the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. In this region alone, there are over 60 species of coral. Two sites in this region are showing promising signs of adaptation. Corals in Tela Bay on the mainland of Honduras are thriving in murky waters. Off the coast of nearby Roatán, there are unusually lush stands of staghorn coral, which has declined almost everywhere else in the Caribbean. When corals surprise us by doing particularly well in unexpected places, it suggests that they may have already adapted to some of the threats that are facing coral reefs. Adaptive Reefscapes are designed to protect a diversity of reefs and corals so that special corals—like those in Tela and Roatán—can be the source of baby corals that will thrive in the future.

        "content": "From raging wildfires to melting glaciers to coral bleaching—it is clear that there is pressing urgency to face the planet’s climate and ecological emergency. After postponing last year’s event due to COVID-19, the   (IUCN) decided to hold its quadrennial   from September 3 to 11, 2021 and commit to actions that will ensure a more sustainable future.  Members from more than 160 countries in government, science, civil society, and business sectors met in Marseille, France—along with many more participating virtually. One of those attendees was CORAL’s Hawaiʻi Regional Program Director  , representing the Hawaiʻi Conservation Alliance, an IUCN member organization and previous host to the 2016 World Conservation Congress.  We had a chance to catch up with Mejia after he returned from Marseille, getting a “behind-the-scenes” look at the main highlights and why there are reasons to be optimistic.  Previously, Mejia attended the 2016 Congress that took place in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, where a new membership category called the “Indigenous Peoples Organizations” was formed. Since its establishment, Mejia has noticed a significant increase of individuals from the Indigenous Peoples Organizations represented at IUCN.  “Indigenous voices are finally being elevated and listened to,” says Mejia, expressing the importance of taking a biocultural approach to conservation. “In the Pacific, and in Indigenous cultures in general, people are part of the equation. They aren’t separate from nature. As nature thrives, people thrive.”  At the Congress, Mejia proudly represented our partners in Hawaiʻi at the “Pacific Pavilion,” where members living in Oceania and the Pacific Islands spoke about topics relevant to their region. Mejia gave a presentation and shared the significance of “mauka to makai” conservation approaches in Hawaiʻi, or “ridge to reef.” He explained why taking care of land and sea is an important element to local cultures and island communities, like Hawaiʻi, and how communities are leading conservation efforts guided by Indigenous values and knowledge. Climate change was also an important topic at this year’s event. During the Congress, the Union made great progress by establishing the first official “Climate Change Commission” within IUCN—a motion widely led and supported by members of the Hawaiʻi Delegation, including Mejia.   According to  released by IUCN, “A climate crisis commission with a single focus to implement a unified plan to save the earth—providing a venue for those who wish to be part of the final stand—will protect future generations, Indigenous people and nature.” This new establishment will contribute to the worldwide effort to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the planet’s changing climate. This decision was a major victory for the Hawaiʻi delegation, as they feel firsthand the impacts of climate change to the Pacific. “Small islands are the canaries in the coal mine,” says Mejia. “They are the most vulnerable frontliners when it comes to climate change impacts.”  As a whole, Mejia felt this year’s Congress took an “all hands on deck” approach to conservation—with a strong sense of inclusion, collaboration, and dedication.  From   to presentations by youth conservationists to the involvement of the Marseille community, people from so many generations, backgrounds, and countries joined forces to seek nature-based solutions. Even French President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech, demonstrating his leadership in tackling climate change and expressing the importance of protecting nature—as our well-being depends on it.  Recent reports and studies all show that there is a dire need for real change. But Mejia is optimistic and sees this as an opportunity to come together and amplify meaningful conservation efforts. In the words of Harrison Ford, “We’ve got to get to work. We’ve got to make things happen—we’ve got to make it happen now.”"

After analyzing almost 2 million observations collected in 73 countries, one key message is abundantly clear—coral reefs are in trouble.  We’ve lost 14 percent of the world’s coral reefs in the last decade and according to Dr. Madhavi Colton, CORAL’s Executive Director, this is likely a conservative measurement. “It’s the equivalent of losing the entire Great Barrier Reef in 10 years,” she says.  Sadly, global findings show that many reefs are diminishing, instead of flourishing. This decline is mostly attributed to large scale   events, which first captured the attention of scientists in 1998 and have since become a regular occurrence. Climate change leads to warming ocean temperatures which can trigger bleaching and ultimately impact the health of coral reefs.    When corals die, algae can take over a reef and create a hostile environment that inhibits new coral growth. The GCRMN measured a 20 percent increase in algae living on coral reefs from 2010 to 2019, further demonstrating the severity of local reef threats and bleaching events.  But despite these upsetting statistics, the GCRMN also validated corals’ resilience and underscored the importance of acting quickly to save coral reefs. “The report isn’t an obituary—the report says there is still hope for coral reefs,” says Colton. “If you look at the data, there are times when corals have recovered.” According to the GCRMN, coral reefs have the ability to recover when the conditions permit. This can include minimizing water pollution or addressing overfishing, in order to create more optimal conditions for reefs to adapt to climate change. In fact, some reefs in the East Asian Seas region with high coral cover and diversity have already shown signs of natural resistance to increasing temperatures. Here at CORAL, we believe reefs can adapt to the effects of climate change if they are healthy. Over the last five years, we’ve been spearheading research to better understand what coral reefs need in order to adapt, and how to create those conditions in the real world. Ultimately, what it comes down to is working with local communities to keep corals healthy, and doing that in strategic places around the world.  That’s why we work with partners, governments, and members of local communities in the Mesoamerican region and Hawaiʻi to ensure cleaner, healthier reefs. Through these collaborations, we have trapped sediment before it reaches reefs in West Maui, supported community scientists working with fishers in Trujillo, monitored water quality in Roatán, and more.   The GCRMN report is out just in time for the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) and the UN Biodiversity Summit, when world leaders will join together to discuss future actions to address climate change, as well as ocean protection. “I hope this report becomes a large, loud alarm bell,” says Colton. “It provides the justification needed for world leaders to take a strong stance.”  In fact, the GCRMN report is already creating a buzz, with coverage appearing in major outlets like The New York Times and CNN International. And it’s important to continue spreading the word and educating the public about the significance of protecting coral reefs.  After all, coral reefs are strong and resilient, but they are also undeniably vulnerable—and if we want to save them, we need to take action now. "

        "content": "By Madhavi Colton, Ph.D.; Helen Fox, Ph.D.; Lisa McManus, Ph.D.; and Malin Pinsky, Ph.D. The trends are clear: around the world, coral reefs are dying. Just a few weeks ago we learned that we lost 14% of the world’s coral reefs in just 10 years, and that the primary driver of this decline is climate change. This obviously isn’t good news. Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine species despite occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor. They also provide food, income and storm protection to over one billion people. In total, they provide benefits worth over US$375 billion each year. If we lose coral reefs, it won’t just be a biodiversity crisis—it will also be a humanitarian and economic crisis.  As all eyes turn to the   this month, we have to ask: will this be the year we finally commit to saving these valuable ecosystems? Climate change is here, and it’s only going to get worse. But despite these dire reports, humanity has a critical window of time for action. And we know this because our research shows that we still have time to save coral reefs. We have spent the last five years of our careers as coral reef scientists investigating the best ways to protect coral reefs from the global changes coming their way, like warming ocean temperatures. We built sophisticated mathematical models to understand how and whether reefs can survive. Our results show that there is hope for coral reefs: they can adapt to cope with a warmer world, but only if we act quickly.  To give corals the best chance of adaptation, two things must happen: 1) we need to reduce local human impacts on reefs like overfishing and pollution; and 2) we must rapidly slow and then stop climate change.  Countless communities, nonprofit organizations and governments are doing their very best to reduce local stressors to reefs. They are improving water quality, reducing overfishing, and combating land-based pollution.  At the  , we have seen the community in West End, Roatán in Honduras galvanize their resources to get a wastewater treatment plant up and running. The result has been a 99% reduction in bacteria in nearshore waters, not only making the ocean cleaner for coral reefs, but also making it more sanitary for the people who swim and fish in those waters. In Hawai’i, over 100 community volunteers have come together to keep 25 tons of sediment off the coral reefs of West Maui by reforesting degraded landscapes with native plants.  The communities that depend on coral reefs the most are doing what they can to protect their livelihoods and their homes. And while these efforts are critically important, they will ultimately be in vain if our global leaders don’t take immediate action to reduce the amount of warming that our world is on track to experience.   We need to reduce emissions, and we need to do it now. This can only be accomplished through coordinated international efforts.  If we commit to reducing carbon emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, science indicates that corals can adapt to a warmer world. To achieve this requires immediate and dramatic global action. There is no time to waste. If COP26 in Glasgow results in real promises that lead to real change, then we still have time to avert the extinction of one of the world’s most important ecosystems.  But if we continue on our current emissions trajectory, it is going to be very difficult if not impossible for corals—and many other species—to adapt quickly enough. That’s why we, as coral reef scientists who care deeply about what’s at stake, join faith leaders, health professionals, community members and business stakeholders in calling on world leaders to set ambitious targets to lower emissions and translate that commitment to action. If we act now, there is still hope for coral reefs and the billion people who depend on them. But if we don’t, we’re looking at a much more difficult and treacherous road ahead.  Madhavi Colton, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Coral Reef Alliance Helen Fox, Ph.D., Conservation Science Director of the Coral Reef Alliance Lisa McManus, Ph.D., Assistant Research Professor at the Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology at University of Hawai’i at Manoa Malin Pinsky, Ph.D., Associate Professor and Director of the Graduate Program in Ecology & Evolution at Rutgers University"

This annual event, conceived as a heartfelt thank-you to our generous donors, took on a new dimension in light of recent events and became a profound benefit for a vital cause. As the sun set, guests gathered at the stunning Pacific Club to embark on an evening of enchanting music and camaraderie. The event kicked off with a delightful spread of pūpūs, featuring a medley of mouthwatering appetizers inspired by Hawaiian cuisine. Amidst the laughter and mingling, we took a moment to share a little about our work and the purpose behind Music on the Reef. The event was initially intended as an expression of our gratitude to our donors, but due to the devastating wildfires in Maui, it gained a new purpose. The wildfires in Maui served as a stark reminder of the challenges our beloved islands face due to climate change. In response, we launched the Community Resilience Fund, a testament to our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our natural treasures and the communities who rely on them. These underwater marvels, coral reefs, are the lifeblood of our oceans and a cornerstone of Hawaii’s vibrant ecosystem. The loss in Lahaina served as a wake-up call to many, including our organization. One of our program staff was directly impacted in a life-changing way, and at that moment, we knew we needed to be prepared for more major disasters as climate change ramps up. Enter the Community Resilience Fund, which we officially kicked off on September 14th at Music on the Reef. Major weather events, due to climate change, are realities we cannot ignore. It’s a menace that threatens not just our musical harmony but the very existence of the coral reefs that inspired this event. Coral reefs are the backbone of our marine ecosystems, nurturing a wealth of biodiversity and supporting our fisheries. Protecting them is not just an environmental imperative; it’s a duty we owe to future generations. In response to climate change, we are securing funds for coastal communities just like Lahaina. Through research, conservation initiatives, and community engagement, we are committed to ensuring the people who protect our underwater wonders endure for generations to come. With the crowd’s spirits lifted and hearts warmed, it was time for the main event—a concert that transported everyone to a world of musical enchantment. The stage was graced by a lineup of extraordinary musicians, featuring the incomparable Josh Nakazawa on cello and the legendary Jake Shimabukuro (ukulele), our CORAL ambassadors, alongside world class virtuosos–concertmaster for the Hawaiian Symphony Orchestra, Ignance Jang (violin), Shawn Conley (bass), Megan Conley (harp), Jasmine Nagano (piano), Natalie Mitchell (voice), Kevin Chang (voice), and Jackson Waldhoff (electric bass). All played with heartfelt intensity and artistry, which captivated everyone. The ensemble featured an array of instruments, from strings to keys, chilling vocals, and the soulful strumming of ukuleles. The synergy between these diverse sounds created a mesmerizing fusion of melodies that resonated with the very essence of Hawaii’s rich cultural tapestry. As the last note hung in the air and the crowd erupted in applause, it was evident that the evening had left a lasting impact. Beyond the musical celebration, Music on the Reef was a clarion call to action. What makes events like this even more remarkable is the unwavering support of the Hawaiian community. Time and again, we have witnessed resilience and determination when it comes to safeguarding our natural treasures. We are immensely grateful for their continued support, and it serves as a testament to our shared dedication to fighting for our coral reefs’ future. The second edition of Music on the Reef was a resounding success, both in terms of musical splendor and its impact on our collective consciousness. As we look ahead to future editions of this event, we do so with a renewed commitment to the cause and a profound sense of gratitude for everyone who joined us on this journey. To all our donors, supporters, and the entire Hawaii community, we say mahalo nui loa. Together, we will continue to harmonize for a sustainable future where our coral reefs thrive, and the melodies of Music on the Reef continue to enchant generations to come."

        "content": "(OAKLAND, CA – November 10, 2023) Today, a consortium of universities, development agencies, and NGOs announced the launch of Climate REEFS, a collaborative project to advance socially equitable climate change adaptation for coastal communities that depend on coral reef resources in Indonesia and the Philippines. Climate REEFS is a project under the UK-Canada   research framework programme and the UK Blue Planet Fund’s Climate and Ocean Adaptation and Sustainable Transition (COAST) programme. Partners include   (Indonesia), the  , and the international NGOs   and the   (CORAL). According to a  , an additional 68 to 135 million people could be pushed into poverty by 2030 because of climate change. As more frequent marine heatwaves endanger the livelihoods and food security of about 1 billion people globally who benefit from coral reef ecosystems, evidence-based adaptation strategies are paramount to ensuring biodiversity protection and sustainable use. Currently, management approaches mostly target reefs less exposed to heat stress but ignore biological and social adaptation that can reduce the risks that climate change poses to sustainable ocean livelihoods. Climate REEFS will help solve this problem by identifying adaptive reefs from space and by characterizing the social vulnerabilities of different stakeholders, particularly women and marginalized groups. The project will quantify how reef structure predicts species and genetic diversity, which likely links to a reef’s capacity to adapt to climate change. It also aims to develop socially equitable, context-specific climate adaptation pathways. “Climate REEFS will implement social research to identify the climate vulnerability of coastal communities together with gender and socially inclusive adaptation pathways, geospatial research to detect adaptive reefs from satellite-derived data, and ecological and genomic research to pilot an analysis that tests the interplay of climate change-adaptiveness from genes to people,” said  , University of Leeds, and lead PI of the project.  “The impacts of climate change are not felt evenly across genders and geographies. It is particularly important to understand how degraded coral reefs are impacting women and other marginalized groups in the Asia Pacific so we can design climate adaptation strategies that support all members of a community,” said  , Managing Director of Rare’s Fish Forever program. The project aims to work both on local and national levels towards sustainable climate-smart coastal fishing livelihoods. “Climate REEFS will help people in the village get information on the health of their reefs, how they are used, and help develop policies about their future use. Most fishers never see the reef so they don’t realise their impact,” said  , Director of Maritime and Marine Science Center of Excellence at the Pattimura University. “It is exciting to have this multi-disciplinary team coming together to conduct innovative research that will inform policy and management as well as strengthen science capacity in Indonesia and the Philippines,” said  , Conservation Science Director of the Coral Reef Alliance.   Climate REEFS is part of CLARE’s first cohort of projects. CLARE is a £110m, UK-Canada framework research programme on Climate Adaptation and Resilience, aiming to enable socially inclusive and sustainable action to build resilience to climate change and natural hazards. CLARE is an initiative jointly designed and run by the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office and Canada’s International Development Research Centre. CLARE is primarily funded by UK aid from the UK government, along with the International Development Research Centre, Canada.  The project is also funded through FCDO’s £154m COAST programme, which is part of the UK’s £500m Blue Planet Fund portfolio. COAST aims to support climate change adaptation and more prosperous, sustainable, and resilient coastal economies, focusing on protecting and restoring coastal habitats, strengthening the sustainability and climate resilience of small-scale fisheries, unlocking more sustainable aquaculture production, and driving inclusive coastal governance and planning.

        "content": "In a heartbreaking turn of events, two large coral reefs off the coast of Honduras as well as other reefs in the Caribbean have fallen victim to the destructive forces of coral bleaching, a consequence of warming waters due to climate change. The catastrophic damage of these vibrant and biodiverse ecosystems underscores the urgent need for immediate action to protect and restore our oceans. The dangerous combination of rising ocean temperatures and poor water quality has led to widespread  , presenting significant challenges to Cordelia Banks, a protected area off the SouthWest coast of Roatan in the Bay Islands, as well as Capiro in Tela off the North coast of Honduras. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing the loss of their vibrant colors and weakening their ability to survive. Corals can bounce back from bleaching events, especially if they are healthy and the environmental stressors are alleviated in time. These once-thriving reefs, teeming with life and biodiversity, now highlight the pressing challenges climate change poses to our planet’s delicate ecosystems. The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and our partners stand at the forefront of the battle, leveraging 30 years of expertise and unwavering commitment to coral reef conservation. Together, we’re dedicated to not only addressing these challenges but also to revitalizing and restoring the vibrancy and biodiversity of these essential marine habitats. With our commitment to preserving these underwater wonders, CORAL emphasizes the importance of acting swiftly to prevent further damage to neighboring reefs. Our team and partners focus heavily on reducing stressors to the reef, including securing clean water and implementing sustainable fishing practices, to give corals a better chance of survival in warming waters. I’ve lived alongside these reefs most of my life, so to see this devastation first-hand is heartbreaking. We need all hands on deck to swiftly reduce local threats to allow coral reefs to adapt to climate change. The most important local actions needed are to eliminate sewage pollution, increase protection, and implement effective management measures to restore the ecosystem so it can adapt to more challenges ahead. Now, more than ever, we call on individuals and organizations to   and accelerate the expansion of our efforts to reduce threats of wastewater pollution in Tela, Coxen Hole, and other emblematic sites across the Western Caribbean. The time to act is now, as we witness first-hand the window of opportunity to safeguard these precious ecosystems rapidly closing. First and foremost, our focus is on understanding the full impact. We’ve partnered with the Healthy Reefs Initiative (HRI) to apply the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) for past studies and will join forces with them again to assess the ecological impacts and reef health monitoring in emblematic sites across the Mesoamerican Region. We’re also delving into the social and economic impacts, exploring potential partnerships to broaden our insights. When it comes to interventions, we’re identifying both short-term and long-term solutions, such as promoting sustainable tourism best practices to reduce pressure, supporting sustainable fisheries, and effective enforcement within the MPAs, as well as collaborating closely with the Bay Islands National Marine Park Technical Committee (BINMP-TC) and the Tela Inter-Institutional Environmental and Protected Areas Committee (CIAT) to continue assessing the situation and planning joint next steps. Communication is key. We’re keeping decision-makers and local communities in the loop with briefings and clear information. Feedback from our team on the ground and in the water will be critical to sharing updates. Once we’ve assessed the situation, we’ll enact next steps to maximize resilience. This will include more effective management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), like providing technical assistance to local stakeholders, capacity building, and funding MPA co-managers to implement their critical programs. On the local front, we’re teaming up with partners like The Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA) and Tela Reef Friend’s Association (AMATELA) to tackle local sanitation issues through water quality monitoring. We are working alongside local organizations in creating budgets and fundraising to make sanitation management models a reality. The goal is to have these models adapted to different coral reef communities around the world. Tools to replicate these adaptable and scalable management models will be publicly available this summer. Click here to be notified when this toolkit is available. (link to a sign-up page) And, of course, we can’t forget about the reefs themselves. Simultaneously, we’re supporting the enforcement of MPA regulations and safeguarding fisheries by partnering with the Roatan Marine Park (RMP) and the Foundation for the Protection of Lancetilla, Punta Sal and Texiguat (PROLANSATE) to ramp up patrols. RMP and Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA), lead efforts to identify restoration methods for the damaged reefs, which complement our priorities to address wastewater and fisheries. Collectively we’re actively looking into what research is needed to ensure we’re making all the right moves. Collaborating with experts to fill information gaps related to sanitation, coral health, and water quality is a priority. We’re building capacity for MPA co-managers, ensuring we have the knowledge and skills needed for effective conservation. Our work isn’t limited to reacting to the current threats; we’re working diligently to shape a resilient future for our coral reefs and the communities that depend on them. Your support is pivotal in turning these plans into action. So what can you do? To make a global impact, think local. Support local initiatives and conservation organizations, adjust your daily habits to include more sustainable practices, and keep learning. Then turn that knowledge into practice. Together, we can safeguard our oceans and leave a legacy of thriving marine ecosystems for generations to come."

Let’s talk about what this means and what’s next. As global temperatures continue to rise, marine heatwaves have become more frequent and severe, subjecting coral reefs to prolonged stress. The result is widespread  , a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to their stark white appearance and eventual death if the stress persists. This fourth global bleaching event is a glaring reminder of the urgent need for decisive action to combat a warming planet and help coral reefs adapt to climate change.  If there was ever a time to roll up your sleeves and get involved in this fight,   We must take immediate action to lessen further damage to coral reefs while they’re in this vulnerable state.  The CORAL team worked together to launch the   last summer. This toolkit provides essential resources and strategies to aid in conservation efforts surrounding a bleaching event. A recent update includes more remote sensing and on-site monitoring resources and introduces a section dedicated to online apps. As we face mass coral bleaching, we hope that the update of our Toolkit and Guide provides a timely compilation of resources of what can be done before, during, and after a bleaching event, and galvanizes support for these amazing ecosystems. The toolkit contains actionable guidelines for reporting bleaching events, monitoring reef health, and implementing best practices for tourism sites to minimize additional stress on coral ecosystems. By following these guidelines and taking proactive measures, we are helping reduce stressors to coral reefs to minimize the devastating impacts of bleaching on marine biodiversity.  Coral bleaching demands urgent global collaboration to highlight its severity and drive better policies. This Toolkit consolidates information from diverse organizations working on coral bleaching into one accessible resource. Now, urgent steps are needed to integrate these efforts and datasets to ensure unified communication. In addition to providing guidance and resources, like the coral bleaching toolkit and water quality monitoring protocol, all members of the CORAL team are committed to the collective action of our alliance and partnerships, especially supporting local efforts on the ground and in the water. As our conservation science work has shown, corals can adapt to climate change…if we help them. Our team is working diligently toward   in coastal communities so coral reefs have a fighting chance in this warming world. During these critical times of bleaching, we’re working closely with our partners to assess the evolving situation and provide necessary resources and funding for monitoring efforts and studies. In our 30 years of coral conservation, we know   More specifically, this includes sharing replicable models to empower coastal communities near priority reefs to take control of their wastewater treatment and fishing practices. It also includes education around sustainable tourism and augmenting ocean literacy, particularly for youths. As we sit on the cusp of this fourth global bleaching event –   – we’re reminded of the urgent need for bold and decisive action to protect coral reefs from the consequences of coral bleaching, as well as addressing the root cause: climate change. Corals will not survive for generations to come unless rising carbon emissions are tackled with intention.  We must come together as a global community to protect and preserve these invaluable ecosystems. By leveraging the power of science, innovation, and collective action, we can alter the grim trajectory we’re on and reposition coral reefs toward a more sustainable future. As part of the CORAL community, we must continuously reinforce that action is the best remedy for despair.  For all media inquiries, please contact Kate at  ."

        "content": "Coral reefs, rainforests of the sea, are magnificent and diverse ecosystems teeming with life. Within this underwater wonderland,   Remarkable creatures like parrotfish and surgeonfish serve as nature’s custodians, diligently preserving the health of coral reefs by curbing the growth of algae, which, if left unchecked, can pose significant threats to the entire ecosystem. Among the many herbivorous fish species, parrotfish and surgeonfish stand out for their remarkable contributions.  Parrotfish, in particular, exhibit a fascinating life cycle. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, beginning their lives as females and later transitioning into males as they grow and environmental factors change. (What?!) Living in harems, where one dominant male controls a group of females, parrotfish are essential for maintaining the delicate balance within the group. If the alpha male is removed, it takes several months for a female to transition into the male role, impacting the reproductive cycle of the school. Surgeonfish, with their distinctive spines and vibrant colors, are another vital component of coral reef ecosystems.   These herbivorous fish species, with their unique traits and behaviors, contribute significantly to the overall resilience of coral reefs. , constantly feeding on algae that grow on coral reefs. Algae, when left uncontrolled, can outcompete corals for space and sunlight, eventually smothering them. By  , herbivore fish help to maintain the growth and vitality of corals, ensuring the reef ecosystem thrives. Moreover, some herbivores, like parrotfish, also aid in coral growth by  . This seemingly destructive behavior promotes the development of new polyps,  . These natural processes, guided by the activities of herbivorous fish, are essential for the overall health and biodiversity of coral reefs. While herbivore fish are indispensable guardians of coral reefs, their populations face numerous threats, with overfishing being one of the most pressing concerns.  disrupts the natural balance within herbivore communities, leading to a decrease in their numbers. When these essential fish are overharvested, the algae they would have consumed takes over. As a result, corals become vulnerable, facing increased competition for space and sunlight, and are more susceptible to diseases. The  , impacting not only the herbivore fish but also the corals, other marine life, and, ultimately, the communities that depend on these reefs for their livelihoods. , including agricultural runoff, plastic waste, and chemicals, can contaminate the water, disrupting the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem. Prolonged exposure to pollutants weakens the immunity of corals and herbivore fish, making them more susceptible to diseases and other stressors.  Rising sea temperatures due to global warming cause  , a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leaving them vulnerable and colorless.  , another consequence of climate change, hampers the ability of corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, making them weaker and more susceptible to damage. What makes these threats particularly concerning is their interconnected nature. Overfishing weakens herbivore fish populations, making them less resilient to other stressors such as pollution and climate change. Likewise, the impacts of pollution and climate change, such as coral bleaching and weakened corals, create additional challenges for herbivore fish by reducing the availability of suitable habitats and food sources. Addressing these threats requires a comprehensive approach that involves sustainable fisheries management, reducing pollution, and mitigating climate change. Conservation efforts, such as those championed by organizations like Fishpono, are instrumental in raising awareness, conducting research, and implementing initiatives to protect herbivore fish populations and coral reefs. Together, through collective action and a shared commitment to marine conservation, we can ensure that herbivore fish continue their vital role as guardians of coral reefs, preserving these magnificent underwater ecosystems for generations to come. Here’s to a future where the unsung heroes of the coral reefs thrive, and the reefs themselves continue to enchant and inspire us all."

        "content": "In the conservation and nonprofit sector, we throw around a lot of acronyms.  To our team, none are more important than “MPA” – a marine protected area. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designated areas of the ocean that are set aside for conservation and management purposes. These areas are intended to preserve and protect the marine life and their habitats within them. They also promote sustainable use of these resources. By establishing MPAs, we can ensure that our oceans remain healthy and full of life for future generations to come. Research has shown that MPAs can significantly improve carbon sequestration, coastal protection, biodiversity and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms, as well as the catches and income of fishers. But, efficacy matters. Why are MPAs so important to our mission, you ask? They can be as effective as national parks for areas of preserved land.  But only if they are truly managed effectively.  What we don’t want is “paper parks” – parks that are established but then lack sufficient management and enforcement of regulations and conservation plans.  Any park can look good on paper but an effective MPA takes the work of many nonprofits, local governments, and community stakeholders. In the Western Caribbean, CORAL is working hard to reduce local threats to coral reefs within marine protected areas (MPAs) and to construct regional collaborations that facilitate better protection and regulation of these ocean zones. MPAs are critical if we want vital ecological entities like the Mesoamerican Reef System (MAR) – which stretches 625 miles along the coast of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras and is the largest reef network in the western hemisphere – to recover and heal from damages caused by  , land-based pollution and unsustainable tourism. To give corals the best chance for adapting to climate change, CORAL focuses on what is putting them at risk, including improving MPA governance in Honduras, Belize and Mexico. But, why do MPAs matter? Firstly, MPAs provide a sanctuary for marine species. With over 90% of the world’s fish stocks either fully fished or overfished, it is essential to protect the habitats and breeding grounds of marine species to ensure their survival. Fully and highly protected MPAs create safe spaces where fish populations can thrive, reproduce, and grow in numbers. In turn, this supports the larger oceanic ecosystem. MPAs help to ensure the long-term sustainability of our oceans and the fish that depend on them. Secondly, MPAs help to  . The oceans are home to an incredible variety of life, from tiny plankton to massive whales, and everything in between. MPAs help to preserve this biodiversity by providing a range of habitats for different species. By protecting different types of habitats, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, and kelp forests, MPAs ensure that a diverse range of marine life can continue to exist in our oceans. Thirdly, MPAs  . Many coastal communities around the world depend on fishing for their livelihoods. MPAs provide a way to manage and sustainably use these resources, ensuring that fish populations do not become depleted, and fishing can continue for generations to come. MPAs can also attract tourists, providing a source of income for local economies and creating jobs in areas such as eco-tourism and marine research. By working together to establish and manage MPAs, we can create a brighter future for our oceans and the people and animals that depend on them. So, let’s join forces and protect our oceans – together, we can make a difference!"

But increased popularity means many of the natural resources in these locations are in need of protection. That’s where a Destination Management Organization (DMO) comes into play.  A DMO is a body that manages all aspects of a tourism destination. It protects nature and the area’s cultural heritage, while also maintaining its appeal to travelers. The organization brings together government, civil society, and industry stakeholders to secure funding, protect the area’s natural environments, and simultaneously boost its economy.  Here at CORAL, we are actively involved in the development and maintenance of a DMO in Cozumel, which is only the second DMO created in Mexico. Due to the area’s lively coral reefs and a local economy reliant on them, Cozumel is an important destination to protect and a DMO will help us in that process.  Cozumel’s coral reefs are part of the Mesoamerican Reef, which is the second largest barrier reef on the planet. But in the last two years, environmental factors impacting coral reefs, like   and  , along with the devastating effects of the pandemic, have led to a significant decline in Cozumel’s tourism, an industry that accounts for 85 percent of jobs on the island. “Cozumel will only stay a viable destination if we keep its natural environment healthy,” says Javier Pizaña-Alonso, CORAL’s Program Manager in Mexico and the local DMO’s president. “That’s why it is so important that we focus our efforts on protection—especially the protection of coral reefs.”  Cozumel’s DMO is part of a bigger initiative led by our partner,  .  Together, we are uniting the Caribbean’s three major cruise destinations: Cozumel, Roatan, and Belize, in order to preserve Mesoamerica’s natural and cultural heritage. Each destination is developing their own DMO and is working with different sectors to meet sustainability goals and initiatives.  “A priority of these DMOs is to protect all natural environments, including the Mesoamerican Reef” says Pizaña-Alonso. “In Cozumel, the DMO will keep its corals healthy by implementing initiatives focused on waste management, water and sanitation, and climate change.” In order to fulfill long-term conservation initiatives, Pizaña-Alonso is building an ongoing relationship with the local government.  According to Pizaña-Alonso, it is important that members of the local government want to be involved in the DMO, as it makes it much easier to secure the funds needed to support coral reef conservation. “Around the world, successful DMOs that improved the sustainable tourism dynamic were all supported by the local government and private sector,” says Pizaña-Alonso.  This can be challenging when newly elected officials come into power; however, Pizaña-Alonso is thrilled to announce that Cozumel’s DMO is one of few local projects that has succeeded across multiple administrations.  Through a coordinated approach to sustainable tourism, we are optimistic that we can keep Cozumel’s coral reefs healthy and thriving, which in turn supports the many marine animals and people that are dependent on them. "

        "content": "Could a map be used to estimate the likelihood that a coral reef can adapt to climate change? That’s one of the biggest questions driving our Global Conservation Science team these days. In collaboration with the  , a global map and monitoring system for shallow water coral reefs, we are leading new, cutting-edge research to determine the Atlas’s ability to identify which reefs are more likely to be able to adapt to climate change.  CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, Dr. Helen Fox, is spearheading the initiative and working with researchers at the University of Miami and an independent postdoc.  The Atlas consists of different data layers that online users can turn on or off to view characteristics of a reef, like bottom type and reef structure, which is mapped from imagery detected by satellites in space, and then ground-truthed by local scientists around the world.  Scientists, including Fox, predict—and are working to prove—that the areas shown by the Atlas to have a wide range of diversity in reef type and structure correlate to a high range of temperatures on a reef. This would likely mean greater genetic diversity of corals. If that’s the case, then the Atlas could be used to predict which reefs have a higher potential of adapting to climate change.  Around the world, coral reefs are suffering from the impacts of warming ocean temperatures—which is the cause of mass bleaching events and the loss of 14 percent of the planet’s corals in the last decade. But research has shown that some corals can adapt to these higher temperatures. It is important to reduce human impacts in these “hot reef” areas so those heat-adapted corals can reproduce and spread their genes. “As the oceans warm, we are hoping there are some corals that can survive the warming waters,” says Fox. “We then want those corals to reproduce, so they build future generations of coral that are also able to tolerate warmer temperatures.”    If Fox and her team determine that the Atlas can, in fact, be used to estimate a reef’s adaptation potential, the next step will be to use this data layer during marine spatial planning. That would give decision-makers the information needed to help prioritize protections for coral reefs that have a higher potential of adapting to future ocean conditions.  Many countries and coastal regions are already setting goals to increase the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) in their waters. Some areas, like Hawai’i, have pledged to protect at least 30 percent of its coral reefs with MPAs by 2030. Those MPAs could be even more effective if they include coral reefs that could help spread adaptive traits to other coral reefs.   “We are fighting to protect an incredibly valuable marine ecosystem,” says Fox. “The loss of coral reefs will be devastating for the ocean, as well as for coastal communities that rely on them for food and income.”  Since launching last year, the Atlas   in many parts of the world. From Mozambique to Sri Lanka to the Bahamas, the map has supported research and improved planning strategies, in the hopes of ultimately helping preserve the health of coral reefs.  Our work to better understand which coral reefs have a higher potential of adapting to climate change will ultimately benefit these many conservation efforts. According to Fox, acting now is essential as the fate of coral reefs will likely be decided in the next 25 years. "

        "content": "By: Ben Charo, Conservation Science Program Coordinator  If we don’t curb greenhouse gas emissions and slow the warming of our oceans, 99% of the world’s coral reefs are predicted to be gone by the end of this century. Indeed, reefs are already in  . So it might surprise you to hear that within the next few hundred years, corals could adapt, rebound, and survive if given the chance to evolve. The key? Genetic variation.  Genetic variation is the fuel of evolution. It’s also a big part of what makes every individual organism on this planet unique. Even the slightest genetic differences can lead to discrepancies in height, eye color, the probability of contracting diseases, and other distinctions. Organisms with genes that are best adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, sending their unique genetic code on to the next generation. This process is known as  . Over multiple generations of natural selection, species can begin to display new traits and characteristics—you’ve likely heard this referred to as evolution.  It stands to reason that the more genetically diverse a population of organisms is, the more diverse its pool of individuals will be, and the more likely that some of those individuals will be able to adapt to whatever circumstances arise. It’s this idea that is essential to coral reefs surviving the heat stress created by climate change.  In an article published in  last year, CORAL team members and partners confirmed that genetically diverse coral reef networks were much more likely to survive warming waters than their less diverse counterparts. The graph (Figure 1a from the paper) illustrates a number of simulations run for the Caribbean region. In the graph, RCP8.5 represents a high-greenhouse gas emissions scenario (leading to a warmer planet and warmer oceans), while in RCP4.5, emissions are stabilized. You’ll notice that corals without genetic variability (V = 0) were wiped out completely with high emissions and barely survived with low emissions. Corals with moderate variability (V = .01) were able to recover in a cooler climate scenario, but perished under the high-emissions scenario. And corals with high variability (V = 0.1) survived regardless of climate circumstances.  When these simulations were run on coral reefs in other regions across the globe, corals behaved very similarly. The key takeaways: 1) genetic variability is critical to coral reef survival, and 2) we must meet corals halfway by acting urgently to reduce emissions. Our research also found that genetic connections  coral reefs were crucial to their prospects. When corals reproduce, their larvae move with ocean currents and can be carried along to other reefs, where they settle and grow. That means coral reefs are genetically connected to one another through flows of larvae from reef to reef. According to our research, coral reefs that received larger amounts of larvae from other reefs were more likely to survive the effects of climate change than those that received fewer. This was especially true for reefs in colder water that received heat-adapted larvae from hotter reefs. In short, preserving genetic variability is important, but so is promoting genetic exchange, especially from reefs that are already adapted to high temperatures.  These findings present us with a few key implications for how we can help corals survive warming oceans. First, we must reduce carbon emissions and slow the rate of climate change to give corals a fighting chance. National governments in countries that   for global carbon emissions must bear the brunt of this work, but individuals can make a difference as well. Second, we must protect a diversity of reefs that are themselves genetically diverse. Doing so increases the odds that heat-adapted individuals will be present and naturally selected. Third, we can’t just protect individual patches of reef; we must ensure that reefs are protected in connected networks to allow the exchange of genes. And finally, we must pay particular attention to the presence of hot reefs in these networks, which should allow heat-adapted larvae to spread to other reefs.  There’s one last piece of the puzzle to coral reef survival: reducing additional pressure from local stressors. When confronted with threats, such as   or  , reefs are less likely to recover from coral bleaching events. We must make sure corals aren’t hit from multiple angles at once by tackling these issues.  Through global conservation science and locally-based efforts, CORAL is leading the charge on making this vision for coral reef survival a reality. In Hawai’i and the Mesoamerican Reef region, our conservation teams are improving water quality, protecting reefs from overfishing, and eliminating as much additional pressure on these ecosystems as possible so they’re able to withstand the threat of climate change.  Meanwhile, our Global Conservation Science team is turning this science into action by influencing and leveraging partners, fieldwork, and technology to drive adaptation-focused conservation solutions that will rescue coral reefs from the effects of climate change. Our approach consists of three main pillars:  If you’re a coral reef conservation practitioner, we hope you’ll consider the principles described above as you approach reef protection. And, no matter who you are, we hope you’ll use your voice to advocate for climate-smart policies, and invest in CORAL’s groundbreaking work to save coral reefs.

        "date": null,
        "category": null,
        "content": "In many scientific communities, “coral restoration” refers to the act of growing corals and then planting them in the wild. While it’s an incredibly popular method of coral reef conservation, research has shown that if done alone, the act of growing and planting corals is unlikely to save coral reefs. For starters, it only works if local threats to coral reefs are reduced. If corals are planted in an area where existing corals are already threatened by wastewater pollution or overfishing, then the newly planted corals don’t have a high chance of survival. Climate change is another concern—as ocean temperatures warm, corals that aren’t heat tolerant will have a harder time surviving. In some situations, scientists and conservationists focus just on planting coral species that are more heat tolerant. But that can be inherently risky, because it means that we as humans are picking the species that we believe will be better suited for future conditions, when we don’t know with certainty what those future conditions will be. In some situations, corals can be bred to be more heat tolerant—these are sometimes called “super corals.” While this sounds promising,   that we collaborated on  in order for these types of outplanting projects to be effective at protecting corals from climate change, they would need to be done at a large scale for hundreds of years in conjunction with efforts to reduce local threats to coral reefs. That’s not to say that growing corals and planting them in the wild isn’t worthwhile—it can be a great way to repopulate an area after a storm or boat anchor damage, for example. It can also be helpful in engaging communities and tourists, and bringing more awareness to the plight of coral reefs. In fact, a lot of our partners engage in coral planting and have found it to yield promising results when combined with reducing local threats to reefs. Outside of specific scientific and conservation communities, the term “restoration” refers to reverting something to its original or natural state. When it comes to coral reefs, that is definitely something we do—and it’s a practice that can save coral reefs. Our programs that focus on securing clean water for reefs and addressing overfishing aim to restore coral reefs to a more natural, healthier state and protect them from human impacts. And our research shows that when we restore coral reefs in this way, they can adapt to climate change on their own—without too much human interference. What does this kind of restoration look like on the ground? It looks like   in Honduras, where we helped the community operationalize a wastewater treatment plant and as a result saw the amount of coral disease drop from 25 percent to zero percent. It looks like   where over 100 volunteers have restored a section of dirt roads by using native plants to trap sediment runoff and keep it off coral reefs. And it looks like  , where we’ve seen a 483 percent increase in fish biomass after partnering with communities to build sustainable fisheries. All of these efforts help restore coral reefs back to a healthier state, where they not only have a better chance of adapting to climate change, but are also more resilient to disease, storm damage, bleaching, and more. There are two parts to this: the first is curbing our carbon emissions to reduce the rate of climate change. There are a lot of great organizations working in this space and advancing initiatives around clean energy, sustainable production, and more. While we still have a long way to go to truly solve the climate crisis, the fact that we are seeing these conversations and this work more amplified than ever before gives us hope. We’re also doing our part by joining public calls to action, sitting on global committees to influence governments that make climate decisions, and using our position as scientists and conservationists to build more awareness around the urgency of climate action. The second part is what we focus on at CORAL: building networks of healthy, adaptive coral reefs. We know that coral larvae can travel for miles before ultimately settling on a reef. We also know that some corals have adapted to become more heat tolerant than others. Therefore, we reduce local threats where corals are already more heat tolerant and in places where their babies are settling, which allows corals to spread their heat-tolerant genes and ultimately change the overall makeup of some coral reefs to become more heat tolerant. So yes, coral restoration that focuses on reducing human impacts and reverting corals back to a healthier, less threatened state can save coral reefs. And in some cases, coral planting to supplement those efforts might make sense, particularly in places where threats have already been addressed."

Our volunteers grow and plant native vegetation at key locations near coastal streams, which act as natural barriers and trap sediment runoff before it reaches the ocean and coral reefs. One of our most supportive volunteers is Blake, an island local born and raised in Makawao, Maui. He has been working with CORAL for the last two years, participating as a lead volunteer in planting events and assisting with data collection. Saving coral reefs is important to Blake because of the food they provide for the people of Hawai’i and their cultural value. He believes that the ocean takes care of the land and it’s our duty to care for corals in return.  Thanks to your generous donation in 2021, volunteers like Blake can continue to protect the coral reefs in Hawai’i.  "

On April 22, more than one billion people will mobilize and advocate to protect our planet’s beautiful resources, animals, and ecosystems. At CORAL, we are committed to saving one of the most important ocean environments: coral reefs.  Coral reefs are both animals and ecosystems, and they add so much value to our planet. They act as home to more than a million marine species, give protection to coastal areas, and support countless people with food and income.  But coral reefs are in trouble. In fact, we’ve lost at least 14 percent of the world’s reefs in the last decade alone. That’s why we are fighting so hard to reduce environmental threats and keep coral reefs healthy. On April 22, you can stand with our alliance by spreading the word about coral reef conservation and taking actions that protect these valuable ecosystems.  Here are six simple ways you can protect coral reefs on Earth Day It’s hard to protect coral reefs if you aren’t sure what’s threatening them. Spend your Earth Day   to coral reefs and what can be done to reduce this stress. At CORAL, we focus on minimizing overfishing and water pollution—two major problems that can ultimately devastate a reef. Without healthy fish populations, algae can take over an ocean environment and make it harder for coral reefs to grow. And if the water is polluted with waste, marine debris, or runoff sediment, it spreads harmful chemicals and can spur the growth of algae.   to learn more about threats to coral reefs and how you can help protect them.  Planning a summer vacation? Make your plans with the environment in mind! There are plenty of easy ways to make your trip more eco-friendly, like committing to “leave no trace” on the beach or reducing your use of plastic and single-use materials. You can also make a conscious choice to stay at sustainable lodging and support local businesses when visiting a location.  Check out our   for more tips on how to protect coral reefs during your next vacation. Climate change might be one of the biggest existential threats the world is facing—and may determine the fate of our reefs if we don’t make a change. Ocean waters are warming, which increases the likelihood of coral bleaching events. Research shows that coral reefs can adapt to some rising temperatures, but only if we slow down our CO2 emissions.   There are  —including driving less, reducing your meat consumption, buying local, recycling, using less energy at home, and more. And most importantly,   to take bigger steps to reduce worldwide emissions.  Did you know an estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen is deposited into the ocean annually? Worst of all, much of that sunscreen brings harmful chemicals that affect corals’ reproductive cycle, damage DNA, and worsen the effects of coral bleaching. Keep reefs healthy by using mineral sunscreen with non-nano Titanium Dioxide or Zinc Oxide as the active ingredient. And don’t just use it at the beach—sunscreen can easily spread through our waterways and enter our oceans, even if you’re far from the water. To learn more,  If we are going to make a real change, the message needs to be widespread. Use Earth Day as an opportunity to teach somebody else why they should care about saving coral reefs.  Share our  or encourage a friend or family member to follow us on   or   to learn more about coral reef ecosystems. Lastly, you can save coral reefs by directly supporting programs that keep them healthy and thriving.  , you will minimize overfishing, reduce ocean pollution, invest in cutting-edge science and research, and support coastal communities with the skills and resources needed to protect their reefs.  Best of all, from now until April 22, you can double your impact with our special Earth Day match: thanks to our partners at Gili Sports, all donations up to $15,000 will be matched 1:1.

This partnership offers an opportunity to take steps toward reducing water pollution and expanding sustainable tourism programs that protect Belize’s coral reefs.  One of our long-term projects in Belize is setting the foundation for the construction of a wastewater treatment system in Caye Caulker, a small island off the coast of Belize City. This could help ensure coral reefs have the clean water they need, similar to what we achieved in West End, Honduras. By partnering with the local community in West End, we operationalized a wastewater treatment system which decreased the amount of bacteria in nearshore waters by more than 99 percent between 2013 and 2020.  The project was so successful that the community in Caye Caulker is now interested in collaborating on a similar initiative. The island shares similarities to where we’ve worked in Honduras, in addition to having valuable coral reefs that offer food and economic opportunities to the local community.  Right now, poor water quality from an inadequate wastewater treatment system threatens the health of coral reefs, surrounding marine animals, and people in Caye Caulker. By advancing this project, we will begin to implement a better system that benefits both the community and its reefs. Additionally, we are promoting sustainable tourism opportunities in and around Belize City, which will help protect the area’s natural resources and build a culture that prioritizes the environment.  “We are reshaping the perception of tourism in Belize,” says Tanya Amaya, CORAL’s regional program director. “A tourism destination is more than just a place to visit, it is also a community. By building a culture of sustainable tourism, we can also help protect and create benefits for the community, like securing clean water or promoting safety.”  Currently, we are collaborating with relevant stakeholders to establish a  . This locally managed entity would oversee different aspects of the tourism destination and safeguard the area’s natural and cultural heritage. As part of that initiative, we are also promoting an   for tourism operators, which focuses on ways to teach travelers about conservation.  To support both these sanitation and tourism initiatives, we are maintaining the regional water quality monitoring program in Belize that we launched in 2020. Through this program, we have built a network of partners that monitor offshore water quality across 90 sites in the Western Caribbean in order to determine the impact of land-based pollution in high-tourism areas and identify areas that require wastewater and sanitation interventions.  Land-based pollution, often a result of inefficient wastewater management, uncontrolled coastal development, and unsustainable agricultural activities, can bring excess nutrients that spur algal growth. When algae become too prominent on coral reefs, they can block the sunlight that reaches corals (an important source of nutrients) and impact the overall health of the ecosystem and its animals.  “Monitoring water quality in Belize gives us the necessary data to advocate for more sustainable projects and solutions in the region,” says Amaya. “Together with local partners and community members, we are fighting for the health of key coral reefs and supporting coastal communities that are dependent on those ecosystems.”  Thanks to our partnership with the BTB, we are able to push forward these important initiatives in Belize. We look forward to continuing this ongoing partnership and celebrating the success it brings this year."

This choice not only benefits our skin but also  . Furthermore, embracing “reef-safe” habits extends beyond the beach. Sunscreen residue can find its way into oceans through waterways and showers, underlining the need for responsible practices even beyond sandy shores. By choosing an alternative to sunscreen, we contribute to a broader movement that harmonizes our well-being with environmental preservation. As we make these mindful choices, we collectively create a ripple effect that resonates far beyond ourselves, nurturing a world where personal comfort aligns seamlessly with the protection of our precious ecosystems.  Picking up beach litter, reducing plastic consumption, adhering to responsible diving and snorkeling practices, supporting legislation for climate solutions, and contributing to worthy causes are all avenues through which we can protect and preserve these invaluable coral ecosystems. Dr. Helen Fox, CORAL’s Conservation Science Director, emphasizes that   in coral reef conservation. A multifaceted approach is necessary. By continually educating ourselves and taking meaningful actions, we enhance the chances of coral reef survival. Bottom line: the responsibility to safeguard coral reefs is up to each of us. By making informed choices and taking action, we can be the driving force behind positive change, ensuring the future vitality of these remarkable natural wonders."

Network members meet regularly to learn from and support each other in efforts to protect and restore ocean ecosystems. CORAL’s role within the network will be to provide technical expertise and help implement projects, and CORAL’s Regional Program Director for the Main Hawaiian Islands,  , will oversee this partnership. The invitation is an incredible honor and a testament to CORAL’s—and Mejia’s—history of building collaborative programs to save coral reefs in the region. “It’s very validating that the network sees CORAL can add value,” shares Mejia. “They spent a lot of time on their governance documents and fine-tuned their procedures in order to vet members. All seven community groups examine and vote for prospective members. They need to see the value and the synergy, and you have to be very present in the years leading up to your invitation to join.” Mejia has participated in the network before.

Their hard work and dedication helps CORAL achieve our mission of uniting communities to save coral reefs. Among this stellar network of volunteers, Charley Dofa stands out as an exceptional volunteer and a local hero. Raised on the grounds of the old Olowalu Sugar Company in West Maui, Charley’s responsibility to mālama ‘aina (take care of the land) began at a young age while helping his grandpa in the family garden. Charley’s natural ability to work the land transitioned into a career in landscaping and later, a heavy machinery operation. Maui has a rich agricultural history with pineapple and sugar plantations, but in the early 21  century plantations started to shut down and many workers lost their jobs. Charley witnessed firsthand how difficult it was for people to afford fresh produce and maintain a consistent connection to the land. “That’s when I became motivated to start a community farm. To help people grow their own food. To make peoples’ dreams come true.” In 2011, with the help of Tova Callender of the West Maui Ridge to Reef Initiative, Charley started the organic  , of which he is currently the Vice President. “It’s hard for families now because you have to work multiple jobs just to get by, so the garden is a good place to grow what they would need to spend money on. It’s a no-brainer. People start to see how empowering it is to grow your own food. It tastes better because it’s grown from your own heart.” Charley’s knowledge about gardening and farming is a major asset to CORAL’s work. In West Maui, fallow agricultural lands and the design of dirt roads within these plantations creates easy pathways for sediment to travel to the ocean. In West Maui, CORAL’s   Initiative prevents sediment and nutrient pollution from reaching the ocean and degrading reefs. CORAL staff and volunteers like Charley plant native vegetation near decommissioned roads adjacent to streams in fallow agricultural lands, a practice called replanting. Replanting helps to restore ecosystem services, slow and infiltrate the flow of storm water, and plant roots stabilize soil to reduce erosion and sediment from reaching and smothering our coral reefs. Throughout the years, Charley has observed that people and community partnerships are essential for conservation success, which exemplifies CORAL’s mission of uniting communities to save coral reefs. “The biggest impact is when people have the opportunity to get involved in the process. Through working, one learns.” CORAL is uniting the community of West Maui with the help of volunteers like Charley, and recently established Native Planting Days for volunteers to participate in our stream restoration techniques. We want to Mahalo Charley Dofa for all the work he does to support conservation projects in West Maui. If you’d like to volunteer with CORAL, please fill out our Volunteer Interest Form at  .

What does this road a mile from the shoreline have to do with coral reefs? And how can bikers help? In West Maui, water pollution from old dirt roads has led to a decline of coral cover from 30 to just 10 percent in the last fifteen years. Stormwater runoff also regularly causes the Hawaiʻi Department of Health to issue “Brown Water Advisories”, which are warnings to the public to avoid swimming or fishing because of risks to human health. Beach closures negatively impact Hawaii’s natural and cultural heritage, as well as the tourism industry. CORAL, our partners, and volunteers from the community are working to address this threat by planting native plants and deep-rooted grasses along dirt roads that run adjacent to streams. Bringing back native vegetation helps trap sediments and stabilize the soil, while also improving habitat for native plants and animals and creating opportunities for local communities to reconnect with the land. Every month CORAL hosts a Watershed Restoration Day, where a team of volunteers plants native seedlings across abandoned dirt roads. So far, over 200 volunteers have planted approximately 8,000 plants, which are effectively reducing sediment pollution across West Maui. Motorcyclists recreationally traveling along these roads were unknowingly running over our seedlings and sediment traps, rendering them ineffective. When CORAL staff realized this, we decided to create an educational poster asking bikers for their collaboration. The signs explain the connection between these plants and coral reefs and respectfully asks bikers to take an alternative road. The bikers are listening. Since the signs were installed, we no longer find our plants being damaged by biker wheels. We can all do our small part to help, and CORAL is excited to engage this new and unexpected ally in protecting Maui’s coral reefs!"

Jen is CORAL’s Program Manager in Maui, and she’s leading the charge on restoring Maui’s once lush forest to stabilize the soil and protect coral reefs downstream from being smothered by sediment, reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. Jen’s work takes place in two watersheds of West Maui – Honokõwai and Wahikuli – that were identified as “priority watersheds” by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The uphill location of CORAL’s restoration projects tends to surprise people, but what many people don’t realize is that what happens on land has a direct impact on the shoreline. During heavy rainfall, soil and contaminants in watersheds enter streams, travel downstream, and get dumped directly into the ocean. Because ocean currents travel from West Maui’s shores to the coastlines of neighboring islands, these pollutants can end up on coral reefs near and far. The name Wahikuli means “the noisy place” in Hawaiian, named for the sound of rushing water and the loud birds that lived in the cava and breadfruit trees. The forest of native plants once held the soil in place, but now the trees, birds, and water are all gone, and the only sound left is the wind rustling over fallow fields. Decades of commercial farming for sugarcane and pineapple leveled the forest and left a network of dirt roads that provide the ideal conditions for massive amounts of sediment to enter streams and the ocean during rainstorms. Jen’s work isn’t easy. She’s trying to reverse the effects of decades of industrial agriculture by bringing back the forest. She’s also dealing with modern-day challenges, like motorcyclists accidentally running over saplings and monitoring equipment being stolen. Yet she and our team in Maui have made incredible progress, building on years of research by local partners and working groups. Jen leads CORAL’s monthly  , where a team of volunteers plant native seedlings across abandoned roads to prevent erosion. So far, over 200 volunteers have planted approximately 8,000 plants that hold the soil in place and reduce pollution for coral reefs downstream. This work comes at a critical time; Hawaiian reefs are currently experiencing a bleaching event from the warming waters of climate change. But by providing clean water for coral reefs in Maui and across the Hawaiian islands, we can help corals survive these bleaching events and remain a part of Hawaiʻi’s rich landscape and culture."

        "content": "10-year-old Abby Rogers has converted her backyard into a native plant nursery to help save coral reefs. Rogers is a volunteer with the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL), helping to grow native plants that will be transplanted at their stream restoration site in Wahikuli. The native plants trap sediment that runs off the slope and into the ocean where it smothers coral reefs. Typically, CORAL purchases the plants and hosts volunteer planting days at the stream restoration site. But when COVID-19 restrictions hit and the group planting days were no longer safe, the team put a call out to volunteers to grow the plants at home from seed. “I really wanted to do things for the environment, but had not found a way to really help besides not using a straw or bringing my own bags to the store,” says Rogers. “My mom read about [the CORAL project] in a newspaper article and suggested it to me.” Originally, Rogers signed up to take home three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But once she realized how much fun it was, she signed up for 15 more kits. That brings her total to 900 native plants. Rogers has certainly taken the plunge into her first-ever volunteer project. “I have always been interested in the environment because I have always wanted to help the world,” says the 5  grader. “I spent seven years in China, where I learned firsthand about air and water pollution. Now, living in Hawai‘i, I have been looking for ways I can make a positive impact on the environment.” Rogers is one of 100 volunteers who signed up to grow 25,000 seeds for CORAL. Since not all seeds tend to germinate, CORAL estimates that about 10,000 plants will ultimately be transplanted. “She’s our most prolific volunteer,” says Larissa Treese, CORAL’s Program Coordinator on Maui and the coordinator behind the at-home plant growing volunteer program. “It’s so great seeing the next generation stepping up to save coral reefs—the amount of sediment we’ll be able to trap with the plants she’s growing will definitely have an impact.” Once a volunteer signs up to participate, CORAL provides them with the seeds and instructions on how to grow them. Volunteers can choose whether to donate the rest of the supplies (soil, trays and pots) or whether to borrow them from CORAL. Once the plants are fully grown, the volunteer can return them to CORAL to be transplanted or they can visit the restoration site and transplant them themselves.   CORAL has been engaged in slope restoration in West Maui for several years, using native plants and trees to restore Maui’s once lush forests and reversing the effects of decades of industrial agriculture for sugarcane and pineapple. The key to CORAL’s success is building strong local partnerships. The restoration project in Wahikuli is a testament to that, bringing together partners like Maui Nui Botanical Gardens, West Maui Ridge 2 Reef and Down the Hatch. “The at-home native plant kits have been a terrific way to bring the community together and keep our volunteers engaged, since we can’t meet in person anymore,” says Treese. “It’s also helped us save the money that we would typically spend on purchasing the fully grown plants.”"

The first Earth Day brought 20 million people together to rally for the protection of the environment, and later that year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed and the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts were passed. Since then, Earth Day has grown to a global event, with people around the world coming together to protect our environment. Almost 50 years later, our planet and its inhabitants are suffering as climate change causes severe ocean heat waves and   We’ve also seen the   over the past 30 years. These devastating consequences of climate change are becoming the new normal for our time. However, if we come together and raise our voices for solutions in the same way that we did when Earth Day was founded, there’s still hope for the state of our world and its inhabitants. At CORAL, we’re developing and promoting solutions that help coral reefs adapt to the effects of climate change so that corals and the ecosystems they support can be celebrated 50 years from now. Our   address local threats to reefs, including water pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction. Our   research shows that when these local threats are reduced, corals are more able to adapt to rising ocean temperatures. By creating networks of healthy reefs, we can ensure the survival of coral reefs for generations to come. We know that the best way to reduce local stressors is in partnership with the people that interact with and depend on coral reefs. For example, in Honduras, our partnerships with residents, business owners, and the government have improved water quality to meet international safe swimming standards in West End, Roatán. We also partnered with local non-profits to make sure that the marine protected areas (MPAs) that we helped establish are effectively managed and well-patrolled, resulting in increased fish biomass. Efforts like these are  , and because this work is part of a network, these reefs contribute to adaptation and repopulation across the entire Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) system. In addition to this work in the MAR, we are creating the conditions that will help corals adapt to the effects of climate change in Hawai’i and with partners in the Caribbean and around the world. But we need your help!  If we rally together the same way we did 50 years ago, our collective efforts can encourage our leaders, industries, and the world to take action to save coral reefs and our planet’s other vital ecosystems. We’ll be sharing more about how we can save coral reefs together during our Earth Day webinar on April 22 . I hope to see you there!"

You’re enjoying a sunny day in the lagoon surrounded by green mangroves, birds singing to one another and monkeys playing among the branches. In the distance, you see local fishermen making their livelihoods, casting lines and nets from offshore hoping for a catch. Unfortunately, the lagoon is under constant threat from overfishing by outside communities who are not complying with the local fishing regulations. In turn, overfishing causes a decline in populations of the reef fish that depend on lagoons as nurseries for their young. Fortunately, the recently passed Ministerial Decree 108-2017 is designed to protect this vital water source that provides food and income for the surrounding 13 communities. Since 2011, CORAL’s Honduras field team and our partners have worked collaboratively in Tela to encourage communication and cooperation among local communities, organizations and government entities. After several years of supporting and working hand in hand with these entities, the Tela Environmental and Protected Areas Interinstitutional Committee was formally recognized and tasked with bringing together all the key players to protect the natural coastal and marine resources of Tela Bay. In 2015, after successfully creating a  , the Committee started discussing solutions to protect the lagoon from unsustainable fishing practices. After two years of meetings between the Interinstitutional Committee and affected communities, they agreed to new fishing regulations which were passed as a law by the Honduran Livestock and Agriculture Secretariat in April 2017. Through successful enforcement of the Ministerial Decree’s stricter fishing regulations and priority access for local fisherman, the idyllic scene I described earlier of the thriving lagoon providing livelihoods for the local community will become a near-term reality for Laguna de Los Micos. ***************** Imagínese sentado en una lancha pequeña en la   en la costa norte de Honduras, a pocos kilómetros al oeste de Tela. Estás disfrutando de un día soleado en la laguna rodeado de verdes manglares, pájaros cantando entre sí y monos jugando entre las ramas. En la distancia, se ve a los pescadores locales ganándose el sustento, lanzando líneas y redes desde la costa con la esperanza de pescar algo. Desafortunadamente, la laguna está bajo la amenaza constante de la sobrepesca por parte de comunidades externas que no cumplen con las normas de pesca locales. A su vez, la sobrepesca provoca una disminución de las poblaciones de peces de arrecife que dependen de las lagunas como criaderos para sus crías. Afortunadamente, el Decreto Ministerial 108-2017 recientemente aprobado está diseñado para proteger esta fuente vital de agua que proporciona alimentos e ingresos a las 13 comunidades circundantes. Desde 2011, el equipo de campo de CORAL en Honduras y nuestros aliados han trabajado hombro a hombro en Tela para fomentar la comunicación y la cooperación entre las comunidades locales, organizaciones y entidades gubernamentales.

Luego de dos años de reuniones entre el Comité Interinstitucional y las comunidades afectadas, acordaron nuevas normas de pesca que fueron aprobadas como ley por la Secretaría de Agricultura y Ganadería de Honduras en abril de 2017. A través de la aplicación exitosa de las normas de pesca más estrictas del Decreto Ministerial y el acceso prioritario para los pescadores locales, la escena idílica que describimos anteriormente de la próspera laguna que proporciona medios de vida a la comunidad local se convertirá en una realidad a corto plazo para Laguna de Los Micos."

        "content": "It’s 2011 and Jenny Myton, CORAL’s Associate Program Director for the Mesoamerican Reef, is diving in the murky waters of Tela Bay, Honduras. Her husband rolls into the water after her and hears Jenny scream. He panics: is she OK? As he swims down to her he also starts to yell but they are both yelling in excitement because—astonishingly—the bottom is covered in live coral. Coral cover has declined across the Caribbean, from near 80 percent in the 1970s to about 18 percent today. Somehow, the corals in Tela have defied that trend: live coral cover is an astounding 69 percent. Now six years later, I have a chance to see these amazing reefs for myself. My own journey to Tela starts with lunch in Miami. No, not that Miami—this is Miami, Honduras: a ragtag collection of wooden houses perched on stilts and crowded onto a narrow strip of sand between the Caribbean Sea and  . This lagoon is an important nursery habitat for many species of reef fish. While Tela’s reefs are amazing for their live coral cover, they have a noticeable lack of fish. This has many worried that the entire local system sits on the edge of an ecological precipice. For these corals to continue to thrive, they need fish—especially herbivorous fish who help control algal growth. However, for the reef to have fish, it needs the lagoon. This lagoon also provides essential food and income for thirteen communities that ring its shores. These communities and others exert enormous fishing pressure on the lagoon, which means very few fish actually survive to make it to the reef. CORAL has been working in Tela for the last four years to reduce overfishing in a way that doesn’t harm the lagoon’s human communities. After my lunch in Miami, Jenny and I pile into a boat on the lagoon with some of Tela’s managers. We are on our way to visit one community— —to see how people, the reef and lagoon interact. My first impression of the lagoon is that it is huge: it takes us forty-five minutes to cross it. Mangroves crowd its shores, their barnacle-clad roots sticking up from water that is bright green and soupy looking. Where the edge is sandy, it is full of birds, including egrets, herons and one pale pink spoonbill. As we near the far shore, there’s a young boy waving at us from a sand bar. He stands next to a tree branch sporting a tattered piece of red fabric, which marks a channel entrance into the forest. The entrance is so shallow that the boat has to be pushed into the channel. We slide over sand past thick reeds that crowd into the boat from both sides. Once we are afloat again, we motor slowly into the forest. The view of mountains is eclipsed by large trees and a deep hot hush settles over us. We step from the boat onto a muddy bank and start our kilometer-long walk through the thick heat to Marion. The first thing I notice when we reach the village is an abandoned house that’s half buried in sand. Marion sits directly under a levee next to a river. In 2014, the levee burst and the village was quickly inundated. Not everyone survived the flood and those who did lost everything. Marion is a poor community without running water or electricity. Yet, as we walk down the wide sandy track through the middle of the village and past the brightly painted school, the feeling is one of happiness and joy. Kids play in the middle of the town, people stop to talk to us. It’s peaceful here. We turn left down a small track toward our final destination. We are greeted by decorative palm fronds and balloons. Balloons! Marion is celebrating the opening of a new cooperative store. A $2,300 micro-grant from CORAL has stocked the shelves with bags of flour, rice and beans, pens and Coca Cola. The store’s profit-sharing agreement provides members with an alternative form of income that helps the community endure the fishing closed season and the reductions in catch limits that will be required to rebuild the ecosystem. The cooperative’s members greet us with smiles and hugs, speeches and more than a few tears of gratitude. Such a small thing for us has made such a big difference for these people. They are still recovering from the flood, and opening this store gives them hope that their community will survive. The next day, I head out to the reef. Rolling into the water, I experience the same thing Jenny did six years earlier. I too am yelling into my regulator in amazement: there is so much coral! Even now, two months after my visit to Tela, picturing those reefs fills me with hope. In Tela, corals have figured out how to adapt to and thrive in less than ideal conditions. By including this area in CORAL’s Mesoamerican   —a large network of diverse and connected healthy reefs—baby corals from Tela can travel to other locations, taking with them the special genetic material that allowed their parents to thrive in murky waters. Communities like Marion also give me hope. Earlier this year,   was passed into law in Tela Bay. This approach to fisheries management ensures that each of Tela’s communities has exclusive access to a portion of the catch. What they don’t fish today will be available to them tomorrow. In conjunction with alternative livelihoods—like the cooperative store in Marion—these communities are able to make decisions to not fish. By including communities in solutions that help save coral reefs, we create win-wins that give everyone hope for the future.   ******************** En el año 2011 Jenny Myton, la Directora Regional de Programa de CORAL para la Región Mesoamericana, está buceando en las aguas turbias de la Bahía de Tela, Honduras. Su esposo se sumerge detrás de ella y escucha a Jenny gritar. Entra en pánico: ¿Estará bien? Al nadar hacia ella, también comienza a gritar, pero ambos gritan de emoción porque, sorprendentemente, el fondo está cubierto de coral vivo. La cobertura de coral ha disminuido en todo el Caribe, de tener cerca del 80 por ciento en la década de 1970 a alrededor del 18 por ciento en la actualidad. De alguna manera, los corales en Tela han desafiado esa tendencia: la cobertura de coral vivo es un asombroso 69 por ciento. Ahora, seis años después, tengo la oportunidad de ver estos increíbles arrecifes por mí mismo. Mi propio viaje a Tela comienza con un almuerzo en Miami. No, no ese Miami, estamos en Miami, Honduras: una colección irregular de casas de madera encaramadas sobre pilotes y apiñadas en una estrecha franja de arena entre el Mar Caribe y la  . Esta laguna es un importante hábitat de cría de muchas especies de peces arrecifales. Si bien los arrecifes de Tela son increíbles por su cobertura de coral vivo, tienen una notable falta de peces. Esto ha causado que muchos se preocupen que todo el sistema local se encuentre al borde de un desastre ecológico. Ya que para que estos corales continúen prosperando, necesitan peces, especialmente peces herbívoros que ayudan a controlar el crecimiento de algas. Sin embargo, para que el arrecife tenga peces, necesita de la laguna. Esta laguna también proporciona alimentos e ingresos esenciales para trece comunidades que rodean sus costas. Estas comunidades y otras ejercen una enorme presión pesquera en la laguna, lo que significa que muy pocos peces sobreviven para llegar al arrecife. CORAL ha estado trabajando en Tela durante los últimos cuatro años para reducir la sobrepesca de una manera que no cause daño a las comunidades de la laguna. Después de mi almuerzo en Miami, Jenny y yo nos subimos a un bote en la laguna con algunos de los gerentes de Tela. Vamos a visitar una comunidad, , para ver cómo interactúan las personas, el arrecife y la laguna. Mi primera impresión de la laguna es que es enorme: tardamos cuarenta y cinco minutos en cruzarla. Los manglares abarrotan sus orillas, sus raíces cubiertas de percebes sobresalen del agua, de color verde brillante y de aspecto viscoso. Donde la orilla es arenosa, está lleno de aves, incluidas garzas, garcetas y un pájaro pico espátula rosa pálido. Cuando nos acercamos a la costa lejana, hay un niño que nos saluda desde un banco de arena. Está de pie junto a la rama de un árbol con un trozo trapo rojo, que marca un canal de entrada al bosque. La entrada es tan poco profunda que hay que empujar el barco hacia el canal. Nos deslizamos sobre la arena entre gruesos juncos que se amontonan en el bote desde ambos lados. Una vez que estamos a flote nuevamente, nos internamos lentamente en el bosque. La vista de las montañas se ve eclipsada por grandes árboles y un profundo silencio se posa sobre nosotros. Salimos del bote a una orilla fangosa y comenzamos nuestra caminata de un kilómetro a través del denso calor hasta Marion. Lo primero que noto al llegar al pueblo es una casa abandonada que está medio enterrada en la arena. Marion está asentada directamente debajo de un bordo al lado de un río. En 2014, el bordo cedió y la aldea se inundó rápidamente. No todos sobrevivieron a la inundación y los que sobrevivieron lo perdieron todo. Marion es una comunidad pobre sin agua corriente ni electricidad. Sin embargo, mientras caminamos por el ancho camino arenoso que atraviesa el centro del pueblo y pasamos por la escuela pintada de colores brillantes, la sensación es de felicidad y alegría. Los niños juegan en el centro del pueblo, la gente se detiene para hablarnos. Este es un lugar tranquilo. Giramos a la izquierda por un pequeño sendero hacia nuestro destino final. Nos reciben hojas de palmera decorativas y globos. ¡Globos! Marion está celebrando la apertura de una nueva tienda cooperativa. Un micro-subsidio de $ 2,300 de CORAL ha llenado los estantes con bolsas de harina, arroz y frijoles, bolígrafos y Coca Cola. El acuerdo participativo en las ganancias de la tienda brinda a los miembros una forma alternativa de ingresos que ayuda a la comunidad a soportar la temporada de veda de pesca y las reducciones en los límites de captura que se requerirán para reconstruir el ecosistema. Los socios de la cooperativa nos saludan con sonrisas y abrazos, discursos y más de una lágrima de gratitud. Algo tan pequeño para nosotros ha marcado una gran diferencia para estas personas. Todavía se están recuperando de la inundación y la apertura de esta tienda les da la esperanza de que su comunidad sobrevivirá. Al día siguiente, me dirijo al arrecife. Al entrar en el agua, experimento lo mismo que Jenny seis años antes. Yo también grito en mi regulador con asombro: ¡hay tanto coral! Incluso ahora, dos meses después de mi visita a Tela, imaginar esos arrecifes me llena de esperanza. En Tela, los corales han encontrado la manera de adaptarse y prosperar en condiciones poco ideales. Al incluir esta zona en el Paisaje Arrecifal Adaptativo Mesoamericano de CORAL -una gran red de arrecifes sanos, diversos y conectados- los corales jóvenes de Tela pueden viajar a otros lugares, llevando consigo el material genético especial que permitió a sus progenitores prosperar en aguas turbias. Comunidades como Marion también me dan esperanza. A principios de este año, la   se convirtió en ley en la Bahía de Tela. Este enfoque de manejo pesquero asegura que cada una de las comunidades de Tela tenga acceso exclusivo a una porción de la captura. Lo que no pescan hoy estará disponible para ellos mañana. Junto con medios de vida alternativos -como la tienda cooperativa de Marion- estas comunidades pueden tomar la decisión de no pescar. Al incluir a las comunidades en las soluciones que contribuyen a salvar los arrecifes de coral, creamos soluciones beneficiosas para todos que dan esperanza al futuro."

        "content": "Coral reefs provide an important source of food and income for coastal and island communities around the world. But more than 55 percent of reefs are threatened by overfishing globally. Overfishing not only disrupts the delicate ecology of coral reefs, it also negatively impacts the local communities that depend on them. If fishers are unable to catch enough fish, they may struggle to make a living or feed their families. That’s where bees and chickens come in. Entrepreneurial “income diversification” projects, like raising egg-laying chickens or keeping honeybees, offer new ways for fishers and their families to earn money. When communities have the skills and resources to generate income in new ways, they don’t need to overfish. The result is a win-win solution, in which people are no longer over-reliant on a single resource, while depleted fish stocks and coral reef ecosystems get the chance to recover and thrive. As part of our   initiative, CORAL collaborates with local communities to develop tailored, locally appropriate income diversification projects. Some such examples include our egg-laying chicken project in coastal Honduras and our beekeeping project in Waivunia, Fiji. We help build the capacity of local people to learn skills like how to run an artisan shop or become a tour guide operator — always taking into consideration communities’ preferences and interests and the availability of materials for start-up and maintenance. One of our greatest success stories comes from the Micos Lagoon on the north coast of Honduras. With its natural beauty and high biodiversity, the lagoon is the ecological, social, and economic heart of Blanca Jeannette Kawas National Park. It serves as a nursery habitat where juvenile reef fish spend their lives before populating Tela Bay’s coral reefs. Unfortunately, water pollution, overfishing, and unsustainable fishing practices (like using fishing nets with illegal mesh sizes) have caused overexploitation of the lagoon. In July 2017, Micos lagoon experienced a number of hypoxic events that devastated the food chain, leaving more than 500 fishers and their families without their usual income. Shortly thereafter, CORAL began work with the fishing community of Los Cerritos to create an egg-laying hen project. We partnered with a cooperative of 12 women who are either fishers themselves or married to fishers, and gave them a microgrant for the purchase of 120 egg-laying hens. After a year of construction, learning, and trial and error, the hens are now providing an alternative source of protein for the community and helping them adapt to new fishing regulations and changing environmental conditions (e.g. hypoxic events) in the lagoon. Income diversification activities like this one not only reduce fishing pressure but also engender goodwill and increase compliance with local fishing regulations. Together with scientific monitoring, enforcement patrols, sustainable policies, and education, they are a highly valuable conservation strategy for people and reefs. *************** Los arrecifes de coral proporcionan una importante fuente de alimentos e ingresos para las comunidades costeras e insulares de todo el mundo. Pero más del 55 por ciento de los arrecifes están amenazados por la sobrepesca a nivel mundial. La sobrepesca no solo altera la delicada ecología de los arrecifes de coral, sino que también afecta negativamente a las comunidades locales que dependen de ellos. Si los pescadores no pueden obtener suficientes peces, pueden tener dificultades para ganarse la vida o alimentar a sus familias. Aquí es donde entran en juego las abejas y los pollos. Los proyectos empresariales de “diversificación de ingresos”, como la cría de gallinas ponedoras o la cría de abejas, ofrecen nuevas formas para que los pescadores y sus familias ganen dinero. Cuando las comunidades tienen las habilidades y los recursos para generar ingresos de nuevas maneras, no necesitan pescar en exceso. El resultado es una solución en la que todos salimos ganando y en la que las personas dejan de depender en exceso de un único recurso, al tiempo que las poblaciones de peces ya agotadas y los ecosistemas de los arrecifes de coral tienen la oportunidad de recuperarse y prosperar. Como parte de nuestra iniciativa de  , CORAL colabora con las comunidades locales para desarrollar proyectos de diversificación de ingresos adaptados y localmente apropiados. Algunos de estos ejemplos incluyen nuestro proyecto de gallinas ponedoras en la costa de Honduras y nuestro proyecto de apicultura en Waivunia, Fiji. Ayudamos a capacitar a la población local para que aprenda a administrar una tienda de artesanías o a convertirse en operador de guías turísticos, siempre teniendo en cuenta las preferencias e intereses de las comunidades y la disponibilidad de materiales para su puesta en funcionamiento y mantenimiento. Una de nuestras mayores historias de éxito viene de la Laguna de Micos en la costa norte de Honduras. Con su belleza natural y alta biodiversidad, la laguna es el corazón ecológico, social y económico del Parque Nacional Blanca Jeannette Kawas. Sirve como hábitat de cría donde los peces arrecifales juveniles pasan su vida antes de poblar los arrecifes de coral de la Bahía de Tela. Desafortunadamente, la contaminación del agua, la sobrepesca y las prácticas de pesca insostenibles (como el uso de redes de pesca con tamaños de malla ilegales) han provocado la sobreexplotación de la laguna. En julio de 2017, la laguna de Los Micos experimentó una serie de eventos hipóxicos que devastaron la cadena alimentaria, dejando a más de 500 pescadores y sus familias sin sus ingresos habituales. Poco tiempo después, CORAL comenzó a trabajar con la comunidad pesquera de Los Cerritos para crear un proyecto de gallinas ponedoras. Nos asociamos con una cooperativa de 12 mujeres que son pescadoras o están casadas con pescadores, y les dimos una micro subvención para la compra de 120 gallinas ponedoras. Tras un año de construcción, aprendizaje y ensayo y error, las gallinas son ahora una fuente alternativa de proteínas para la comunidad y les ayudan a adaptarse a las nuevas normas de pesca y a los cambios en las condiciones ambientales (por ejemplo, los eventos hipóxicos) en la laguna. Las actividades de diversificación de ingresos como esta no solo reducen la presión pesquera, sino que también generan buena voluntad y aumentan el cumplimiento de las normas pesqueras locales. Junto con el monitoreo científico, el patrullaje de vigilancia, las políticas sostenibles y la educación, constituyen una estrategia de conservación muy valiosa para las personas y los arrecifes."

        "content": "It’s October, a time when eerie legends come alive and the world’s most frightening monsters are out to play. But among the goblins, ghosts, and creepy clowns, here at CORAL, there’s a different type of beast that truly spooks us—climate change.  Sure, climate change doesn’t look like a typical monster. It doesn’t have fangs like a vampire or howl like a werewolf. But climate change is real and more terrifying than anything you’ll encounter on Halloween night. In fact, it’s threatening our planet each and every day. Climate change is responsible for an increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, a dramatic rise in sea level, and a devastating decline in biodiversity. It contributes to food insecurity and impacts human health. And for our beautiful, valuable coral reefs—warming ocean temperatures threaten their existence entirely. That’s why at CORAL, we’ve turned science into action and committed to helping coral reefs adapt to a changing climate.   in a temperature range of 73° to 84° F, and most corals are living close to their upper thermal limit. When ocean waters are too warm, in addition to direct threats like overfishing or water pollution, corals get stressed. In reaction to the stress, hard corals expel small, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in the coral tissue and act as their primary food source. Without zooxanthellae, corals get sick and enter a “bleached state.” Their notably bright, vibrant colors turn to ghostly white, and if left bleached for too long, they will die.  According to a   released by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, large scale coral bleaching events—caused by climate change—are the greatest disturbance to reefs. In fact, these events have contributed to the loss of at least 14 percent of the world’s corals in the last decade. Corals have survived for a long time and are known for their resilience. Research shows that corals can adapt to a changing climate if we slow down emissions and reduce local stressors.  In contribution to a worldwide effort, we’re partnering with  , a comprehensive map and monitoring system of the world’s shallow water coral reefs. This new, innovative tool uses satellites to detect coral bleaching in real time—which will be a vital resource to push policies and take urgent, necessary action.  Andrea Rivera-Sosa, CORAL’s Project and Outreach Manager, is contributing to the project by working with a global network of field scientists, who will get into the water during a bleaching event to verify what the satellites are detecting in space. “Climate change is a serious issue affecting coral reefs,” says Rivera-Sosa. “This tool provides evidence of bleaching that we hope can be leveraged to decision makers to help reduce the impacts of climate change at the global scale.”  In addition to this worldwide effort, we are also working at the local level to mitigate direct threats to reefs, which make it harder for corals to adapt to climate change. This includes addressing overfishing and minimizing pollutants that enter ocean waters.  There’s no question about it—we have a lot of work to do. Governments,  , and  all need to take urgent action, or risk losing the world’s most valuable and vulnerable ecosystem.  So this Halloween, don’t fret about those silly zombies, witches, and killer robots. Instead,   as we face the scariest monster of them all—climate change.  "

It is well documented that climate change is causing corals to die off at an unprecedented rate, but our study provides tools that offer promise for their survival. Our results show that when evolution is enabled, conservation efforts can help corals adapt to rising temperatures.” -Dr. Madhavi Colton, co-author and Program Director at the Coral Reef Alliance. Predictions about the future of coral reefs that don’t include adaptation paint a grim picture of the consequences of climate change, predicting that rising temperatures could result in a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Our results, however, suggest that management and evolution together can help corals adapt to rising temperatures. The study found that the likelihood of successful adaptation increases if local threats to reefs are reduced through effective management. Effectively managing reefs includes protecting them from overfishing and water pollution, which improves local conditions for corals. Managed areas serve as sources of repopulation over the long term–corals in managed areas rescue the rest of the reef. Importantly, the diversity-based conservation strategies performed well under a variety of assumptions and future conditions. This demonstrates that we know enough of the science to act now to establish spatial management networks that include a diversity of reef types and habitats. With the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste. The study shows that managing reefs to facilitate evolution today and, in the future, can enhance their chances of long-term survival. Managing reefs to facilitate evolution means creating networks of coral reefs where local stressors are reduced and a diversity of coral types and habitats are protected. Conservation planners can facilitate adaptation even in the face of ongoing and unpredictable change by prioritizing diversity in coral traits and habitats. Our models suggest that this is the best chance of helping reefs deal with climate change. “The study shows that we know enough of the science to act- and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste.” -Dr. Colton   The research group is currently developing next-generation models that incorporate network connectivity patterns, using real-world data from the Pacific, Coral Triangle and Caribbean to develop regional conservation plans.

        "content": "  At CORAL, our mission is  . That means finding a solution to the biggest threat facing corals today-  . Troubled by warming ocean temperatures and mass coral bleaching events, we launched the Modeling Adaptation Potential (MAP) Project in 2016 to ask a critical question: Can coral reefs adapt to and survive the warming temperatures of climate change? To answer this question, CORAL assembled some of the top experts in coral reef ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation science to figure out if corals can adapt to life on a warming planet and what we can do to help. Scientists from Rutgers University, the University of Washington, the University of Queensland and Stanford came together under CORAL’s leadership to analyze how different conservation solutions perform through time using a suite of mathematical models. The group used models to predict how corals cope with different management strategies and scenarios, as it allowed them to quickly analyze the results instead of waiting for results from live samples. The initial results of the MAP Project were published in the scientific journal   in July 2019, and provide hope for coral reefs by showing that, with the right approaches to conservation, we can help corals evolve to endure rising temperatures. The group found that conservation actions like reducing water pollution and overfishing can help coral health so that they’re better able to take the heat. Many of these solutions can be implemented immediately– and with the effects of climate change only increasing, we have little time to waste. Today we’re acting swiftly by leading the MAP Project team to create actionable conservation guidelines that will be used around the world. CORAL is already using these guidelines to create  , and we recently hosted the MAP Science Advisory Group meeting in Roatán, Honduras to synthesize research into regional coral reef management plans for the Caribbean, Pacific, and Coral Triangle.   to determine where and how to implement their coral restoration efforts to achieve their goal of restoring one million corals across the Caribbean. By partnering with scientists, conservation organizations, and local reef managers, we’re promoting adaptation as a solution for coral reefs and turning science into action to save coral reefs for generations to come."

        "content": "New results from our pioneering research show that protecting reefs that thrive in warmer waters may be key to helping evolution rescue reefs from the effects of climate change. For the last several years, we’ve been leading research funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and other funders to understand how we can best help coral reefs adapt to climate change. Research by others has already shown that corals have some capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change. But we wanted to know more about how the process of adaptation might unfold over centuries of global warming, so that we could turn that science into action today. What could we do to help this process along? To answer these questions, we partnered with academic researchers to build simulations of reefs and we used them to test how different strategies for protecting coral reefs perform over time. Which strategies were the best at protecting reefs long term? In our first paper published in   in 2019, we reported the need to protect a diversity of coral reefs from local stressors—like overfishing and water pollution. Using our simulations, we’ve been exploring what “diversity” means using real-world data from the Caribbean, Southwest Pacific, and Coral Triangle regions. Our results show that thermal diversity is really important. Our models show that networks of protected areas that include reefs in warmer waters tend to fare better over time. The best explanation is that these reefs contain corals that have already figured out how to thrive in warmer conditions. When these corals reproduce, they send their heat-adapted larvae (baby corals) to other reefs, helping areas across a region cope with rising temperatures. There is one important caveat: these results are based on the assumption that we curb global carbon emissions. If we don’t reduce the amount of warming our planet experiences, even heat-adapted corals will struggle to survive. Now that the research phase of this project is complete, we are turning our attention to translating these findings into action. These results can help us identify the areas that need to be better protected—because in some parts of the world, relatively few “hot” reefs are in marine protected areas. With these new results, we’re in a better position to encourage the establishment and improved management of protected area networks that will help coral reefs adapt to climate change."

But more than just a picturesque beach vacation, oceans are an incredibly valuable component of our planet.  That’s why the  as World Oceans Day, serving as an opportunity to raise awareness about the role that oceans play and how we can protect them. Whether you reside on the coast or live hundreds of miles inland, World Oceans Day is a time for everybody to celebrate and learn how ocean health contributes to the overall health of our planet.  Why are our oceans important? It’s a valid question. Afterall, humans live on land…so why should we care about the health of our oceans and seas?  Besides the fact that oceans are home to countless marine species, they also greatly contribute to the health of animals that live on land and provide many benefits to humans. According to the  , the ocean produces more than 50 percent of the planet’s oxygen and it regulates our climate and weather patterns. We also rely on the ocean to transport goods, and it contributes to the worldwide economy through tourism, food, and other industries. Not to mention, communities across the globe rely on fish for protein and ocean ingredients used to make modern medicine.  Despite all of these incredible benefits, climate change and human impacts are causing our oceans’ health to rapidly diminish and deteriorate. That’s why we, at CORAL, are calling on you to help us protect the ocean this World Oceans Day. At CORAL, we focus on protecting coral reefs, which are unquestionably some of the most valuable underwater ecosystems.  It’s estimated that roughly 25 percent of all marine life depends on coral reefs, with species ranging from sea turtles to parrotfish to reef sharks. They also provide food, economic value, and shoreline protection to coastal communities. One major way you can protect the ocean this World Oceans Day is by taking actions that focus on keeping coral reefs healthy. "

        "content": "Coral reefs provide an important source of food and income for coastal and island communities around the world, but more than 55 percent of reefs are threatened by overfishing globally. Coral reefs depend on fish like parrotfish and surgeonfish to consume seaweeds (also called macroalgae) and prevent them from overgrowing and smothering coral reefs. Entrepreneurial projects, like creating handicrafts to sell to tourists or raising egg-laying chickens, offer new ways for fishers and their families to earn money. When communities have the skills and resources to generate income in new ways, the result is a win-win solution, in which people are no longer as reliant on a single resource for their livelihood, while depleted fish stocks and coral reef ecosystems get the chance to recover and thrive. As part of our   initiative, CORAL collaborates with communities to develop tailored, locally appropriate ways to diversify their sources of income beyond fishing. Some examples include our egg-laying chicken project in coastal Honduras and our beekeeping project in Waivunia, Fiji, which you can  . In these uncertain times, ecotourism—a major source of income for many coral reef destinations—has been severely affected. With tourism revenue temporarily gone, many coral reef communities around the world are turning to overfishing to feed their families. But in the communities where CORAL works, our work to build the resilience of local communities is paying off. Thanks to our work on income diversification, as well as governance and capacity building, these communities are stronger and better able to withstand the unknown. One example of this is our work in the Bay Islands of Honduras, where we have been working with local communities to diversify their skillsets and sources of income. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, CORAL and partners hosted a series of workshops to build the capacity of the Association of Artisans of Roatán, Utila and Guanaja. The artisan women that comprise the Association are already skilled in many handicrafts, such as knitting, sewing, painting and jewelry making. Through the workshops, they added to their repertoire by learning bookbinding—a skill which will allow them to create new products to appeal to tourists and visitors. In addition to diversifying the handicrafts available for sale in Roatán, this workshop also promotes best practices like creating crafts using sustainable materials that do not harm protected species or undermine their cultural heritage. While the coronavirus pandemic has caused an unexpected halt to tourism operations, the women of the association continue to practice their craft and develop their skills under shelter-in-place. The bookbinding workshop was led by Arleth Rivera, a Honduran graduate of the National School of Fine Arts who specializes in book restoration and bookbinding. Ms. Rivera is now offering an online course via Facebook Live and Instagram, which will enable the women to continue their learning and training from the safety of their homes. We are also exploring the potential of marketing and selling the women’s products online. Just like coral reefs, human communities who have the ability to shift and adapt in times of crisis will stand strong—and even thrive—when faced with shocks and stresses. The steps we take today to build community and reef resilience will ensure their survival in the future. We at CORAL are proud of the work we do to help our mutually dependent human and ecological systems become resilient to the complex challenges of our time."

        "content": "There’s a certain romanticized notion of what it must be like to be a coral reef scientist: living in a tropical environment with beautiful white sand beaches, snorkeling and diving every day, surrounded by colorful wildlife and pristine turquoise waters. Sounds dreamy, doesn’t it? And for Dr. Antonella Rivera, Principal Investigator for the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) in Honduras, part of that is true. She does get to visit beautiful tropical environments  . And she occasionally gets to snorkel and dive. But the majority of her days are spent studying something that is entirely NOT romantic:  . Dr. Rivera’s work focuses on the world’s second largest coral reef ecosystem—the Mesoamerican Reef. The Mesoamerican Reef stretches about 700 miles along the coasts of México, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and supports millions of people with food, income and coastal protection. In a typical year, it attracts nearly 16 million tourists to the region, bringing much needed revenue—though that came to a standstill in March 2020 when the global pandemic hit. Despite these obvious benefits, the Mesoamerican Reef is currently listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List—largely due to coastal pollution. Lack of proper and efficient wastewater management in the region often means sewage enters the ocean untreated. As you can imagine, sewage in the ocean poses a serious public health threat, putting a significant strain on the tourism industry. In some cases, tourists have sued hotels, claiming the contaminated waters and beaches made them sick. But the sewage also poses a serious threat to coral reefs. “It’s heartbreaking that every year we’re seeing more and more algae on the reef,” says Dr. Rivera. “It’s obvious that sewage pollution is a big problem in the region, but we just haven’t had the data on a regional scale to prove that.” , it brings nutrients that spur the growth of algae. The algae interfere with coral growth and compete with corals for space, and when that is combined with overfishing and the loss of herbivores who feed on the algae, the algae can quickly overcome the outnumbered corals. The sewage also contributes to coral disease, further stressing the reef. There are few efforts in the region to monitor water quality and better understand the cause and effects of sewage pollution. At CORAL, we have a robust   on the island of Roatán in Honduras that started seven years ago. But at a regional level, data collection is patchy and site-specific, and there’s no platform or organized effort to tell the full story of what’s really happening on the Mesoamerican Reef as a whole. Until now. When tourism came to a standstill in early 2020, Dr. Rivera and the rest of the CORAL team saw it as an opportunity. The low levels of tourism provided the perfect chance to understand the effects that visitors have on the inadequate or non-existent wastewater treatment systems in the region. We quickly partnered with the  ,  , and local partners to launch a regional water quality monitoring program and build upon some of the more local efforts that are already happening. The first phase of the program will explore the effects of tourism on water quality. The team will begin collecting monthly water quality samples in the next few weeks at three major tourism-impacted locations in each country, using parameters that will help quantify the impacts of tourism. As tourists begin to return to the region, the team expects to see a drastic change in water quality. The second phase will explore the effects of other pollution contributors, like agriculture, and will use these data to begin advocating for policy changes. Though Dr. Rivera never anticipated this kind of potty talk would consume her days as a coral reef scientist, she couldn’t be more excited to be diving in. “I’m excited about this new water quality work because it’s a way for us to scale up all the good work we are doing in Roatán,” says Dr. Rivera. “It makes me very optimistic that water quality, and its impact on coastal ecosystems, will finally be on the forefront of research and conservation in the region. We’ll be able to make a considerable impact on reef health.”"

        "content": "We all depend on coral reefs. To most, this may seem like an exaggeration, but coral reefs are vital to the livelihoods of more than 500 million people for food, income, and protection from storms and waves. They support approximately six million fishers and are important culturally to many indigenous people.  While you may assume that coral reefs are thriving as millions of people depend on and care for them, in reality, they are threatened by a combination of stressors. In fact, about 75% of the world’s coral reefs are threatened.  There are many global threats to corals such as coral bleaching, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. Primarily, the increasing amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has caused coral bleaching. When water temperatures rise too high, corals expel their zooxanthellae, tiny algae that live inside coral tissue and act as a food source. Corals can survive this event, but they become more prone to disease and can die if bleaching persists. Unfortunately, coral bleaching is increasing as corals are exposed to high levels of carbon dioxide.  In addition, many locations do not treat their wastewater, which can increase algal growth and nutrient pollution.  Ocean acidification also plays a major factor in threatening coral reefs. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide, gradually making the ocean more acidic. Reef-building corals (hard corals) are negatively affected, altering their ability to grow their skeleton and make the foundation for coral reefs. This makes corals more prone to disease and destruction.  These are only some of the threats to coral reefs. Other direct threats to coral reefs include unsustainable fishing, habitat destruction, and land-based pollution.  Even small actions can make an impact. Here are some ways we protect coral reefs:  1. Use reef-friendly sunscreen 2. Reduce your energy consumption: turn off lights when leaving the house or use public transportation  3. Dive responsibly: admire reefs from a distance and avoid touching them 4. Eat sustainable seafood  5. Recycle and dispose of trash correctly  6.

Each year, about 22 million people visit Quintana Roo, México. The Caribbean coastline offers beautiful clear blue waters, white sand beaches, and easy access to the second-largest reef system in the world—the Mesoamerican Reef. The tourism industry takes a heavy toll on the nearshore reefs. But with our local partners, Amigos de Sian Ka’an and Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, or CONANP), we’re working to build a more sustainable tourism industry. Together, we’re training tourism operators throughout the region on sustainable practices and ways to protect coral reefs. Our partners provide tourism operators with tools on how to work within marine protected areas and how to improve business models as sustainable tourism operators. The trainings used to be in person, but with COVID-19 they are now all virtual. And the virtual format is working—at the September workshop, the fifth workshop in 12 months, nearly 25 tourism operators joined. This year alone we’ve trained nearly 130 tourism operators in Quintana Roo, Belize and Honduras. The workshop follows a train-the-trainer format, so participants learn how to bring what they learn back to their communities and help educate others and create lasting change. Many tourism operators know their marine environment like the back of their hand—but they don’t always understand the resource they rely on. This training is often their first formal introduction to coral reefs and why they’re important. “I’ve been working all these years on the reef, and I always just thought they were rocks and I could step on them and nothing would happen,” says Victor Barreda, one of the participants at the September training. Victor used to be a fisher, but with fish resources becoming more and more scarce and unreliable, he now runs a tourism operation in Quintana Roo. “Thanks to this presentation, now I know.” These trainings not only build a more sustainable tourism industry, but they also help us build a local network of coral reef supporters and partners. These partners will be instrumental down the line in helping us reduce other threats to reefs, like overfishing and poor water quality."

When COVID-19 hit, 10-year-old Abby Rogers was looking for a way to help protect the environment. As a newly certified SCUBA diver, the Maui resident could now see the beautiful underwater world first hand, and her passion for the underwater world was growing. That’s when her mom heard about CORAL’s new volunteer opportunity: growing native plants from home to help protect coral reefs. In West Maui, we rely on our dedicated volunteers and partners to help us restore degraded agricultural lands and stream beds. We use native plants to revegetate the area and trap sediment and nutrients that would otherwise run into the ocean and smother coral reefs. But when our volunteer planting days were canceled in late March, we had to pivot. We started recruiting volunteers to grow native plants at home and hang on to them until a CORAL team member could retrieve them and transplant them, or until it was safe for the volunteer to visit the restoration site and plant them. When Abby signed up, she originally decided to start with three planting kits. Each kit includes equipment and seeds to grow 50 plants. But she quickly realized how much fun it was—she enjoyed taking breaks from distance learning to check on her plants on her patio—and she soon signed up for 15 more kits, bringing her total to 900 native plants. Abby is one of over 100 volunteers who are helping us grow over 25,000 native plant seeds. Since not all seeds will germinate, we anticipate having about 10,000 plants to ultimately transplant at our restoration site. Not only has the project helped us recruit more volunteers who are spreading the word about coral reef conservation, but it also allowed us to save the money we would have otherwise spent on purchasing native plants from a nursery."

        "content": "Our three community scientists in Honduras brought improved fishing practices to the Mesoamerican Reef by building important relationships with fishers. Paola Urrutia, Greissi Lizeth Villatoro, and Ana Bessy Valdez spend their days building relationships with fishers. As our community scientists in Honduras, they travel every morning to popular fisher landing points and meet with the fishers to analyze their catch. They take measurements, ask for anecdotal data, and document all of their findings. The data they collect give us and our partners more insight into local fisheries. They also help local fishers understand what’s happening to their underwater resources. Urrutia, Villatoro, and Valdez are respected members of the communities where they work. They participate in community meetings and report back on their findings. Through their relationships, they’ve created a network of fishers that help support science and understand the importance of rules and regulations. When Urrutia started, 100% of local fishers fished during the closed season. But now, only 10-20% fish illegally. Likewise, Villatoro has noticed that the local crabbing company has stopped buying small, juvenile crabs and fishers have stopped using illegal nets that are more likely to catch younger crabs. All three of our community scientists are women from minority groups who are socially and economically vulnerable. The position of community scientist at CORAL not only provides them with a stable income, but our program coordinators also support them in working toward personal goals and pursuing their education. Urrutia for example, was a community scientist in 2016 before leaving to go back to school. Now that she has graduated, she has returned to CORAL and has taken on more duties. She’s now also supervising the maintenance and data collection from CORAL’s experimental aquaculture project in Tela—a project designed to create an economic alternative for fishers."

        "content": "We created a network of partners on Hawai‘i Island to launch a robust, volunteer-based water quality testing program and began monitoring sites around the island. In 2018, CORAL began building a local group on Hawai‘i Island to monitor water quality. Since then, Hawai‘i Wai Ola has grown to consist of eleven different organizations, volunteer community members, and scientists who champion water quality issues on Hawai‘i Island. The group’s plan was to launch a volunteer team this summer that would regularly collect water quality samples in Kona, Hilo and South Kohala. Their efforts would bring a more robust and consistent understanding of water quality issues across Hawai‘i Island and gather data that could help inform policy and spur action within the local government. Early this year, they   and started building a targeted communications campaign to recruit volunteers. But when COVID-19 hit, the volunteer program was put on hold and in-person training was canceled. As case numbers continued to rise on the island, it became near impossible to allow groups of volunteers to gather in a safe manner to sample, let alone to be trained. Led by CORAL’s Hawai‘i Island Program Manager Erica Perez, the team quickly pivoted so as to not lose momentum. They began converting their volunteer training program into a digital format so they could still train volunteers. And by June, they had started collecting water quality samples on their own without volunteers. They were able to collect three-months-worth of data at 16 sites around the island before the beaches closed in September, and now that beaches have reopened, they’ll be able to collect two more months of data before the end of the year. The data collected between June and September are a blessing in disguise—the islands were closed to tourists during that time and very few people were using beaches. The low-use period will give us an opportunity to understand what water quality looks like without tourists, an opportunity we wouldn’t have had if 2020 hadn’t presented so many challenges."

        "content": "Do you smell that? It’s the stench of rotting eggs…lingering for half a mile inland from the Caribbean shoreline. It’s a stinky reality of this year’s sargassum bloom, or in other words, the overload of seaweed that is washing up on beaches in parts of Mexico, Honduras, Belize, and other nearby areas.   is a seaweed that floats across the ocean in large island-like masses. While floating, the sargassum has many benefits and provides shelter and food for marine life. But once the mass strikes land, it starts to decompose.  While sargassum blooms are a natural occurrence, climate change and direct human impact have led to an explosion of new nutrient-dense seaweed, all accumulating on the beaches in the Mesoamerican Region. The seaweed grows in the Amazon River area and continues to bloom and move with the current, until arriving in the Caribbean. The combination of increased dust blown westward from mining and desertification in the Sahara, mixed with the fertilizer runoff in the Amazon, and overall warming temperatures has led to the perfect conditions for blooming seaweed.  “The seaweed grows quickly,” says Javier Pizaña-Alonso, CORAL’s Program Manager in Cozumel.  “Under these perfect conditions, blooms can double in size in about 18 days. It can become an issue, depending on how long the blooms drift in the ocean.”  Excess of nutrients found in the seaweed doesn’t just smell bad—it also threatens the health of coastal marine environments. The seaweed is rich in nitrogen, sulfur, ammonium, and heavy metals due to excess fertilizer runoff in the Amazon River, which is a result of rainforest deforestation and increased agriculture. “When the sargassum washes up on shore, it degrades and creates a brown tide. This impacts water quality,” says Pizaña-Alonso. Poor water quality is dangerous for animals in the ocean, including our coral reef ecosystems. , there is potential for excessive algae growth, which can quickly take over reef-building corals and destroy the home of more than one million marine species. Furthermore, too much sargassum can smother coral reefs that are close to the shoreline and impact the habits of other animals. And the environmental impact isn’t the only concern. Too much sargassum may also affect the local economy in Mesoamerica, which relies heavily on tourism. “Travelers don’t like the smell and it affects our beautiful beaches,” says Pizaña-Alonso.  There are a lot of factors involved when it comes to solving the sargassum problem. According to Pizaña-Alonso, in Quintana Roo, the navy is trying to collect the seaweed before it comes to shore. Meanwhile, in other affected areas, like Roatan, Honduras, the government has defined a task force and different sectors are advocating for a state of emergency, which will allow for additional funds to be used to address the situation. Despite some controversy, there is also research and testing to see if it is safe to recycle the sargassum. Some are proposing to turn parts of the seaweed into animal feed or mulch. There’s even been experimentation with the idea of using sargassum to make low income homes, notebooks or shoes.   As a next step, Pizaña-Alonso, would love to get involved with the government’s efforts and offer his expertise in marine science. He is also urging governments, corporations, and individuals to learn about this problem and why it is occurring in the first place. By simply lowering our carbon footprint and advocating for the elimination of destructive tactics, like deforestation and mining, we allow for a more balanced planet, and ocean for all. "

This natural wonderland is an essential breeding ground for several endangered species of marine life, including sea turtles, manatees, and American crocodiles, and plays a crucial role in preserving the region’s biodiversity. In addition to its ecological value, the lagoon is also a vital source of livelihood for local communities, serving as a major fishing ground that provides them with a source of food and income. At CORAL, we recognize the critical importance of preserving and conserving Micos Lagoon, not just for the benefit of the region’s wildlife but also for the prosperity of the people who rely on it. That’s why we’re thrilled to announce that together, with our local partners, we were able to establish the area as the first of its kind, a marine/coastal territorial use right system. This groundbreaking step means that we can regulate and monitor artisanal fishing activities in the region more effectively, ensuring that they are sustainable and do not harm the fragile ecosystem of the lagoon. We’re proud to say that our efforts have already yielded results.  . At CORAL, we remain committed to our mission of preserving and protecting the world’s coral reefs and the communities that depend on them, and we look forward to continuing our work at Micos Lagoon and beyond. We are proud to share that our recent efforts to promote sustainable artisanal fisheries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) were highlighted in a featured publication, “ ” (Communities with a voice: The future of artisanal fishing in LAC). Artisanal and subsistence fishing in LAC is critical to the region, but historically, sustainable management has been a challenge. To address this issue, there has been a global trend towards managing the fishing sector through adaptive partnerships. These experiences highlight the importance of collective decision-making and community-led efforts for the conservation and sustainable management of fish resources. Our work seeks to inspire and promote co-management systems that prioritize the rights of fishers and the sustainability of fish resources in LAC. By sharing positive experiences and adaptive learning processes, we hope to empower fishing communities to take an active role in the governance of their countries and the preservation of their valuable resources. We are planning to continue monitoring and patrolling the lagoon to update the ministerial decree using science-based adaptive management.
